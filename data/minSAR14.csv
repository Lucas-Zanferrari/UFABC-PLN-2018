" I ca n't stress this point enough : THE MOVIE SUCKS !!! . The International tries so hard to be a highly intelligent and complex movie and fails so spectacularly that you almost feel sorry for the actors . The biggest accomplishment of Clive Owen is that he actually stayed serious throughout the entire movie . Owen seems not to be able to let go of the character he played in Shoot 'em up . He really seems like the same character , only this time it does n't fit for this movie takes itself seriously , unfortunately . The characters , an interpol agent -LRB- Owen -RRB- and a co-worker of the DA of NY -LRB- Watts -RRB- trace down an evil international bank group and it takes them nearly an hour of the movie to find out that the evil bank may have bought the police -LRB- now how odd is that ? -RRB- . In the end they find out that the bank benefits from war -LRB- WOW !!!!!!!!!!!! -RRB- . These suprising turning points really ruin the concept of the film as a smart economy thriller la Syriana . The only great scenes are the ones where there is no plot at all , for example there 's a great action scene in the Guggenheim . But unfortunately theses scenes are rare . So The International neither works as a smart thriller nor as an entertaining action flick . I ca n't even imagine why a brilliant actress like Naomi Watts would star a movie like this . Clive Owen obviously had better performances like in Closer . Sorry , Tom Twyker . Should have kept on doing your artie farties . " ,2
" The International . The International is not your typical thriller . There is a certain cleverness about the way it was made . To begin with , German director Tom Tykwer -LRB- who gained international renown for Run Lola Run -RRB- and writer Eric Singer have the audacity -LRB- thank god -RRB- to challenge the intelligence of their viewers . Just take the opening clip . You see Louis Salinger -LRB- Clive Owen -RRB- watching his colleague Stumer return from a car where he was speaking to an informant who has information that could bring down the nefarious IBBC bank . Suddenly , Stumer vomits and collapses to the ground . He 's dead . Later Salinger learns that the poison that killed him must have come into effect within a minute . And yet even though Salinger and the viewers saw Stumer for every second of that minute , we have no idea who killed him . This film also has one of the most entertaining heroes , Louis Salinger , because he is vulnerable . In most thrillers and action movies -LRB- and I am referring specifically to the Steven Seagal films , the Bond series , etc. -RRB- , we know that the hero is going to survive and that predictability takes some of the excitement away from those films . So it is very refreshing to see a movie where the hero could actually die , whether it is by poisoning , gunfire or some other means . Finally , Tom Tykwer has filmed one of the best action scenes in recent years at what is supposed to be the Guggenheim . The building , with its elegant circular structure , is ideal for a dramatic shoot-out between the hero and an unlikely ally on the one hand and the other bad guys , dressed conspicuously in leather jackets , on the other . Who cares whether it is implausible or not ? It is simply riveting to watch and reminds me of some of the scenes found in one of the better Alfred Hitchcock pictures . But the film is not perfect . Some of the scenes , for instance , are an obvious parody of the Kennedy assassination , which we have seen so many times before and we really do not need to see again . There are also some scenes that make little to no sense , especially the key one right at the end . But overall , The International is a great film and it has logic that those who are clever or just want to see something new can appreciate . " ,8
" our world sucks . In recent times , the major news in the world has consisted of war and banking scandals . While The International is mostly an action flick , it does focus on these topics . Like Syriana and Michael Clayton , the movie portrays a world of vile people , although this one has characters whom it 's easier to define as protagonists . The movie 's plot is that two agents -LRB- Clive Owen and Naomi Watts -RRB- investigate a major bank 's role in arms trading . In a quest that takes them to places as far apart as New York and Luxembourg \* and even Turkey , these two do everything to look into the bizarre conspiracy ... not without interference . But the overall point is that pretty much everyone in these sorts of affairs is , for lack of a better word , bad . And it 's a true representation of what we 've seen in the world during the past few years . All in all , this movie was no worse than I expected , no better than I expected . Worth seeing maybe once . Directed by Tom Tykwer -LRB- Run Lola Run -RRB- and also starring Armin Mueller-Stahl . \* We do n't often see Luxembourg in movies . Or hear about it at all . " ,7
" the most shocking scene is NOT at the Guggenheim . Finally ! A well written action-thriller , with a strong focus on the thriller part , rather than the action . It has a meticulously thought out script , so as not to bore the audience with mere action after action scene , each trying to impress us more . It 's misunderstood as primarily an action flick , which was done for US-marketing reasons only . This film is neither for the multiplex crowd nor for the right-wing conspiracy theorists seeking proof of a liberal-slanted Hollywood . Notice how the ultra rightwing press , the NYpost and the WSJ hates and trashes this film ! What else could they do , since the main villain is the a-s s that they kiss , the international banking system . Hence , the title seemingly refers to the International Bank of Business and Credit -LRB- IBBC -RRB- , but ultimately points to global financial infrastructure that has such a tight grip on the world that nothing will change really , about most wars , poverty , hunger and perhaps climate change . It becomes clear that it 's not a conscious conspiracy , but more a tangled web where DEBT rules the world . The bankers are as caught up in this too , and will all use the definitive cop-out : If I do n't profit from this war , someone else will . That is why , while the scene at the Guggenheim is definitely the eye-candy , the confrontation between Owen and Muehler-Stahl as ex-Stasi colonel , is the most shocking part . In this scene , where Owen asks Watts to leave , when he cross-examines Muehler-Stahl , the viewer is likely to think torture is used . No . It 's another example of the fact that torture is dysfunctional and unnecessary at best . Owen knows that Muehler-Stahl will co-operate because he 's looking for redemption . Commenters who complain that the film lacked action scenes are forgetting that Tywker is ultimately a European filmmaker : He can certainly do action , but it 's NOT his middle name . He knows that if sparingly used , it 's more effective . It 's also beautifully shot with compelling vistas of the Italian coast and the rooftops from Istanbul . " ,8
" Fine Suspense Thriller That Lives Up to Its Name -- Shot in Just About Every Major European Tourist Locale . Without knowing anything about who wrote this movie , I would venture that the seed of inspiration behind this finely wrought suspense thriller-drama was the late Enron Corporation . And it keeps the the viewer guessing as to not only who will get bumped off next but in which European city the next assassination will occur . Most of the cast is actually European , which I find a breath of fresh air to all the Die Hard sequels which always seem to be in Los Angeles . And of course , the film has become even more relevant with the global financial crisis of late 2008 early 2009 , which the filmmakers could not have foreseen . Unless they 're psychics . The central plot concerns the international financial system and how these large conglomerates make deals that may influence national defense systems , political movements , and even revolutionary coups . Not bad for a day 's work at the office . Clive Owen is convincing in his role as Louis Salinger , a disillusioned former investigator for Scotland Yard who has been probing an international banking\/financial leviathan called IBBC for about as long as it takes to earn a medical degree . He has now joined Interpol to continue his international stake-out . Owen has uncovered evidence that IBBC has been playing brokerage firm for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weaponry being sold to third-world-country revolutionaries , sort of Enron meets counter-insurgency . But every time he gets enough witnesses for his case , they end up snuffed out at the hands of an assassin whose personality would make Bill Gates seem more like Sean Connery . The film begins with one of Owen 's colleagues at Interpol being assassinated right after a meeting with an IBBC informant who also dies shortly thereafter . Being an IBBC informant or being in the vicinity of an IBBC informant is rather bad for your health . The game is on as Owen must become more creative to muster up evidence into the criminal workings of this international financial firm that would make Bank of America look like Toys R Us . And he must also keep his head above water as he follows strange leads and sift through conflicting evidence . And the chase moves from Germany to France to New York and somehow ends up in Turkey , living up to the title of this being a truly international movie . The only major American character is an agent , played by Naomi Watts in a performance that was satisfactory but not great . This movie is good but has a few flaws . Some of the assassinations seem somewhat improbable , but of course the baddies never seem to be able to get Owen . Another shortcoming is that the film reveals the baddies of the story about midway through . I think I would have preferred if the entire experience was through the eyes of Owen as his investigation leads him inside the workings of IBBC . Once the viewpoint turned to the upper echelon of IBBC , they seemed less mysterious somehow . Still , overall a good film , maybe not the best in the genre , but better than a lot of similar offerings in recent memory . And an outstanding performance by Owen keeps the pace constantly high . A few moments were highly suspenseful which I find much more satisfying than a lot of cars blowing up . The ending was a little sobering which I think was the point . Well done . " ,8
" more then just forgetful entertainment ! . well done , finally a Hollywood movie that takes on banking scandals head on . anyone at current with recent events involving the huge present day banking scandals will very likely enjoy this thriller . some reviewers wrote about anti-climaxing conclusion but i found just the opposite to be true . the ending is flawless in terms of how justice comes and goes around , too bad i can not say more on this without spoiling it ... Clive Owen remains one of my all times favorite actor and i think he was fit for this role 100 percent . after the rather poor scripted shoot them up debacle i am glad to see him back in his own on screen character . there have been many attempts in the media to play down the message sent here , which for obvious reasons and after i watched this feature , makes perfect sense from THEIR point of view . for once i liked the subliminal messages -LRB- from darth Vader toy , to the corporate PR hand-lings , and to the end message itself -RRB- this feature is not recommended for a viewer looking for action in classic sense , albeit there is a shooting sequence 2\/3 in that is extremely WELL DONE and very realistic at the same time . " ,10
" Really good political thriller -LRB- that means it 's does n't have a happy ending -RRB- . How can people averagely grade a movie like this is beyond me . I mean , no , it 's not beyond me , I just refuse to acknowledge that a movie is rated higher if it all ends well and the boy gets the girl . In this movie , ex Scotland Yard Louis Armstrong , now working for the Interpol , is trying to bring down a bank that is facilitating arms deals . At every step of the way he is thwarted by malice , incompetence , bureaucracy and bad luck . Witnesses die of mysterious heart attacks and car accidents , local authorities refuse to help or even do their best to hinder any investigation and so on . Even the next prime minister of Italy is assassinated and the blame thrown on the Red Brigade . So no , it is not a happy movie . The ending is even more realistic and shows in one swift swoop what the solution could be and what secondary -LRB- collateral -RRB- effects it would have . The actors play very well , Clive Owen was perfectly cast for the role , Armin Muehler-Stahl is doing a great calm role , filled with decency , as he always does , even the bad guys are very good . And it 's not that Naomi Watts played badly , but I felt that her role was starved of anything meaningful from the script up . Bottom line : it is a good movie , perfect for this economic climate . It makes you think , even for a small moment , above the meager modern human condition that dooms us to being just ants in a hill . But in the end , it also shows that this is all we can really be . " ,8
" Very Good Intellectuall thriller . The International has a lot of ups , and maybe only one or two downsides for me . It is an excellent movie with some very groundbreaking cinematography , a very good plot , and some surprisingly good acting . The high point for me in the whole movie , is the outstanding cinematography . I was n't expecting anything spectacular , but they pull off some amazing shots , that are brilliant . One shot in particular is an aerial overhead shot of thousands of people running away , and it looks amazing . Acting wise everyone does a pretty good job . Clive Owen is very intense and serious , Naomi Watts gives a surprisingly good American Accent , and the supporting cast is all very good . An interesting technique the director uses , is that he does n't put subtitles when characters speak a foreign language , and there is a translator . Instead he lets them speak , and has the translator translate it back . The only downside to the movie for me was that I did n't think the chemistry was great between Owen and Watts . Watts is a married mother , and Owen is a bachelor . I 'm not encouraging people get involved with each other when one 's married , but I feel that it would 've added more to the movie if there was more chemistry between them . The story is very well put together , and also very well written . My friend found it hard to follow at times , but I think that it made sense for him in the end . The story has one constant theme to it : If you never give up , Justice will be served . The movie stays very true to the theme , because throughout the story you think they 've caught the bank in a shady situation , but something happens to ruin their chances , and they must look somewhere else for a lead . It is full of action , which is very well done , and they add this interesting buzzing sound to the action , which adds a lot to the shot . This is a very well done movie that will entertain you a lot . 8\/10 " ,8
" Brilliant ... best film of the year ! . I saw the trailer and thought this might be a good film . However , trailers can be deceiving and so I knew well not to raise my hopes too high , even though Clive Owen , who is a brilliant actor , was in it . I was absolutely captivated by this excellent film - very much in the style of thrillers of the 50s and early 60s with a modern injection of action . The drama and suspense builds slowly and steadily helped by the background music , then explodes with a fire-fight in New York , -LRB- in our cinema it was just after the break - perfect timing -RRB- , and then takes a strange twist towards the end . This film will most likely appeal more to European audiences than American and may be found lacking by those seeking just a pure action film . But for others ... brilliant - best since a long time . " ,10
" Excellent tight thriller with no fat . All I can say is , this movie contains no clich s. It is reminiscent of `` The French Connection '' or the good hard-boiled cop dramas of the 1970 's . It is a movie that has no `` fat '' . I appreciate the fact that they did n't dumb this movie down or add idiotic slow motion shots of actors shooting two automatic weapons while sliding or doing flips in the air . I appreciate the serious and consistent tone of the picture . Good performances from the cast especially the nefarious German bankers and good pacing by Twyker make for an enjoyable film . The Guggenheim finale set-piece is a classic . Owen 's one-note performance is perfect for his role as an obsessed interpol agent . " ,9
" Stunning Transfer ; Decent Story . For those interested in how this looks in high-definition : this is , indeed , one of the best Blu-Ray transfers you 'll see at this point-and-time . I ca n't imagine it getting any sharper . Scene after scene left me amazed at the clarity of the picture . It makes this film fun to watch because the story is pretty good , about a C-plus if I was grading it . The visuals , though , make it a disc to own . What is spectacular is the scenery , some excellent close-ups and overhead shots , and one action scene in particular : a shootout at the Guggenheim Art Museum in New York City that will get your attention ! It reminded me of the dramatic shootout scene in the streets of Los Angeles in the 1995 movie Heat . This scene was just as intense . The sound of all the bullets - and there are hundreds in this scene - going from speaker-to-speaker was very cool , too . The acting here was good , led by Clive Owen and Armin Mueller-Stahl . I do n't think I 've found the latter to be anything less from riveting , no matter what film he 's in . The only flaw I saw was Naomi Watts looking out of place in this story . It would have been a more credible story with her role being filled by another tough guy like the one Owen played here . Whatever , if you want to see just how good a Blu-Ray transfer can look , while getting a decent story with exotic locales and interesting people , check this out . " ,8
" Mindlessly entertaining hokum . Clive Owen , who appears to be on a crusade to beef up his action credentials ever since taking the lead role in 2007s ludicrously violent Shoot 'em up , adds espionage skills to his leading-man repertoire in Tom Tykwer 's globe-trotting thriller The International . His face set in a permanent grimace , Owen plays Interpol agent Louis Salinger who is investigating the murky and potentially criminal activities of an investment bank run by Danish chief executive Jonas Skarssen -LRB- Ulrich Thomsen -RRB- . Accompanied by Naomi Watts , who plays New York 's assistant district attorney , Owen travels between Berlin , Milan , New York and Istanbul to uncover crucial evidence required to convict the nefarious banker for illicit arms-dealing . These urban environments are gorgeously shot by Tykwer , who successfully captures the unique feel and atmosphere of the different cities as well as the sterile coldness of modern corporate buildings . But whilst Tykwer has a good eye for framing the perfect take , he gets little out of his actors and the sub-standard performances jar against the beautifully shot landscapes . Owen , who appeared so versatile in his early roles , is becoming increasingly one-note and in this film he simply reads his lines with little emotion and commitment : even in the most intense action scenes , he appears barely more than mildly annoyed , let alone frightened . Watts is similarly unimpressive , and fails to add an ounce of character to her role . Admittedly , neither actor is helped by the clunky script , which forces the leads to deliver exposition instead of realistic dialogue and which includes such philosophical gems as `` sometimes you find your destiny on the road you took to avoid it '' . Where the film really falls down , however , is with the plot , which asks the audience to buy into the premise that bankers are frighteningly efficient criminal masterminds . In a year that has seen banking profits tumble and financial institutions collapse , it is simply too much to believe that a financier could orchestrate a civil war when it has become obvious that modern bankers can not even balance their own books . The International , with its fantastical plot , wastes what was an opportunity for a timely examination of the failings of modern finance . In an age when business news is hogging the headlines and people are becoming increasingly financially literate , the film offers only superficial insights into the corporate world , which was much better examined by Tony Gilroy in Michael Clayton . Taken simply as Saturday night hokum , however , The International is mindlessly enjoyable , and the exhilarating set-piece gunfight staged in New York 's Guggenheim Museum easily matches anything in the Bourne trilogy and is worth the ticket price alone . " ,4
" an excellent thriller that will be re-watched for years to come . I am shocked at the low average score given for this film . I watched ` The International ' again for the third time , but on this occasion in HI-DEF , and I thoroughly enjoyed it . I even said to my wife , I 'll go on IMDb later , I bet it got a high score , maybe 7.6 -8.0 , shocker , the average rating was in the mid 6 's . I realize that this is an ` old school ' thriller ; clever , attention to detail , good acting and it requires the viewer to have the gray cells working and up to speed . Sure you can watch this film and ` ZONE OUT ' , but it wont make much sense , as the film is driven by the story , not the action . Clive Owen puts on his character like an old leather pair of gloves , and is well supported by Naomi Watts . The story and plot reminded me of The Bourne Identity , because of the various beautiful cities from around the world , in which the many scenes were filmed . Always working together , and the country hoping never felt like it was done just to support the title of the film . Only five minutes into the film , and you can tell you are in for a real treat . If you like cleverly crafted thrillers , ` old school ' style , you wont be disappointed with ` the International ' . " ,8
" If you like detective mysteries , you will love this ! . I vaguely remember the trailers for this movie . I remember being interested at the action and wanted to watch something fun . Instead , I got something meaningful and a great-quality film . It starts out as a whodunnit and progresses into a story that demands change . It 's definitely not an action movie , but it has enough to keep the action lovers entertained . It has a really good pace and if you like mysteries , you will love this movie . Clive Owen does a good job as usual . Naomi Watts is also good . In hindsight , I think this movie is underrated here on IMDb . I really enjoyed the film and gave it a 9 , but I 'm surprised it received anything less than a 7.5 There was not a single point in which I was either bored or irritated with the movie . If you did n't watch it on big-screen , it 's worth more than a Red-Box ! " ,9
" IMO , Armin Mueller-Stahl has the best line in the movie ... . I tuned in on The International surfing the movie channels . I caught the last hour , maybe a little less . The photography was great . I thought the shoot-em-up in the museum was gratuitous . The European weapons exec who explained the meaning of global debt was a strong character . I hoped to see more of him . The time taken to destroy the museum could have been better spent developing the strong timely topics opened by the overall content of the piece . I was REALLY disappointed when the museum got trashed . Such events are too unusual and horrific to be as commonplace as such events are in contemporary movie-making . Trash the house , trash the school , trash the mall , trash the museum , trash the world . I was disappointed because the storyline had such great potential and the photography throughout the movie was so beautiful . I felt as tho I 'd been snookered into watching the same-ol-same-ol shoot 'em up just when I thought I was in for a real treat . I hung in and watched to the end mainly because of Armin Mueller-Stahl 's character . I was hooked when Mr. Stahl looked at Clive Owen during their one-on-one scene and said , Mr. Salinger , the difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to make sense . I hoped for more lines like that one but no cigar ! I 'm the one you burn was a slick ad-copy line . Nevertheless I will remember the truth-fiction scene and line for the rest of my life . As far as I 'm concerned -LRB- not far ! -RRB- Mr. Singer , Mr. Tykwer , Mr. Owen and Mr. Mueller-Stahl earned their paychecks for the whole movie in that one scene . Thanks for making The International and telling the truth about fiction . " ,7
" A little underestimated actionthriller . Recap : IBBC are a highly exclusive bank operating out of Luxembourg . But beneath the luxurious surface there is a dark and murky organization working in illegal weapons , overthrowing governments and controlling international conflicts . And it is brutal about removing any threats , interior or exterior both . Salinger out of Interpol and Whitmore of NY DA office has been on IBBC 's tail for long , and are finally getting close . But their agent , and their contact are both murdered , and it is evident that many national police organizations are influenced by IBBC . But Salinger and Whitmore are persistent , in a time when IBBC are just about to close an important weapons deal . They ca n't afford the distraction , and Salinger is suddenly a target . But in a world where anyone can be turned , can Salinger stop IBBC ? Comments : A very good thriller with plentiful of action , spearheaded by Cliwe Owen and Naomi Watts . The acting is good although what matters most , as always , is the story . Running at almost two hours , it does go about rather quickly . Set in places all over Europe , and New York , scenery and settings are always changing . What 's more important is that the story is always working , always developing a little , always taking a step in the right direction to keep interest . The bad guys are identified early , so there are no real surprises along the way . But do n't get the idea that you know what will happen , it might just not take the route you 're expecting . And that 's why it is worth to keep watching , that 's why it is very entertaining . Not to forget that there are some real nice shoot outs in there . Especially the scene at the Guggenheim are spectacular . And although the action is good , to me it only augmented the story . This is a crime thriller first and action second . It is really good at slowly building momentum , increasing the suspense step by step as it goes . Therefore it is disappointing that the end is so short and abrupt , something of an anticlimax if you like . It does fit the story , actually the end in one way confirms the entire movie , if you keep reading the headlines at the start of the credits . But I was hoping for more after the Guggenheim scene , or at least some sort of conclusion . Now it is not bad , but it was very open , almost leaving an opening for an sequel . In my opinion , this is a movie that would have benefited more from a real end . Still , even after a little low key end , leaving me wishing for a little more , I think it was a real good movie . But with a better end , it might have got one step higher on the rating . 7\/10 " ,7
" a nice throwback to an earlier type of spy film . Those in the market for a solid , old-fashioned spy thriller need look no further than The International , a movie that hearkens back , in tone and style , to those post-Bond Harry Palmer films -LRB- The Ipcress File , Funeral in Berlin -RRB- from the 1960s . Here , Clive Owen plays Louis Salinger , an Interpol agent who 's teamed up with Eleanor Whitman -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- , an assistant district attorney of the city of New York , to help bring down a major bank they suspect of brokering arms to terrorists . When one of his fellow agents is assassinated , Salinger sprints into action , even though , technically , he has no real authority to apprehend the bad guys . Complex , serious and swarming with red herrings , The International is one of those movies where they throw terms like file and dossier around with gleeful abandon - and we relish every minute of it . In addition , it comes replete with all the shady characters , covert encounters and glamorous international settings -LRB- Berlin , Lyon , Istanbul , etc. -RRB- we 've come to expect in our secret agent thrillers . Excellent action sequences , including a spectacular shootout at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan , add to the movie 's effectiveness . " ,7
" Breath of fresh air . The world we live in makes us rethink the things we took for granted . Who are the real gangsters ? The desperate , impoverished , uneducated who lash at the people not unlike themselves or the greedy , cruel , powerful paragons of respectability . We are all witnessing the crippling economic crisis caused by the uncontrollable want for more and more . This movie somewhat predicted the things to came . It took me by surprise that average rate for this excellent thriller was only 6.6 . As usual , the average movie viewer found the lack of neatly wrapped ending , depressing . Ergo he could n't award such a downer with the more appropriate rating . This strong , compelling movie is a breath of fresh air in the fetid waters of Hollywood movie-making . " ,9
" IQ : required . Heart : required . Bible : recommended . Watch The International . . First tip : this is much better than its ratings around here in IMDb . So for the record , if you have n't seen it yet , do n't be turned off by 6.6 \/ 10 . Go check it out first . Second tip : this review got some major spoilers . At the dawn of finally digging up bad deeds of a monster called IBBC -LRB- an international bank -RRB- , veteran interpol Louis Salinger had to witness his partner 's murder a few yards away , by a mysterious poison needle from nowhere . A few days later , their secret informer who wanted to contact interpol but got a cold feet also died in a car sinked to the bottom of a river . Datamining had been blocked by an invisible hand which seems to be manipulating all stakeholders . A prospective meeting had also ended up another political assassination . Salinger vowed to not to give up . Determined to bring justice to this infamous organization , Salinger teamed up with anyone who 's willing to help to follow the only lead -- the professional hit-man who slipped every time . When one of the shadowy conspirators was finally in Salinger 's interrogation room , will he accept the truth that there 's no way to simply bring down this enormous monster ? The international is a mind-bending movie . You definitely need your brain to follow the story as a load of tight events happened in 2 hours . The movie 's not about a lot of ambiguous , lame conversations implying who 's truly evil or righteous . The movie , in my opinion , is about interception and clashing of mindsets . Audiences , like the leading character , desire justice after they witness mayhem from time to time . Though totally anger-charged and compulsive at times , Salinger believed in interpol 's justice , that is , justice in procedure and result , that 's also the justice of pure black and white , with no gray area allowed . Gradully , Salinger got derailed from this while knight logic because as IBBC wrecks havocs , kills dozens of pedestrians every time he pushed the investigation , the marks on his soul , the deaths of friends , companions had broken him . Even the supporting local cop told him , do n't let them escape this time , or my partner would have died in vain . That is , as he takes this more and more personal , the story led everyone to a rule-bending conversation between Salinger and conspirator Wexler . In this conversation , Wexler told our hero that the world ca n't get rid of IBBC simply because every country needs it . The difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to make sense . Wexler told Salinger and us . Proactive thinkers may already got the message behind , that there are maybe hundreds of dirty corporations like IBBC in our reality , yet we do n't want to bring them down because they happen to be the ones that connects , vitalizes , wraps up the whole world . However , the crusader mindset of Salinger and drifter-in-the-sins mindset of Wexler had to make a compromise to prevent holocaust . And , they made this compromise . This essentially led to the introduction of another mindset not yet revealed -- the mafia mindset and its own justice and order . See , the mafia does n't pursue white knights ' vision of justice , yet they do n't give a crap about power balance which guys like Wexler would care about . They just deliver retribution in a surgery-efficient way . The movie 's climax had Salinger eavesdropping on a key conversation which supposedly could bring down IBBC 's core players , but who got faster than Salinger was the Italian hit-man , who Salinger had invited after he decided not to pursue the impossible mission and to go on with punishing key persons instead . The hit-man sent by Italian mafia wrapped up the situation by killing all the IBBC 's top management and said thank you to Salinger , leaving the later to use all the time he has wondering where is the true justice . Then the movie ends . If you noticed , the movie begins and ends with successful assassinations . OK , so far if you watched the movie the way I did , like I just showed you , you might be quite upset or depressed by now . However , you may also have noticed in my title of review I said Bible : recommended . That 's right . The clarity provided in Bible might be an answer , if you ca n't accept the answer The International gave you . We 've learned in the Bible that humans ' nature to sin is not only in every single person , but also in the whole human race . So , it is true we were born to a dirty world where we have come to find out nobody can be totally innocent just like everyone 's connection to the IBBC . Salinger 's mandate to eliminate injustice single-handedly is heroic , yet it 's not what Jesus tell his followers to do . In Jesus ' way , triumphing over injustice is to simply turn away from the worldly ways , and turn to Jesus , or stop hoping for what the world has to offer you and start believing Jesus and his way . Saint Paul said , count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Jesus Christ . -LRB- Romans 6:11 -RRB- Striving to find an ace in the hole from the world , Salinger found mafia and their way , their truth , and also their sins to bear . My suggestion for him , however , is to simply go with the legal procedure and face death , not with no fear , but with a determination to truly defy this sinful world 's rules and ready to go beyond .

" Money is war . In the midst of the financial meltdown , here comes a crime story that has a very unique culprit as its driving force , namely an international bank -LRB- whence its title ! -RRB- that has its tentacles in every bloody world conflict , which is in fact a sort of a semi-legitimate way for the global crime brotherhood to launder its money and , at the same time , to strike another business regardless of color of skin , religion , ideology or social stratum , where all of these ` reasons ` are only a fodder for the masses to be deceived through the mass media , while the business goes on smoothly . Or in the words of one of the protagonists This bank does not thrive on the conflict as such , it creates it , but then it thrives on the debt as the consequence of some senseless -LRB- African , yes , a colonel again appears ! -RRB- war , as it can never be repaid ! The acting is superb , suffice to say that this film has Mr C. Owen as the main hero , and films with him have so far been a real eye candy for me -LRB- see - Closer , Bourne Identity -RRB- , while the supporting cast is also on par -LRB- specially E.M. Stahl as a former Stasi agent now working as a lawyer for this hydra , N. Watts as a relentless FBI agent bent on blowing this whole affair up no matter what -RRB- , locales are to a great extent European , and every other camera trick so typical of Mr T.Tykwer is here -LRB- do not miss my favorite , namely , the showdown at the Guggenheim museum of Modern Art no less ! -RRB- . And to make the whole story even more conspiratorially real it is partly based on the shenanigans of an international bank named BCCI in the mid 80s " ,7
" An entertaining thriller for 2009 . . Some compare The International to James Bond and Jason Bourne films , but I 'd compare it to thrillers of yesterday like North by Northwest -LRB- 1959 -RRB- , and Three Days of the Condor -LRB- 1975 -RRB- . It has the same amount of tension though did . Not really intense action , but a good tension grabber . It does slow down in spots , but it picks up and grabs your interest . The story is about two Interpol agents -LRB- Clive Owen and Naomi Watts -RRB- , who are investigating a certain bank , that has accused of money laundering , making illegal deals . This bank has more power than the mafia , cause if anybody tried to expose this bank , they vanish without a trace . Can these two Interpol agents race against time to get evidence , before it 's too late . Clive Owen and Naomi Watts are pretty effective in there roles . Although entertaining , but do n't count on it being another Bond or Bourne . " ,8
" Just saw it great film ! . Just saw it great film . The International is about a bank which uses illegal methods for their investments . Resonates well with the audience after the banking crisis . Well written , directed and acted . One of Owens best performances to date . Watts had a strong supporting role . I would buy the blue ray for The International . I give the movie 8 dollars out of 10 . The movie makes me wonder what do the banks invest in which we have no idea about ? The ending of the movie asks these questions . Watch the ending credits . I would watch this film again . One of the best gun battles I have ever seen in a movie . The gun battle alone is worth the 8 $ . " ,8
" A Good Intense Thriller . . A thriller that will keep you seated . It 's said that money is the route of all problems and this intense thriller just goes on to show that . But everyone needs money to survive but unfortunately some misuse this to create problems . An Interpol agent 's partner is mysteriously killed after approaching a man , who he claims will be an informant who can assist in bringing down an International Financial institution , which is involved in purchase of Nuclear weapons and instigating coup in a third world country . Starring Clive Owen , Naomi Watts , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Ulrich Thomsen , this thriller genre movie is directed by Tom Tykwer and is written by Eric Singer . Its interesting to know what one is capable of doing when they have backing such as a financial institution to use money in whatever way they want and Tom Tykwer and the writer , Eric Singer , have portrayed this very well in this intense thriller . In the 1978 movie , `` The Wild Geese , which starred Roger Moore , Richard Burton and Richard Harris , Hardy Kruger , Stewart Granger and Jack Watson , a bunch of mercenaries are hired to over throw a dictator , who are supported by people with money . In this it is an Financial institution whose members will got to any length to stop investigation into its operations and this means hiring hit men to remove those who they consider to be a threat . A interesting concept , which takes one on a global spree and at the same time keeping the audience interested . This is a movie that is definitely worth watching . " ,9
" Pretty to look at \/ Bland taste . Tom Tykwer is one of my favorite filmmakers ... I know I am in a small camp of people who declare this . Having said that , The International , an exposition heavy conspiracy thriller , is Tykwer 's weakest film since 1997 's Wintersleepers ; it is his least personal and ethereal undertaking yet , not the sum of it 's parts , but even so it is still an arguably better film than most wide releases on the American Market right now . Starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts as well ... workaholics who happen to be a Interpol agent and DA who want to take down a naughty , naughty bank , Tykwer has assembled his usual crew and post collaborators ; cinematographer Frank Griebe , production designer Uli Hanisch and editor Hanne Bannefoy . This is a team that has worked together for years and they all have moments to shine under TT 's competent direction . Location work is superb , the film globe trots from Berlin to Milan , NYC to Istanbul . Griebe knows how to shoot bustling cityscapes , seaside vistas and temples , with an almost heavenly eye , while Bonnefoy helps string the image along with an undercurrent of paranoia , leading to a few wonderfully tense moments that do hearken back to the thrillers of the 70s . Hanisch manages to make a full scale replica of the Guggenheim for the film 's only action set piece . The set is a marvel to behold as is the action , a true sign that if Tykwer were given a better script he could hold his own with contemporaries such as the Scott brothers and Paul Greengrass . He 's also got a lick on the run and gun Hong Kong beat of the 80s . And so , Eric Warrner Singer 's script -LRB- surprise , surprise -RRB- is where the film flounders . There is that old film school saying - `` You ca n't make a great film out of a mediocre script '' - that is all too true here , with the themes and concerns of the piece being explained away in such generic expository metaphors as `` we 're slaves to debt '' or `` to get justice you have to go outside the system . '' While Singer certainly seems to get the procedures of international investigation right - at least in principle - he has left himself no time nor room to sculpt breathable dialog and characters you care about or at least find interesting . Outside of a few scenes , Singer ca n't figure out compelling plotting or pacing , leaving Tykwer and Bonnefoy to shape and tighten as much as they can as the script just begins to untangle from lack of focus and cheap , lazy story choices . Owen and Watts are good enough actors , as is their director , to carry their wafer thin agent and attorney through to the end , while Armen Mueller-Stahl also delivers his `` old world communist soldier under bank control '' with some low level melancholic gravitas , but none of it helps push a film that is trying to explore the twisted minutia of global business , illegal dealings and bureaucratic red tape out of a sodding , soulless place . Then again maybe making a film about such tricky gray areas with a clear message other than `` you lose '' is damn near impossible . Tykwer has wanted to do a conspiracy thriller along the lines of `` The Parallax View '' and `` Marathon Man '' for years , and while `` The International '' is relevant today with bank collapses , debts and third world conflicts rising , it is ironic how the man who made `` Run Lola Run '' , clearly an inspiration for Doug Liman 's first Bourne film , which launched us into the current globe trotting thriller phase , has ended up making a sub par wannabe . " ,7
" Pathetic story . I am a big fan of Tykwer , he could be the new Scorcese and so far I have not seen a bad flick starring Clive Owen . And yet , this movie is a complete let-down : a pathetic story about an obscure bank dealing in the arm trade -LRB- what is the surprise here or the story for a plot ? -RRB- , a useless female lead -LRB- Watts ' part could have been played by a large number of actresses -RRB- and a waste of Stahl 's talent . This movie is so deeply flawed , that the plot holes are the size of the Guggenheim museum . The final shootout in the before mentioned building is laughable and could have been directed much better with a director like Stallone at the helm . For a guy to direct movies like Run Lola Run and Winterland , The International is a complete waste of talent and money . And again : there is no plot . " ,1
" Just About As Good As Hot Cornbread With Butter And Honey . `` Frankly my dear , I do n't give a damn , '' about who wrote this new movie , The International , or who directed it , or who changed the lenses , et cetera . This excellent action , adventure and espionage thriller about a carnivorous cabal inside an international financial giant was worth the price of the ticket and then some . It was worth the time it takes to go back and see the film , having been turned away on the first try because The International was sold out !! It was that good . If you do n't like Clive Owen because he was in The Children of Men then you will probably like him in this clever mash-up . If you liked Clive Owen in the aforementioned apocalypticon then stick a high-voltage chocolate bar in your pantaloons and go see The International soonest . The cinematography is great . The pace is deliberate . The sound is very good and no dialog is lost to random machine noises , as there is not much talking in the amazing shoot-out sequence at the art museum . There is a legitimate criticism that has been made about this film , which is that Naomi Watts -- who is very talented and very beautiful -- does NOT have enough to do in a very mission-critical role . That is really just about all the criticism I have read , that I can agree with ... The plot is excellent . It is easy to follow even if it is highbrow . The story proceeds logically . No heavy lifting involved , mentally speaking , and most of the dots do get connected by the end of the show . Bankers handle money , money is about labor , and labor is about the work of our lives . If you can not grasp those connections then just be happy in knowing that The International is fun to watch . If you can grasp those connections , then you are going to enjoy this film just like a starving man enjoys a full plate of hot cornbread sopping with butter and honey . Cold milk for the drink is optional . " ,10
" interesting , but did n't completely pull me in . The International involves an investigation into a powerful bank that is doing many terrible things and will destroy anyone who gets in its way . I did n't find this totally convincing . Corporations do many terrible things , but normally they do n't instigate violence on a mass scale in first world countries , and this made the movie feel about as realistic as cop films in which mobsters blithely kill off large number of cops and politicians . But if you overlook that , this is a pretty good movie . The first half is essentially an investigative drama . Once again , there 's a little bit of clich involved in the way you 've got a couple of smart investigators determined to find the truth while being hamstrung by their bosses . But it is interesting to watch the investigation proceed . The second half of the movie is livelier , most notably in a big shootout at the Guggenheim Museum that is pretty entertaining . But while this was well done , I did n't connect strongly with the movie . The leads were professional but a bit bland , the story , as I 've said , seemed a little unrealistic , and the look was often a bit too monochromatic for me as so much of it took place in offices . I was torn between giving this a 6 or a 7 . I feel it is a 7 in quality , but I think in terms of enjoyment I 'm closer to 6 . " ,7
" A decent thriller , with exciting twists and turns . The plot is realistic and European actors -LRB- Owen and Watts , above all -RRB- provide the movie an additional value . Owen is good at depicting lonely tough gloomy heroes , having the ability to make mistakes and erroneous judgments -LRB- unlike main characters in B-category action movies -RRB- . The actions and activities take place in several continents and countries , and for me who has visited most of them was interesting to watch how intrigues and chases develop there . And there was a small predictability , you had to monitor the events closely - and some good guys get killed too ... Recommended to all fond of politico-financial thrillers with thought-provoking issues . It is no plain brawl movie with black-and-white topics and characters . " ,8
" Great Movie . It has a perfect balance of good action and sleuthing . Some people find the non action bits boring but if you actually engage with the movie you are sucked into it big time . The plot development is awesome . This is a great movie . It could have a little bit more action but other than that it is perfect . One of my favorite movies ever . The main actor does a great performance , The blonde woman 's acting is quite good but not perfect . I think this movie may be a bit intellectual , but not too much . I do n't know how this movie got such low stars , it seems a few people gave it very low reviews and this has dragged the rating down because it is not non-stop action . " ,10
" A movie which catches the spirit of the age . When I decided to watch The International I did n't have nearly any expectations . The foremost reasons why I decided to see it were Tom Tykwer and Clive Owen , who I both deem as somewhat remarkable persons within the film business , and I was interested in how good the result of their partnership would be . Except for this , my mind was free of any preoccupations and so I was curious what I 'd find in this movie . Here 's what I found : Personally I enjoy watching thriller\/crime movies , which go beyond the usual shoot them because it 's our job - mentality . And fortunately The International is not such a movie . The movie itself was not too action-packed , rather the amount of action scenes were well balanced . The whole plot is well-conceived and is not only far from being artificial , it even has a proper reason for such kind of story . Seeing how the whole financial crisis proceeds , nowadays people are pretty much upset with how our whole financial system works , a system which has developed a momentum of its own . A system , where moral values became less important than the value of money and power . War nowadays is n't only a bad thing anymore , for a very minor part of our civilization it has become a place of trading . Weapons in exchange of the lives of thousands of innocent people , just for the sake of the personal enrichment of a few persons . This is the first thing The International shows . The second thing is the involvement of the persons we 'd expect it the least from : The ones who represent our whole understanding of justice , who should protect our laws . The international networking of many western states makes it almost impossible to see behind the curtain . Everyone could be guilty in the nowadays politics , just like the movie shows . One negative aspect of this movie is the weak female main character . I would n't say Naomi Watts did a bad job but she did n't really impress me either . To be honest I think that she could 've been easily substituted by some other actress . Though I 'd like to mention that her rather weak appearance in The International is also due to the way her character has been described in the script . The movie does definitely catch the spirit of a time where people are about to lose their trust in the politics more and more . An age , where on the one hand a German government welcomes the Arab Spring , but on the other hand does sell tanks to Saudi-Arabia , who use it to quell riots in Yemen . The International is a remarkable movie , which is different to other thrillers and an outstanding performance of Clive Owen gives it a believable glance . " ,8
" Thoughtful , well-done thriller based on fact . This movie attempts to deal with the BCCI -LRB- Bank of Credit and Commerce International -RRB- scandal of 15 years ago , and does it well , IMHO . Clive Owen again , this time with Naomi Watts , directed by Tom Tykwer -LRB- Lola Rennt ! or Lola Runs ! -RRB- Tightly-wound thriller dealing with a corrupt bank spread all over the world , we go to Germany , Milan , New York , Turkey and a few other places along the way as the Interpol and NY state 's attorney investigators try to unravel an arms deal and the global power brokers who use world events to accumulate income streams from war debt , killing anyone who gets in their way . The movie uses architecture as a character , implying that IBBC -LRB- the International Bank of Business and Credit -RRB- is so monstrously huge to defy any attempt to straighten it out . They go to Volkswagen 's Autohaus in Wolfsburg and shoot there for the first time ever . -LRB- This is a massive theme park used to sell cars to Europeans , and is a location-rich environment . -RRB- Milan contrasts some of the older Mussolini-era fascist architecture with some of the new hyper-modern investment bank buildings . New York is seen as decrepit , old and worn out . Turkey is seen as ancient , predating and surviving all of modern man 's follies . The dialogue matches the locations , is smart , understated and elliptical . Reminds me a bit of Demon Lover for its focus on international intrigue , but it 's mainstream and taught , avoiding romance and titillation . Also moves like The Spy Game -LRB- Redford and Pitt -RRB- , pushing a very complex story through location changes and action . Direction and writing are spare , with much of the story implied or gestured so you have to figure out what 's going on . Acting is very good , and in a couple of scenes just spectacular . I actually watched this movie over and over again to try and untangle exactly what was going on . Even in the fourth viewing , it did n't disappoint . Rich diversity of characters . Many small parts are well acted and directed . Even the de rigeur big shootout at the end is so outrageous it 's OK . Yeah , it 's Hollywood , but a sudden teaming up of the bad guy and the good guy by necessity plus the bizarre location make it an amusement , kind of like Tykwer is saying , OK , you and I both know I have to do this here , but I 'm going to make it fun . The denouement that follows makes sitting through the action worth the wait . " ,8
" the action scenes are electrifying ... the story , not so much . But the picture does work out . The International is yet another example of the typical , all-nonsense action thrillers that seems to fill up our theaters these days . Although this one did not perform so well because of it being released during the dawn of the recession , it is very much like the others . It 's well-made on a technical standpoint and its action sequences are utterly commendable and electrifying . However , the story is not . Nevertheless , this is one of the few brainless , no-logic thrillers of the 21st century that I have enjoyed mostly because of some terrific performances and some really stunning shootouts . The plot is ridiculous , but suitable . Clive Owen plays quite well an Interpol agent who stumbles onto a trail leading to an international bank that is involved in the dealing of arms and explosives throughout the world and by himself tries to take the whole operation down , aided by a government official played by Naomi Watts . This is a harebrained and very problematic premise and the story does become a little jumbled and perhaps a bit confusing at times . This is not a picture where you can get up to get a snack , because you 'll probably miss something . And you most certainly ca n't pick it up in the middle or you 'll be lost . Unfortunately , that 's a fault . It 's one of the reasons why The International is only good and not great like the Jason Bourne movies . The movie just keeps throwing one outlandish idea after another and not only does it become disorientating , but actually , toward the end , a little boring . However , the film is saved by its performances and by its action sequences . Reportedly , the movie was due for an earlier release date , but was delayed so that more scenes could be filmed to transform it into more of an action movie and I am so thankful they did . Because the shootouts and chases are the best thing in the picture as the story and plot are harebrained and dull . So in the end , I am giving the movie a marginal recommendation . It is a decent enough spy-thriller , but not one I could watch every week . " ,7
" To much hype , not enough of a thriller tho ! . Clive Owen -LRB- Louis Salinger -RRB- an interpol agent is under suspicion that a highly accepted financial institution has been eliminating people because they have been under suspicion of international arms dealing . Heading to IBBC Headquarters in Luxembourg to catch them in a lie he gets no trace of lie out of them and gets a call from Naomi Watts -LRB- Eleanor Whitman -RRB- telling him there were traces of antioxidants in the body of his recent partners body . This film has the sort of political conspiracy sort of thing throughout . It never gets really to tense or thrilling until someone dies then everything comes out and they actually start to piece a puzzle together to unveil this conspiracy and who is involved . This movie also stars Armin Mueller-Stahl , Ulrich Thomsen , Brian F. O'Byrne , and Michel Voletti . With a not well plot out ending and the best scene being a shootout in the Gugenheim museum with the key witness , I was somewhat not so much intrigued , but ill let you take a gander and see if you liked the film more than I did . " ,7
" Like a Bourne movie only with too much reality . Clive Owen seems to gravitate toward dark , serious roles , e.g. Children of Men , The Croupier , both reviewed on these pages . You 're thinking , Hey , man , get a shave . And for heaven sakes , smile a little . In The International , Clive continues in the serious vein , and even though his character , Interpol investigator Louis Salinger , is planted in an uncaring morally gray world , the man is refreshingly passionate about right and wrong ... or at least about going after sneaky rich international-banking bastards who kill people to keep people from spilling the beans . ...

" A thriller with a problem of identity . What 's with all these meh movies in Peruvian theaters lately ? I know the situation 's not any better in the States -LRB- Beyonce 's The Obsessed in first place at the weekend box office ? What the hell ? -RRB- but come on . It 's almost May - this time last year we were watching Iron Man in theaters , right ? I actually wanted to watch The International - not because it had been receiving particularly great reviews , but because I 'm a fan of both Clive Owen and Naomi Watts . The former has been great in movies like Children of Men , Inside Man or Sin City . The latter ... well , she 's Naomi-friggin ' - Watts . She 's a great actress , period . And while The International is not a bad film - it 's a little more enjoyable than , for example , Death Defying Acts , which I also saw this week - it definitely disappointed me . The movie tells the story of Interpol Agent Louis Salinger -LRB- Clive Owen -RRB- , and her sidekick of sorts , New York assistant DA , Eleanor Whitman -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- , who become involved in a case regarding the International Bank for Business and Credit -LRB- IBBC -RRB- , which is organizing arms deals so they can control the debt of countries in Africa and the Middle East - nations involved in civil and border conflicts . Any time someone is about to expose the bank 's secrets , he or she mysteriously disappears or gets killed . When Salinger 's partner gets killed just after talking with one of the bank 's top dogs , both him and Whitman start to take the case even more seriously , even when their superiors starts being influenced by the very powerful IBBC . Even though The International is a meh movies , much like the aforementioned Death Defying Acts , it gets saved from falling into the depths of mediocrity by the performances of its lead actors . Owen is , as usual , excellent - grim , serious and believable . What I liked about his character - and the way Owen portrays Salinger - is that he 's no typical Hollywood cop superhero . He does n't run around killing bad guys and getting involved in fights . During the film 's most spectacular shootout , he behaves credibly , not like an invincible hero - he gets shot , misses , trips , characteristics that adds to the realism of the film and tension to the proceedings . Watts is also great - her character is weak , but she nevertheless does a good job at portraying her . Eleanor Whitman will definitely not be remembered as the most complex , powerful character she 's ever portrayed , but that does n't mean she is n't good as what she has to do . The funny thing about The International is that it 's by no means an action movie , but it sometimes wants to be one . The film focuses more on intrigue , suspense and tension - and yes , the movie can be really suspenseful and tense : take , for example , its opening scene - , but it inserts a couple of action sequences here and there . The Guggenheim shoot-out is superb - it 's amazingly shot , it 's violent , realistic and bloody , it 's tense and surprising , and it works greatly as an action sequence on its own right . But as part of the overall movie ... well , it is n't as successful . The same can be said about a rooftop chase sequence . Maybe this lack of cohesion also has to do with the undevelopment of the characters - Owen and Watts act like real professionals , but their characters are flat . To the director and the screenwriters , it seems , the turns and complexities of the plot they 're trying to tell are more important than the characters that get involved in it . The International is all right - but if you expect something really good , a compelling thriller that provides with three-dimensional , fully-developed characters , an even tone and a great screenplay , you wo n't get it here . As good as performances are , characters are weak , and the filmmakers ca n't seem to know if they want their movie to be an action thriller or a more intellectual , less visceral kind of movie . In the end , as uneven as The International is , I ca n't say I was n't entertained by it , more by its capacity to make the viewer think and guess about the plot and its twists and turns , than by its characters or action sequences . " ,7
" An intelligent thriller that is intellectually stimulating and highly entertaining . . The International directed by director Tom Tykwer best known for Run Lola Run -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , which was an excellent film directs this with the same panache . The plot consists of Interpol agent Louis Sallinger assisting the district court attorney 's office in New York , with one attorney in particularly Eleanor Whitman , -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- leading the case in investigating a bank the IBBC -LRB- the International Bank of Business and Credit -RRB- , which it 's executives and bankers are involved in organised and financial crime . Throughout we see Sallinger and Whitman try and bring the bank down with the assistance of various police officers in countries like Germany , Italy and America . The main strength of this film and the reason to see this is the story , it is very engaging and explores in great content the system of banking and capitalism and how some bankers in a high position of power will use it individualistically and collectively to achieve their own ends . It 's also something of an interest to me considering most films I 've seen deal with other types of criminals , never bankers , which makes this refreshing . It is also very topical in terms of being relevant to the times of 2009 and still now , with the credit crunch and stories of some bankers becoming receiving vast bonuses , which they did n't all deserve considering they were part of the reason for the economic instability globally . Another great strength is the script , which has sharp , intelligent dialogue and gives the film a professional tone coinciding with the story . The acting is excellent with Clive Owen and Naomi Watts though I was apprehensive about Owen 's dry and deep voice but he still manages to inject emotion into the role . Watts plays a role that is underused and I think has been underrated as she is terrific . Tykwer also directs with superb editing and shots . One thing that did let The International down from being a brilliant film and could have become a classic -LRB- hence the eight out of ten rating -RRB- is the lack of the external spectacle -LRB- action -RRB- . Looking back at the trailer , though it is short , Tykwer has made the error of showing the few action moments that are in there , which can lead to the audience being deliberately mislead into thinking this is an adrenaline action thriller . The first half hour of the film could have had a bit more pace in terms of some action , but it is still highly watchable . The one action sequence that it does have is a spectacularly choreographed shoot-out at the Guggenheim Museum , which had plenty of suspense and tension with some breathtaking stunts . I think this film is aimed more at a niche audience as it is quite intellectual . Even though I did n't understand everything about what the bankers were talking about , it was still interesting . Be warned as before this is n't an action thriller and if you want action it 's best to give this a miss . The International for me though was one of the best effort films of 2009 and is a nearly perfect thriller , which is well worth seeing if you want to engage the mind . " ,8
" Good but could have been much better . It was hard for me to rate this movie , but still think it 's a little bit underrated . Here I go with no spoilers ... Down Sides : Clive Owen who is much more than a promising adventure-movie actor is not very committed to the role . His grim and cool stance may easily be mistaken for a catatonia case . Maybe it can be justified by the hard days he 's been having but still , he could have done better ... if the screenplay allowed him . Same goes for Naomi Watts ... Yes , the screenplay omits the personal side of the the struggle . The psychology of going against all odds could have added much to the film . Also there are big and small logical defects in the script which , although I am not the kind of guy that enjoys finding them , I was disturbed to be distracted by so easily ... What is the real motive for the assassination , how can a bunch of guys with Uzis enter a public building with considerable security and why bother choosing that place for severing all ties with the consultant , why does no policemen come , why does Naomi Watts not look hot enough in this film ??? ... the list goes on . After all these years , I was looking forward to a better end in such a movie . A twist , a very good monologue etc. if not a total surprise . At the end I did not know if it was the end until I saw the credits . I wish I was 17 . Now the Up Sides : Clive Owen is still a good casting choice for this kind of story . The plot sums up almost all basics for this kind of dark-international-money laundering-government ending-conspiring story very successfully . It is a must see for fans of this kind . The dose of action is good ; it is not Die Hard , nor is it The Interpreter . The conversations explaining the way of the world are very good , with some gems to be remembered . " ,7
" Worth watching ... . Read others ' positive comments and reviews about the movie if you want more information about the movie itself ; I thought it was worth watching . I just wanted to mention that Colonel Wexler 's philosophical reflections about life and its twists and turns were rather thought-provoking . Plus there were also those memorable quotes early in the film from Calvini explaining the true nature of banking -LRB- see the Quotes section for those -RRB- . One pet peeve about the shootout in the Guggenheim - you would think that after taking successful cover from the assassins ' bullets behind the curving concrete wall of the museum 's spiral ramp walkway , that Salinger and the Consultant would crouch down behind this , running bent over the best they could , rather than run upright and present themselves as clear targets . Finally , one nitpick about the subtitling - it is principal , not principle when referring to a key individual . It was mistakenly used twice . Rent the movie - it 's worth it . " ,7
" A Nutshell Review : The International . The trailer had set up The International as some big-bang espionage thriller , made all the more sexier since it 's released in the middle of this financial meltdown we 're all experiencing , asking where have all the money gone , with banks collapsing left , right and center , or on the brink of doing so if tons of public funds are not injected into the rabbit hole of the system that has n't really bottomed out yet . But then again , watching or theorizing if the premise is remotely possible , since it involves a corrupt bank gone rogue in some misguided vision to make more profits , or to gain control of debt in third world economies , might not sit well with an audience already in doom and gloom , given some moral ambiguity all around , and the half-baked ending too . I have enjoyed a number of Clive Owen films , especially those that he 's the smarty-pants , able to whip up roadblocks for his adversary . It 's a departure for him here , and for fans I guess as well , with his Louis Salinger , an ex-Scotland Yard and current US Department of Justice agent , being quite the loser and always one step behind the bad guys . He can operate an Uzi , but needs more practice at a target range . Investigations wise , he 's as frustrated as anyone caught up in office politics and the drawing of jurisdictions , and has a shady past he 's not proud of . Which somehow adds to the credibility of the character . A super-agent would have spotted the assassin based on simple memory recollection , but here , he 's flawed , which makes him all the more believable . Naomi Watts too as his tag-team partner Eleanor Whitman seems more at home behind the office desk , though sad enough her character 's the proverbial Flower Vase , decorative and nice to look at , but offering nothing much in terms of character and story development , other than to cover the rear of Salinger in the office boardroom . Basically the film offered some thinking points , and makes you wonder if any large corporations , if without proper governance , could be susceptible to a moral rot from within , controlled by the few at the apex of the organization , making dubious decisions to proliferate arms and motivate political takeovers with coups and assassinations being but tools of the trade , and all these need money , which banks have loads of in their vaults . And bringing down banks is n't easy because of the multiple stakeholders being involved , from the humble depositors , to states and nations . In terms of production values , this Tom Tykwer film does n't scrimp , jet-setting the cast throughout Europe Italy , Luxembourg , Germany and Turkey in living up to its namesake . The musical score is also notable for its perfectly crafted tune to keep you at the edge of your seat , only for the narrative to fizzle out unfortunately . The International had an intriguing premise , but failed to live up to it . The ending too was a letdown , despite the realization that things must happen outside the established system , almost suggesting vigilantism , but alas something more pragmatic was presented , and running out of steam , the film just abruptly aborts itself . Too bad for local audiences as well , because we 've traded one intense shootout sequence at the famed Guggenheim Museum for the censored version to cater for a PG audience . Clive Owen movies got no respect these days by distributors here . " ,7
" A very entertaining film . I have liked the movies directed by Tom Tykwer pretty much.He won worldwide fame in 1998 with his frenetic movie Run Lola Run.And , although the rest of his career has gone a little bit unnoticed , I think he improved with every new movie -LRB- my favorite movies by him are Perfume : The Story of a Murderer and Heaven -RRB- . And although The International is one of his least obtained movies , I found it exciting and very entertaining.It can be alleged that a movie like this one , which shows the evilness of the international banks , came in the best moment , but I am not totally sure it is like that.One year ago , it would have been surprising to see the favorite product from banks is not money , but debts.The recent worldwide crisis has made that thing well known , so I think The International looses a little bit of impact ... although the movie compensates that with many positive elements.Although the movie has some jumps of logic and convenient coincidences , it offers enough doses of atmosphere and suspense to make of it a very entertaining experience.The International has some unexpected twists and the conviction from the actors on those scenes also helps.I also appreciated the dynamic development from the story.Tykwer made a good work as a director.The meditative moments never feel boring and the action sequences are well filmed and perfectly choreographed.I have to mention that the movie 's intention is not to be an action movie , but a methodical spy thriller which has some action scenes.Clive Owen has been doing very similar characters to the one he performs in this movie on recent years , but his development is always competent.Naomi Watts also brings a solid performance but , by my point of view , the best member of the cast is Armin Mueller-Stahl , an excellent character actor who has an impressing presence and style.His character in this movie is similar to the one he performed in Eastern Promises , but he shows a completely different personality in this movie , which is a sample of his great talent.I can recommend The International with confidence.As I said , it is one of Tykwer 's least obtained movies and it is not excellent , but I had a very good time watching this movie .

" Globe trotting thriller . . Intrigue and danger fill this thinking man 's thriller . Louis Salinger -LRB- Clive Owens -RRB- is an Interpol agent with a checkered past on a mission to discover and expose an arms dealing ring . He manages to find an ally in a pretty Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- ; the two find themselves deep and deeper in a secret world of corruption , greed and conspiracy . It seems a global bank with a stellar reputation , IBBC , is laundering money to assist terrorist groups and in the process of making a deal with China to supply weapons to military factions in the Middle East . Taking control of credit is taking over the seat of power . Things are n't exactly a cakewalk for Lou and Ellie ; IBBC is powerful enough to make police reports , court records and even investigators disappear . The plot at times gets a little murky ; but the action is not lacking . Very impressive settings and locations . The cast also includes : Armin Mueller-Stahl , Brian F. O'Byrne , Michael Voletti and Ulrich Thomsen . " ,7
" those who do n't get the ending ... here it is all spelled out . -LRB- heavy spoilers ! -RRB- . The whole ending of the movie is just as Ulrich Thomson 's character says , they will get another banker to follow though . The newspaper sequence in the credits displays that the bank elects a new chairman -LRB- Jay Villers ' character -RRB- , and goes on to make huge sums of money , and the final headline shows that all the efforts was just spinning wheels as they finally begin another investigation , just so it can start again . So all the killing the investigating , the efforts of the main characters and the motions gone though end up doing nothing to the bank . Just as the barely mentioned incident at Scotland yard from Clive Owens ' characters past , it was all rendered moot . The premise is that evil is eternal in the world of man . " ,8
" Excellent . . The International is a gripping espionage\/conspiracy thriller directed by German director Tom Tykwer who made Run Lola Run and Perfume . The first part of the film is deliberately paced with a slowly unfolding investigation but this slower pace makes the action scenes resonate all the more when they arrive , and we have seen enough to feel the characters peril . The movie has , for a thriller , quite a European sensibility and I wonder if some American audiences might take umbrage at it 's anti-capitalist stance or struggle with the relative lack of action , romance and humor . Clive Owen turns in a great performance as a driven , serious man and is complemented by good performances from the rest of the cast . If you like conspiracy\/spy movies or enjoy John Le Carre type novels you will really enjoy this movie " ,9
" Banks do n't die , they just get new people . -LRB- Synopsis -RRB- An Interpol investigator Louis Salinger -LRB- Clive Owen -RRB- is obsessed with linking the International Bank with dealing in arms sales to third world countries . He has been working with Manhattan assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- . They find that the International is the bank of choice for criminals and spy organizations with their money laundering activities . Following the money trail , they find that the bank 's illegal schemes help to destabilize small governments to a point where any new government owes their financial allegiance to the bank . Salinger and Whitman travel around the world trying to bring this evil bank to justice . Both are also being pressured from their bosses to shut the investigation down . However , they must be very careful , because the bank has a secret policy of eliminating any and all problems with someone ending up dead . -LRB- My Comment -RRB- The story was a bit slow in developing and will most likely bore some through the first part . This movie is very timely with the financial crisis we have today around the world , especially with our banks needing money from the U.S. Congress . It shows that the debt that foreign countries owe to banks make the banks very powerful in the political arena . Clive Owens and Naomi Watts did a fine job of playing their roles for this action thriller . The only problem is that Naomi 's character did not have enough screen time . There is one fantastic scene that has great shooting action taking place in the Guggenheim Museum . The problem with that scene is that I do n't believe the bank would have ordered it to happen that way , because they do n't want such an incident to be front page news . The roof-top chase in Istanbul was more realistic . Salinger does get closure at the end , but it is not complete , because corporations do n't ever die , they just get new people . -LRB- Columbia Pictures , Run Time 1:58 , Rated R -RRB- -LRB- 7\/10 -RRB- " ,7
" Actually thrilling . The film is basically well structured and makes audience concentrate on it . The level of tense is highly sustained throughout the film . In particular , the location at the Guggenheim Museum , New York is a must-see , and we must wonder how it was shot by making best use of its spiral passage . The ending was a little bit hollow , though . Clive Owen is cool and courageous as always -LRB- Yes , the next challenge of his should be a part of persons who are neither cool nor courageous -RRB- , but compared with all the past heroic parts , this part , Louis Salinger , becomes him . He well expresses the zeal to defeat the evil trading by an international bank . There must be a lot of people who are really working against the international organization crime like him . Armin Mueller-Stahl again shows us the tasteful presence . " ,8
" Best movie of 2009 so far . I really do n't understand IMDb users who enormously underrated this movie with overall rating under 7\/10 , and i also do n't understand professional critics who obviously did n't get this movie the way they should . First of all , ` The International ' is exciting and intense thriller with good story that is very believable and convincing , sometimes the story overcomes the action and it fairly complicates this film , which obviously did n't go in favor of most watchers , as it did n't go in my favor also , but it was no big thing , i got the main plot and that 's what this movie is all about . You have to appreciate the movies that are exciting and do n't allow you to take a break or anything like that , maybe ` The International ' was a bit slow on start , but once you get a hold of the story it keeps its edge until the very end . Acting was great , maybe two of the best actors in last couple of years Clive Owen and Naomi Watts were very convincing and persuasive . All in all , this is in my opinion the best movie of this year so far , and everyone who desires for a good thriller-action flick should go see it . 9\/10 " ,9
" Owen is worth any ticket , at any price , but , this film is merely very good , not great . Louis Salinger -LRB- Clive Owen -RRB- once worked for Scotland Yard . However , a witness in a crack case turned up dead and Salinger wound up with egg on his face . Now , working for Interpol , handsome Louis is sniffing out the details on some deaths linked to a gigantic bank in Luxembourg . It seems this bank has its fingers in several poisonous pies , such as the funding of revolutionary armies in Africa but , no one can prove this beyond a doubt . Helping Salinger in his quest is beautiful , Manhattan-dwelling agent Eleanor -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- . Eleanor has a husband and two young children but nevertheless runs with the big `` boys '' on their dangerous paths to bring the evildoers of the world to justice . From Milan to New York to Turkey , Louis and Ellie are pursuing their prey . But , will they succeed in defeating the powerful , the rich , and the ruthless ? This is a good film , near great , but , its complicated plot and understated realities result in something a bit wanting . However , the problem is not the cast . Owen is , as usual , wonderfully compelling , energetic and handsome beyond belief . Here is an actor with genuine star power and acting chops as well . Watts , too , is terrific as a female agent who , after `` playing '' the spy game comes home to a sedate life with her young family . Armin Mueller-Stahl , as a nefarious bank officer , is extremely fine and the rest of the players are very good , too . As one might expect , the scenery here is a prime reason , too , to buy a ticket , for the locales are wonderfully lovely and exotic . Then , too , a deadly shoot-em-up at the Guggenheim museum is fantastically executed . Costumes and production values are quite nice as well . The direction has plenty of energy , also , so it must fall to the script for any deficiencies in the final product . As stated before , the tale is a wee too muddled and ordinary to really set itself apart from other espionage winners , such as the Bourne Identity . However , if international intrigue is your favorite genre of film , this one can still set your pulse rate soaring . " ,7
" Go for the Shootout , Stay for the Rest . The International wo n't win any awards or be hailed generations from now as an influential force in the film industry . I know this intro is generally reserved for trashy popcorn flicks that are enjoyable despite what are perhaps glaring shortages of quality in one way or another , but that is not the case for The International . No , it was just a solid thriller with what may have been the best shootout since the finale of Hot Fuzz two years ago . While devoid of gun fu , I 'm sure John Woo -LRB- co-executive producer -RRB- was heavily involved in the making of the gun fight . People , even the normally non-expendable important characters , get shot . Walls become riddled with holes . Lots of glass gets shattered . I loved it . If you enjoy action at all , you should like it . But it 's not all the movie has to offer . Sure there 's the whole current events relevancy the ads have played up , but that 's not why anyone should really see the movie . The International is Tom Tykwer 's -LRB- Run Lola Run -RRB- take on the `` man on a mission '' story . We 've seen many variations of this , recent examples including an obsessed Jake Gyllenhaal in Zodiac to a noble Tom Cruise in Valkyrie to a driven Liam Neeson in Taken . This time Clive Owen takes the leading role , and he 's determined to take down that bank . I think Clive Owen gets a lot of unfair criticism . Some call him expressionless , but have these people seen him cry in Children of Men ? Have they seen his charm and charisma in what was by far the best part of The Pink Panther ? And so what if he sometimes takes a more minimalist acting approach ? It 's realistic , and realism brings believability and emotional investment . 2009 has been good so far . We 've had a lot of 2008 Oscar contenders released wide like Gran Torino , The Wrestler , and Frost\/Nixon . We 've had Liam Neeson kick ass and take names in Paris . We 've had the enthrallingly surreal Coraline . And now we have The International , perhaps not the best of the bunch , but a respectable an entertaining entry into 2009 's cinematic repertoire . " ,7
" Just think of what will happen when it 's One-World-Currency ... . Man , they were n't kidding with the title ` The International . ' All the way through the picture we were shot all over the globe . Heck , even in the first 20 minutes , I think we 're in ten different cities . Unfortunately , the pace of the movie did n't move as fast as the planes that carried everyone in what appeared to be minute-travel . Oh , and do n't be fooled by the trailer : by no means is this an action movie . It 's barely suspenseful . Sure , there was one very long shootout and Clive Owen runs a bit , but this has to be the slowest international spy movie I 've seen . And as for Owen , apparently he 's this movie 's Bond no one can ever kill him , despite the hundreds of opportunities , yet , he 's all but Jack Ryan , an analyst . It seems that we have this huge bank kills anyone who gets close to the truth of their evil scheme , but they 've apparently either underestimated this analyst or for plot 's sake , let him live for 2 + years of investigating . That 's a pretty big plot hole . I guess you 'll have to accept that . That , and why Owen or Watts , two wonderful actors , signed up for this , other than to cash their checks at the same kind of bank they 're battling in the film . I 've worked in the financial industry for going on 14 years now and this movie 's big-bad-bank set on world domination is n't really far from the truth . So , if anyone had any idea of trying to take down one of these , for moral reasons , or whatnot , good luck . You might as well try and overthrow the government or take on organized religion . It would be easier to build a dam with salt . Stick with ` Bourne ' or even the safe-bet ` Bond ' for more enjoyable globetrotting espionage thrillers . " ,2
" politics , war , corruption , etc , etc. . When I watched this film , I got ta say first , it was past midnight , I had to wake up early and I was tired . So , it means that I was not paying attention to all the details and the story . But overall , it 's a good movie . Not some crap action movie with bad shooting scenes . This one is intelligent , well made and has some meat around the bone -LRB- no idea if that expression is used in English ... -RRB- . For me , the key scene is the shooting scene in the hall with all the white floors in the middle of the film . That was awesome ! The level of violence we see in that part is so intense comparing to the rest of the film and I think that 's a good way to surprise the audience . And it works ! Definitely one of the best shooting scene ever . The rest of the film is good but I think that depends of the mood you are when you watch it . Actually you must be pretty awake if you want to follow what 's happening on the screen . Another good point , NAOMI WATTS !!! Beautiful actress and ... Am I the only one who noticed Francis Ford Coppola when they follow the guy in the street just before the shooting scene ???!!! Anyway , for fans of spy , thrillers , action movies but still with true story and lots of politics and stuff are gon na like it . " ,7
" intelligent well directed suspense action thriller . The International , starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts , is an action , suspense thriller that does a great job of keeping you glued to your seat without resorting to the usual shoot 'em up tactics -LRB- except for one scene in the museum -RRB- . The casting was great , the script was very well thought out , and Tom Tykwer does a great job in directing this film . The pensive viewer who looks behind the external plot will enjoy tuning into the emotional worlds of Agent Selinger -LRB- played by Clive Owen -RRB- and his partner for this case Assistant District Attorney Whitman -LRB- played by Naomi Watts -RRB- . Selinger is smart and motivated - he wants to bring down the world 's top white collar bad guys - but he 's really upset that higher powers are putting obstacles in his way at every step . Tykwer depicts Owen 's character Selinger as a tough guy with morals and emotions . Selinger is usually able to contain his rage and direct it towards action . His emotions are set to a low boil throughout most of the film but at one point Selinger gets so wound up he snaps and starts to strangle a young woman who accidentally bumps into him , thinking she is an assassin . Some critics have expressed disappointment with the role given to Naomi Watt 's character Whitman but I think that it was a fresh change to see a woman represented as one who embodies both strength and submission , logic and empathy . Tykwer deserves credit for daring in this day and age to portray a woman as one with gentle femininity , especially in a film of this genre . She complemented Selinger perfectly , he the dashing tough guy and she the pretty and supportive female . Their chemistry was superb , and my only complaint is that the script had her married and destroyed our chances of enjoying a romance that could have easily and naturally developed between them during the film . Tykwer teases us towards the end of the film as Whitman lovingly caresses Selinger 's face and runs her fingers down to his chest as they part . Two mainly irrelevant scenes that I enjoyed were in the museum where the assassin comments on how the painting depicts agony and the camera moves to the painting and we see the agonized face of a mother standing next to her dead child . Also I enjoyed the so stupid it made me laugh scene where Whitman and her boss have an fired up philosophical debate about truth . Superb film - 9\/10 " ,9
" Clive Owen , Corporate Skullduggery , A Brilliant Finale ! . This Evil Corporation vs Honest Interpol Thriller has a lot going for it -- Clive Owens menacing , broody good guy striving to maintain integrity in a dirty world , a good many flashy international locations , , each color-coded by the cinematographer , a literate . creepy turn by the excellent character actor Armin Mueller-Stahl , an insidiously effective music score that gets points not for bluster but for slinky underscoring , and as a high point , a kinetic , noisy , athletic , complex shootout in the circular confines of New York 's Guggenheim Museum . No , this dark conspiracy film has n't got constant violence and explosions , and no , it is n't always easy to follow , but yes , it 's an intelligent thriller with plenty going for it , consistently entertaining .

" Not as exciting as I thought , but at least it is n't dumb . . Released at the time America suffered from the economic recession , THE INTERNATIONAL , with its intriguing premise about the possibility that the bank is doing some dirty business with illegal arms dealings , is a pretty relevant thriller released at just the right time . It 's also well-crafted and handsomely-shot with a standout shootout sequence in the Guggenheim Museum that would have earned the late Alfred Hitchcock 's approval . However this otherwise well-crafted thriller suffers from uneven pacing , especially during the plodding midsection punctuated only by the said shootout sequence . Clive Owen plays Louis Salinger , a Interpol agent who has been part of an on-going investigation of IBBC -LRB- International Bank of Business and Credit -RRB- , an anagram of CBBI -LRB- Bank of Credit and Commerce International , real subtle ! -RRB- which suffered a real-life banking scandal during the late 80 's . They suspect that the successful banking institution may be part of illegal weapons trading , murder , and involvements with international terrorism . Salinger is partner with Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- , who is there and doing her best but never put to much good use . Most of the time , she 's even out of the picture when the action starts or in scene that advance the plot . The plot develops in such a way that Hitchcock would have loved : The investigation moves from Berlin to Milan , from New York to Istanbul , each with some standout moments and intriguing twists that heighten the suspense without having to be too dumb or preposterous . The Guggenheim sequence alone would have earned my approval , with it 's superb editing and brilliant photography . Had it been shot in VistaVision as a Hitchcock movie would have , it would have been complete . But director Tom Twyker also manages to make even the smaller moments of the film matter , like when Salinger reevaluates an assassination attempt or even a suspenseful moment when a shooter waits for a precise moment to take a shot . It 's a small moment , but Twyker had my pulse-pumping . Nevertheless , THE INTERNATIONAL is not free from its flaws . Although the movie is never truly boring or uninteresting , it 's neither as exciting or pulse-pounding . The middle act leading to an okay climax -LRB- a chase on the rooftops in Istanbul ; not bad but Hitchcock has done better -RRB- is marred by some heavy exposition that bogs down the excitement . As much as I find nothing wrong with a dialogue-driven thriller , trying to explain every detail of what 's going on loses much of thrill . Other than that , I 'd say THE INTERNATIONAL is well worth watching . In a time where a thriller can just be an endless barrage of shootouts and implausible twists , this is an intriguing thriller , even if it 's superb individual moments standout in an uneven whole . Rating : \*\*\* 1\/2 out of 5 . " ,7
" Not quite as bad as I expected ... . This film is about the banking industry and the measures they 'll go to to remain profitable . It does n't sound too promising for the outline of an action thriller , but believe me it 's a lot better than it may first seem . The film is set in various locations in both Europe and the US and this is reflected in the international cast assembled for this picture . Louis Salinger is an Interpol agent investigating the suspicious deals being done by the International Bank of Business Credit -LRB- IBBC -RRB- . He is working with New York District Attorney Eleanor Whitman , who is looking at the case because of suspicions that the New York branch may be involved . When Stalinger 's partner , Thomas Schumer , is killed shortly after making contact with an informant from the bank , the trail looks to be going cold . But Whitman persuades the informant 's widow to give them a name , Umberto Calvini , an arms manufacturer and political activist in Italy . They meet with him and he gives them information about the bank 's dealings and how they will use debt to stay rich . He goes to speak at a political rally and is assassinated . The bank still wants to do the deal , but now have to work with his sons , and time is running out . Eventually a new informant arrives on the scene , Wilhelm Wexler , who Salinger uses to bring about the inevitable end which I 'm not going to give away . That 's a very simplified version of events ; there are plenty of twists and turns in the plot to keep you amused . It 's a very well made film that was made in some quite exotic locations around Europe and New York . There are some very good fight sequences and stunt work ; in particular the gunfight in the Guggenheim Museum in New York is excellent . I particularly liked the performance of Armin Mueller-Stahl as Wilhelm Wexler ; he certainly has a lot of screen presence . Honourable mentions go to Clive Owen as Louis Salinger , Naomi Watts as Eleanor Whitman , Ulrich Thomsen as Jonas Skarssen , Brian F. O'Byrne as The Consultant , Michel Voletti as Viktor Haas and Patrick Baladi as Martin White . Over all it 's not a bad film , a little too long and a little over complicated in the plot department . Well shot with some great locations and some good action sequences . Adequate performances with , for me , Armin Mueller-Stahl being the star turn . It 's not great , but at the same time , it 's not too bad . Recommended for TV viewing on a wet Sunday afternoon . My score : 6.5 \/ 10 " ,7
" Easily forgettable , but still a pretty decent film . . I was pretty impressed with the opening of the film , expecting it to have somewhat the same style as Michael Clayton . It did for a while , then just proceeded to bore me . Luckily that did n't last long . The fantastic shootout in the museum midway through the film is the saving grace of this dull investigative thriller . But , then again , this film could have been simply amazing if they had just done little things differently . The scene that I had just described is as close to perfection as it gets . Overall , I 'd recommend this film ... if I could remember it . It 's plot and characters are n't exactly memorable , thus making this easily forgettable . That 's a true disappointment because this film had so much potential . I think it 's true flaw remains with the cardboard characters . If they had been fleshed out a little more , the story would have been a lot more interesting . However , Clive Owen and Naomi Watts do the best they can with the material they have . All in all , it 's not a bad film . It 's just not a very good one either . " ,7
" 800 Reviews capped with a decent thriller . Usually I have really tried to make each milestone of my reviews something significant . This is my 800th review and I kind of fell behind doing my reviews so I just have to plug through the ones I have seen . Anyways I hope everyone still likes reading my reviews and I will have to really come up with something spectacular . Email me with suggestions ? The International 's trailers looked decent enough but seemed like something I had seen before . Still the concept looked solid enough but I think I still had low expectations . Clive Owen for me is a hit and miss actor and the film looked like it could have been dangerously predictable . Finally I decided to check it out and perhaps in part to low expectations but also because of the smart style , good story , and intriguing plot , the film really surprised me !! The International turned out to be a thrilling , savvy , well done action thriller with lots of twists and turns but it all pulls together and is easy to follow . On top of all this the climatic gun fight in the Guggenheim Museum is worth seeing again and again . The gun fight is brutally explosive and wickedly cool . As I said Clive Owen is hit and miss for me . He never strays too far from the same character which is okay because usually he is suave and quick and makes a good solid dramatic action star and this is the kind of film he thrives in . Owen is terrific and he jumps from scene to scene flawlessly and he is the perfect hero against the evil bank . Naomi Watts plays Owen 's partner in trying to bring down the bank . Watts ' character is just really kind of there for the ride . She never gets to really come out of her shell and her characters feel rather empty unfortunately . I think that Watts has more talent than this , she certainly proved her chops for me in The Ring . Unfortunately this movie focuses on Owen and the bank more than her . There is n't even any romantic connection between Watts and Owen and this shows in their chemistry on screen . Armin Mueller-Stahl is dark and quiet and brilliant as one of the main people from the bank . Mueller-Stahl always has this evil eccentric look to him and he just fits in perfectly . This is only the second film from director Tom Tykwer I have seen . His first film I saw was the most strange film I have ever seen entitled Perfume . There is little to no comparison in style between the films but Tykwer definitely puts forth a gritty , dark , paranoid story to follow for fans . The twist at the end of the film both closes the story but really leaves it all hanging as well . Anyone wanting a really classy , stylish thriller will not be disappointed for one moment with The International . Check this one out and you might be surprised !! 8.5 \/ 10 " ,8
" Best Thriller of 2009 ! . The International is truly an excellent thriller . I entered the theater expecting a 7.5 \/ 10 - but it was way better than that . This movie is definitely 9\/10 . The advertisements were a total dis-service to the film - it was quite a bit better than what I expected based on the advertisements . This movie may have gotten a 6.9 \/ 10 and the ads do n't make the movie look promising - but I totally recommend everyone who loves action\/thriller movies to watch this . From the very first minute of this movie - it was thrilling , suspenseful and exciting . The actors were chosen perfectly and suited the characters excellently , and the camera work was also spectacular . This film is basically about a large bank that controls so much and is using its money for illegal things . The main character - Louis Salinger - is trying to stop this bank . There is plenty of action and thrills throughout this movie and it is truly enjoyable to watch . Simply terrific . " ,9
" Pay very close attention ... . ... because if you blink , you might just miss something important . The International , the latest offering by director Tom Tykwer , is nothing short of great and is definitely hugely , HUGELY entertaining . From the very beginning to the end , I was floored . Kudos to Tykwer for presenting us delicious shots and angles with brisk editing , gripping and focused direction that gives the film an excellent visual style , and the excellent , excellent music score by Reinhold Heil , Jonny Klimek , and director Tykwer himself , that really sets the whole mood for the film as it is not cheesy , grand or overblown - it is merely filled with tension . Accompanying these techniques is the gorgeous cinematography of various European locales , not to mention New York City . A special mention goes to the film 's lone action sequence . Yes , there is only one action scene , but believe me , it will stay in your mind for quite some time . It 's a shootout that takes place in the Guggenheim Museum in New York , and it is absolutely breathtaking to watch . This is Tykwer 's film , no doubt . Plot wise , the script almost , ALMOST opts for the easy way out , but jumps right back into reality . Granted , it 's more like a conspiracy thriller rather than a shoot-em-up action movie as mis-marketed by the film 's trailer -LRB- which , sadly was the reason why many people did not like the movie -RRB- . The script has it 's flaws , but I did not notice them as I was fully gripped with the main premise . Evil bank organization . I wo n't give any more , because it 's too complicated from then onward . Because , when you watch this movie , it is ideal to pay very , VERY close attention to the screen with absolutely no distractions whatsoever . Otherwise , you will spend the rest of the movie scratching your head in disbelief . This movie is intelligent , very intelligent . Also , when you leave the theater , the film will give you something to think about . I mean , the recent economic recession caused by a scandal . More third-world countries erupting into violence . Mere coincidences ? Acting wise , it 's solid , but does not do much . Owen here is again flexing his action hero persona , but with more grit than charm . He gives a believable performance . Naomi Watts , although her acting is good , is a major flaw in the film - her character is wasted and has very little screen time compared to others . The real standout here is Armin Mueller-Stahl , who steals the show as one of the bank 's officials . Granted , this is NOT the usual Hollywood popcorn flick , this movie needs to be watched and appreciated , and if possible , make people think . A quick warning though , this film has a nearly abrupt ending , but an explanation earlier in the movie helps resolve it . This film is worth your money and time , and I recommend to see it with some of your intelligent friends . This is an excellent film , no doubt one of the year 's very best . Instead of wasting your time and money on the kiddie-like Witch Mountain and that God-forsaken Dragonball , see this movie . Or better yet , to satisfy the kids drop them off at these two movies , and take your other to see this movie . It 's hugely and criminally underrated , and should be appreciated more . Overall : 9\/10 P.S. : I went to a midnight screening of the movie . The next day I woke up and the first thing I saw on the news were some people rioting outside the RBS -LRB- is it ? -RRB- in London , and more banks and markets start to tumble from there onwards . Coincidence is highly unlikely , but it 's definitely creepy when you think about it . And I 'll think about this film for some time . " ,7
" Competent conspiracy thriller . The International is an efficiently put together international conspiracy thriller , in which Interpol agent Clive Owen and Manhattan DA Naomi Watts try to discover what is going on at an international bank where people seem to end up dead rather too frequently . The plot is convoluted but followable . It develops in unexpected directions , none of which are unreasonable . In story terms , it 's a good satisfying meal . There are a number of eye-catching urban locations , enough to give the movie the international feeling its title demands . There is surprisingly little action as such , although there is one exciting sequence in New York 's Guggenheim Museum . There are a handful of moments where you go , `` Surely the police would be there by now ? Surely he would n't just wander around carrying a pistol and no-one would react ? Surely he would n't take that bullet-proof vest off while the shoot-out is still going on ? '' Owen , who I have often thought as oak made flesh , is finally developing into a tolerable actor . He has zero chemistry with Naomi Watts , and I was very happy with that because they were n't meant to . It 's refreshing to have male and female leads who are n't required to develop a romantic interaction , and where the job they are doing defines the relationship between them . I enjoyed this , and felt it was well worth a couple of hours of my time . " ,8
" Fabulous . `` Sometimes you find your destiny on the road you took to avoid it . '' - Louis Salinger Art imitates life in the tight thriller The International by talented director Tom Tykwer -LRB- Perfume : The Story of a Murderer , Paris , je t ` aime -RRB- . An original screenplay by screenwriter Eric Singer , the title refers to the International Bank of Business and Credit -LRB- IBBC -RRB- , a mighty global bank involved in illicit activities and corruption , purportedly patterned after real corporations , the Permindex Trade Organization of Canada and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International of Pakistan . Louis Salinger -LRB- Clive Owen -RRB- is a scruffy Interpol guy whose partner gets killed in the middle of their investigation of the IBBC . He gets help from his American counterpart Eleanor Whitman -LRB- Naomi Watts -RRB- , who allows him to get as close to the truth as possible , putting her own life on the line . The pair jetset all over the world in pursuit of characters who could help them take down the impenetrable IBBC . But the truth gets more difficult to swallow when they realize how deeply infected the whole system has already become , threatening to take not just the guilty down . Tykwer employs his trademark crisp visuals to tell what could have been a very complicated story really well . Owen 's performance is just right , and while Watts ' is , too , I could n't help but be distracted by how young and fresh she looked to be playing her character . The rest of the supporting cast deliver the chills , and so do the memorable action sequences , particularly the one in the Guggenheim Museum and the piazza in Milan . " ,8
" The ultimate thriller . What a movie ! It has your attention caught from the very first scene of Clive Oven standing in the rain , watching . And pretty soon you get enveloped in the net of shocking mystery and conspiracy the main antagonist - an international bank - produces . First of all , the whole premise of a story is based on real life events and you might even learn from this film about the power these banks have over ordinary individuals , or even whole nations . Secondly , you get to see extremely entertaining spectacles of high-profile assassination and its investigation , followed by the Guggenheim part , which is , without doubt , one of the most memorable , enjoyable and realistic shoot-outs I 've ever seen in a movie . Wonderfully orchestrated , brilliantly shot and with breathtaking special effects and stunts ! And then there 's agent Louis Salinger , who has his own personal vendetta against the bank . After having suffered many painful losses during his previous investigations , he tries to protect Naomi Watts ' -LRB- She 's more beautiful than ever -RRB- character and family from the imminent danger of death the case brings while at the same time fully submerging and devoting himself to solve it . A recurring element of tingling in his ears plays wonderfully as it portrays his helplessness . Just as he lay there , on the pavement , watching a friend die with no power to turn the time back and save him , so did at the very last scene of the movie the comprehension of his vain little role trying to stop the grand scheme of endless international affairs dawned on him . You stopped this banker ? There are hundreds of others just like him , waiting to take his place . To me this was a perfect ending to an ultimate thriller . " ,10
" Do n't bother . . Me and a friend sat down to watch this movie last night , I hardly know where to start ... I kept looking on my watch to see how far we were in , and how long it would drag on . Clive Owen made it so terribly monotone , the end of the movie could n't come fast enough for me . It offered nothing new , nothing surprising , there was not one moment where I thought ` Wow ! that 's original ' ! There was no bonding with the characters at all , nor were they likable enough to Not need a background story . We kept on guessing the movie would show what ` it got ' in the next 5 minutes , and we kept repeating that to ourselves every 5 minutes , but when the movie ended it still had not happened . To me it was a big let down . I was tricked into seeing it after seeing the positive rating on IMDb , and the positive comments , so I guess enough people like this kinda movies . Just if you 're more into a fast paced stories , I suggest you skip this movie . " ,1
" Internationally Unappealing . The International stars Clive Owen as Louis Salinger , an Interpol agent with a blemished service record . After a colleague is murdered in an attempt to investigate a powerful bank 's role in the sale of illegal arms , Salinger embarks on a crusade to expose everyone involved . Naomi Watts is in this too -LRB- as an NYC District Attorney -RRB- , but mostly she cries , looks longingly at her Blackberry , and stands in the way of moving cars . There 's a lot of other stuff involved in the plot , but trying to hash it all out is a headache that 's not worth the payoff . Fairly obscure characters are referenced as if we should instantly know who they are , and there 's a lot of discussion regardinginternational legal policy , the indestructible banking system and how we 're all reliant on it , and how the only way to implement any real change is to act outside the law . While some of this may be true -LRB- and thought-provoking in its own right -RRB- , the way it 's presented is numbingly boring , and it 's done by way of tidbits of dialogue that are n't explored or revisited with any depth . As the plot hurls us from one exotic location to the other , we 're left trying to connect the dots , scrambling to remember who said what when and why it was important . In that sense , The International suffers a fate that many thrillers steeped in international politics\/intrigue seem to fall victim to an unnecessarily convoluted plot that feels like a clich and is n't interesting . Aside from a prolonged shootout at the Guggenheim which , I might add , provides ample opportunity for us to revel in the satisfaction of watching pretentious piece after pretentious piece of modern art -LRB- in the form of glass panels with images being projected on them -RRB- get totally anniahlated there 's not much here to warrant a rental . Some may suggest that there is a theme of redemption working as an undercurrent in The International , but who cares ? There 's almost no characterization , so we do n't have anything invested in any of the players . And it 's so tedious that by the time you 've reached the startlingly blunt climax you wo n't want to waste a second pondering the film 's messages , whether they 're personal , global , or present at all . When there are other well-made political thrillers out there such as State of Play , which should be making its way to DVD\/Blu-ray in the very near future I 'm not sure why anyone would devote a movie night to The International . I can say , however , that the previews reminded me that I need to pick up Close Encounters of the Third Kind in hi-def ASAP . " ,3
" You 'll wonder why you 're watching it . On paper , THE INTERNATIONAL must have ticked all the right boxes : a timely action-thriller in which banks are the bad guys , blending BOURNE-style action with conspiracy chills and high-tech interplay . Sadly , the end result is , if not disastrous , then highly disappointing , purely because it turns out to have no heart . There 's no emotional investment in this film whatsoever . Clive Owen 's bland investigator fails to elicit any sympathy from the viewer as the story progresses , and the rest of the cast are similarly cold and emotion-free ; it 's as if the movie 's populated by those automatons out of SURROGATES instead of real people . One of the worst involved is Naomi Watts , who 's the poorest I 've seen her ; it does n't help that her character , despite occupying a central role in the film and lots of screen time , is completely and utterly extraneous . Director Tom Tykwer creates a well-shot movie that looks visually impressive , and handles at least one better-than-average action sequence , an elaborate shoot-out that really works . Sadly , the rest of this enterprise fails to draw in the viewer in any sense , and it feels more like a clinical exercise than a real , involved movie . " ,4
" A Tad Weak . The International tries very hard to come across as an intelligent and sophisticated thriller , but very soon it 's obvious that it 's trying too hard -- and failing . You see every plot twist -LRB- read clich -RRB- coming miles before it arrives , and there is no suspense whatsoever . Clive Owen 's character is weak and ineffectual , Naomi Watts ' is utterly predictable and plodding . At no point are we given any reason to care about any of the characters , nor do any of them seem to care about each other . The big shootout is mildly entertaining but no more than that . Just like everywhere else in the movie , Salinger fails to do anything competent or unexpected . Even the scene where Salinger decides to become a fugitive to achieve justice is devoid of emotion -- the actors recite their lines tiredly , without any conviction or feeling . When we finally get to the ending , we get that tired old clich of the hero being too morally unsure or weak to carry out his mission , and the film 's final act is concluded by deus ex machina . As another reviewer pointed out , Salinger fails to even bring about the financial collapse of the bank , something which was easily within his grasp -LRB- or would have been if he was remotely competent -RRB- . This movie was disappointing through and through . " ,3
" Guggenheim scene is the only part worth watching . This is a conspiracy filled action thriller involving problems with banks and bankers , released in 2009 during the break down of American banks , causing the world wide recession . The film is as dull as what the politics behind the recession really are . I can imagine it involves people sitting in a room talking about things I am really not interested in . Well I do n't have to imagine anymore because I have just watched a two hour version of something that is very uninteresting . Clive Owen is Interpol Agent Louis Salinger , teaming up with District Attorney Eleanor Whitman -LRB- Watts -RRB- . They are investigating the conspiracy involved within the IBBC -LRB- International Bank of Business and Credit -RRB- , headed by Jonas Skarssen -LRB- Thomsen -RRB- . They are selling weapons to countries either side of a potential war in the hope that it will cause conflict and ultimately they can control the debt riding high between the two countries . Control the debt , control the war , control the country . Salinger and Whitman believe that this is going on but must attempt to prove it and find themselves traveling from Berlin to Milan to New York to Istanbul to do it . The film opens with Salinger 's partner being killed during an interview with a potential mole in Berlin . Once he discovers who the meeting was with , Salinger travels to Italy to speak with a politician who is also an weapons manufacturer potentially selling his weaponry to the bank . Once he is killed by an assassin from IBBC , Salinger follows the lead to New York , where he partakes in a giant shoot out inside the Guggenheim Museum -LRB- a brilliantly shot piece of cinema -RRB- . By spying on the assassin he manages to bring in the investigator from the bank , which then leads him to Turkey where he can finally confront the head of the entire organization , who seems to have no remorse for his actions . This part is very contrived . A huge problem with the film for me is exactly what I have just explained above . The film jumps around from location to location as if it is the only way to keep the film exciting . They travel but end up sitting in an office talking to one another . By half way through I was bored of all this and wanted something to spring the film into life . Finally we had the bit that I had been waiting for since the trailers . The brilliant shoot out inside the Guggenheim Museum . I 'm telling you now this is the only reason to see this movie . The shooting of it is brilliant , the direction and the effects are great and the camera work , spinning like the floors of the museum , makes you dizzy and within the action . This fifteen minute segment is the only good thing about this film and is possibly the reason Clive Owen agreed to do it . It must be the only reason that he chose to do it because his lack of enthusiasm within the role is obvious . He brings nothing new or exciting to the role and his character has nothing about him . He did n't interest me with no back story or relationships or any real reason for his actions . His lines towards the end also came from a poetry book and became very clich d. He is just a one dimensional character and is n't likable . Clive Owen may have done the film due to the museum scene , hell I would have done it for that scene , but I do n't understand why Naomi Watts agreed to be in this film . Her character is completely underused and only pops up in a few talky scenes , where she brings nothing to the scene at all . She also brings nothing to the character either , as if half way through she realized this film is not good for her and she gave up . The acting and script are poor , and the dialogue is far too expositional at times . The best bit of the film is that shoot out and I keep referring to it as it is the only thing that I really enjoyed about it . Bullets fly around the spiral floors as each set of shooters run counter clockwise from one another . Blood splatters , glass flies , it really is an entertaining sequence , even more so knowing that it was done on a sound stage , but it has very little relevance to the film . It is as if the writer put this scene in to make sure the film was n't boring because without it , it really would be . I do n't know why it was in the Guggenheim and why it was so overblown as they could have taken each other out silently on route to the museum . The film just seems very set up . It is obvious actors have been placed and dialogue is used to explain too much . It does n't flow and does n't feel like a world we can delve into . I was hoping for a little more especially from the trailers action packed activities . If it was n't for the Guggenheim this film would be terrible so thank God Tykwer decided to put it in . 1.5 \/ 5 For more reviews : www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com " ,3
" Blood , guts and vocal range . There are two ways in which a movie can succeed . One it can have a fully realized plot that works to explain some larger subtextual moral . It can demonstrate a mastery of technical and thematic areas and create an emotional response in the viewer . This is the route that most critics look for when giving a positive review . Films like Schindler 's List . On the Waterfront . A Streetcar Named Desire . The other way in which a movie can succeed is with ideas . This type of movie does n't have to make sense in the same way that a traditional film does . It simply has to take you somewhere you have never been , and hopefully throw your mind through a few loops along the way . Films like El Topo . The Fountain . Eraserhead . Gummo . The Exterminating Angels . Repo ! The Genetic Opera definitely falls into the latter category . The story , told entirely through song , details the intersecting secrets of people living in a world where a mysterious virus has caused random organ failure and forced people to resort to leasing cloned organs , at a very high price . There is so much whimsy in this film that it almost becomes an absurdist fairytale . It skips and jumps from one homage to the next , cribbing notes from Rocky Horror in one scene before moving on to Rigoletto in the next . Genres and archetypes are thrown up against one another and mashed together with reckless abandon mixing Grand Guignol with Sondheim and Disney with Faces of Death . It cuts together the pieces of our collective pop culture consciousness the same way that the antagonists cut together new forms for their bodies . And it 's wickedly funny too . Picking up where the ultimate consumers of Romero 's shopping malls left off , Repo ! makes for a brutal satire of consumer culture where human flesh is a commodity bought and sold with government approval . People have designer spines and get upgrades on their bodies when they go in for maintenance on their artificial organs . Starlets do n't forget to wear panties , they forget to sew on their new faces . Darren Lynn Bousman has made a name for himself as a go-to guy for over the top , operatic gore and he does n't shy away from it here . Repo ! is often tremendously bloody with sanguine spilling left and right , often directly on top of naked flesh . He takes what he learned making Saw II -- IV and pushes in into overdrive as he uses it to skewer one satirical target after the next . Normally I am one to shy away from sexualized violence . I find it repulsive and saddening , but here , Bousman has found that perfect mix between sexy and grotesque . Though the bloodletting is vicious , it never spills over into elaborate rape fantasy . It is a shame that he is no longer attached to the Hellraiser relaunch . The cast , made up of a bizarre collection of geek favorites , musicians and world famous opera singers is almost weirder than the movie 's central conceit . Paul Sorvino is brilliant fun as the patriarch who controls the world but finds himself unable to defeat cancer . Sorvino is fascinating to watch when he is let loose and he has a singing voice to rival any star of stage . Sarah Brightman is also quite good in a small roll that is entirely divorced from her signature turn in Phantom of the Opera . The rest of the cast is a bit of a mixed bag . Alexa Vega is strong as the cloistered daughter of the eponymous organ ripper and Anthony Stewart Head outdoes his Buffy singing , even as his role is too close to that of Giles . Meanwhile Bill Mosely is obnoxious and all over the place , playing his seventh version of Chop-top while Paris Hilton is actually shockingly watchable as Amber Sweet , a heightened reality version of herself . But the real standout is Nivek Ogre of Skinny Puppy . The man steals the show as a deformed lothario who has a nasty habit of killing his lovers . At a point , the film becomes as scattershot as the cast list with some moments hitting it out of the park while others miss wildly . By the end of the film one would be hard pressed to explain how the characters all end up in the same place , but it has long since ceased to matter because you 've either accepted that the film is fairly divorced from reality , or else , you 've walked out of the theater . I stayed , and loved every minute of it . When I see a movie like this , I want to be taken to a new world . Somewhere strange and alien . The futuristic retro-chic of the Repo 's alternate dimension is vibrant and dazzling , it 's a whirling dervish of colors and styles . And though it never comes together , the overwhelming strangeness of it is intoxicating . The music is not for everyone , and the bloodletting is extreme , but Repo ! offers something rarely seen at the multiplex -- originality .

" Repo the Genetic Opera is a breath of fresh air in a stale world of Horror movie copy cats . We just got from seeing the Repo premiere and now I ca n't wait until November to see it again . The film was phenomenal ! It was beautiful to watch and extremely entertaining . Repo far surpasses the Saw films in originality , creativity , and artistic integrity . This is not simply a slasher film , although there is plenty of violence to keep gore fans happy , there is a very interesting and unique story being told here . In fact , a whole world has been created in Repo and there is plenty of room for more stories to follow . Unlike many sequels , a sequel to Repo would be completely justified in respect to its content . The music was catchy and I walked back to the hotel with it running through my head . There is a nice variety of songs featured in Repo and , as is natural with a collection of songs , fans will have their favorites and their least favorites . I can honestly say that even my least favorite songs were still necessary in the context of the film and I did n't really mind them . I was slightly caught off guard by how pop a couple of the musical numbers were , but again they were appropriate for the part of the film they were featured in . Another surprise was the size of roles in the film . The roles played by Ogre , Bill Moseley , and Paris Hilton were not as prominent as I had imagined them being -LRB- and yes Paris gave a good performance -RRB- . They seemed to have less screen time than the rest of the stars . This is not a serious complaint of the film itself , just a desire for more -LRB- especially Ogre -RRB- . Skinny Puppy fans have never seen Ogre quite like this -LRB- just wait until you hear his voice -RRB- . Other personal favorites -LRB- aside from Ogre -RRB- were The Grave Robber , Anthony Head , and Sarah Brightman . Darren , the Cast and Crew , and the Producers of Repo the Genetic Opera have created a beautiful thing here . This is a horror movie with true originality in story and in visuals . They went out on a limb to make something new , something that has n't already been proved to work and that type of effort needs to be supported ; otherwise we will continue to be given `` New '' movies that it feels like we have seen before . I know the wait has been long , but I can now tell you with certainty that it is well worth the wait . If originality is not supported it will continue to disappear . Please support Repo the Genetic Opera . " ,10
" A cult wannabe with a dash of Blade Runner and a slash of Saw . Darren Lynn Bousman has cojones . Big brass ones , it would appear , after viewing his twisted eclectic musical known as Repo ! The Genetic Opera , which was given its world premier at Montreal 's Fantasia film festival months in advance of its November release date . The Director of Saw II , III and IV is hardly a person you 'd associate with a rock opera , and when you factor in a cast that includes such artistic polar opposites as Sarah Brightman and Paris Hilton , you could be forgiven for feeling that the stink-o-meter would be going off the chart . And yet , it does n't . Set against a futuristic backdrop where an epidemic of organ failures is plaguing humanity , people turn to the unscrupulous Geneco Corporation to purchase replacements for their failing vitals . Not everybody makes good on their payments , however , which is where Nathan Wallace -LRB- Anthony Head of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame -RRB- goes into action as one of Geneco 's `` repo men '' , brutally reclaiming defaulters organs at scalpel-point . The movie has a visual style that both works to its benefit and runs against the grain of conventional movie telling -LRB- comic strip look , richly colored and stylized sets , heavily filtered camera shots -RRB- and much of the music is surprisingly good . Even those sung by Hilton , who blends surprisingly well into the mix as Amber , the vain , plastic-surgery obsessed daughter of Geneco 's president -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- . While Sarah Brightman 's career as a pop-opera singer makes her , on paper at least , the best casting choice , it 's Head who 's really surprising . Sure he an act , but in a movie with no spoken dialog he not only shows he can sing , but is actually able to change his vocal style from controlled , when in character as Wallace , to raunchy when he dons his Repo Man persona . Among the movie 's flaws is the performance of Bill Moseley -LRB- House of 1000 Corpses , The Devil 's Rejects -RRB- as Luigi Largo , the scheming son of Geneco 's president , whose singing talent can charitably be described as `` lacking '' . Then again , considering the nature of the story , its roles , and ambitious scope , you 'd have to expect that Bousman was going to break a few eggs en route to making his omelet . The folks who run the hype machines at Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures are spinning this as another cult classic along the lines of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Phantom of the Paradise . That 's a bit much . Musical cult classics are n't instantly created , they assume that mantle as a result of fan approval , and the cultivation of a following something not easily done given the demise of repertory cinemas and weekly midnight screenings . Right now such corporate accolades are nothing more than hyperbole . Even though a lot of the prerequisites are in place , only time will tell if Repo will allow Bousman to reserve a permanent spot shilling to character-dressed fans on the convention circuit . " ,7
" A very cool modern opera that will surely be playing at midnight screenings as a cult classic for years to come . This modern , actually futuristic , opera is unlike anything I 've seen . Many of its qualities remind me of ` The Rocky Horror Picture Show , ' a film that was never on my list of favorites . This is better simply because it 's able to hold together a more plausible and serious story yet still present itself in the aesthetic of a psychedelic musical . It blends brutality with comedy and music very effectively , in fact , there were far more laughs in our theater than anything else . The interactions between the characters as they sing their parts make for great character development and story progression simultaneously . The character 's themselves are all well performed , including Paris Hilton -LRB- what happens to her needs to be seen , not described -RRB- . I 'm not the type to like weird , cult films but this held my attention . It 's definitely worth a viewing , and if you have time to immerse yourself , then it 's definitely worth some good applause . " ,9
" This movie is like seeing a supergroup in concert ! . A lot of films have interesting trailers . Repo ! The Genetic Opera has a few music videos available for viewing at http:\/\/repo-opera.com . Those are small teasers for the experience you 'll have when you see this movie in theaters ! A superb surround mix and amazing talent are displayed in this film , which combines several genres with acting talent from Anthony Head , Sarah Brightman , Alexa Vega , Paul Sorvino , Ogre -LRB- of the band Skinny Puppy -RRB- , Bill Moseley and newcomer to movies but not to his role Terrance Zdunich as the Graverobber . It feels like you 've gone to a huge rock show and seen an amazing supergroup in concert . The only things that could make it better are having the show be sold out by fans that know the words to every song and can sing along , having the show be on tour and hit every major city in the world and having several encores after the crowd demands it ! Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a film I encourage everyone to take the time to experience , and if you can , be sure to see it on the big screen . " ,10
" Best Musical of The Year . It is a superlative movie through and through , what a phenomenal piece of work . It is such an amazing and very cool artistically rich and collaboratively ingenious of characters with rich metal Gothic and opera soul . I absolutely , positively , inequitably loved all of Sarah Brightman 's performances , it was not only rocking hot , she was a phenomenally endowed character in this movie . I think she had an epic role in this movie . This is a hot movie . Must be seen and it is more than just blood and guts indeed . We were singing along with the songs the second go round and it was absolutely fantastic . I am in awe that it is so much better , no exquisite , than I had foreseen . Here 's a salute to our magnificent -LRB- Blind Mag -RRB- star and all the collaborative stardom , specifically the writer Terrance and Darren director and the greatly cast stars among them that also enriched this movie with such superlative talents , work and dedication . It is a masterpiece . It would be shameless to let all of it go unnoticed and unappreciated . I 'm quite positive there would be a huge following if marketed to appeal to viewers from many genres . I am an open minded viewer of many things and quite honestly was n't sure that I would like this movie in it 's entirety given the bits of news , trailers , clips , advertisement but I was completely detoured from this idea not once but twice seeing this richly written , sketched , musically infused , fully fulfilling outstanding vocals , and directed by a master artist this piece of artistic collaboration come to be known as Repo-The Genetic Opera . Darren , Terrance , his musical sidekick , friends , Lionsgate representatives and phenomenal crew are astounding characters , down to earth people , kind , generous , and appreciative of the reviews of their expanded efforts to bring this to many a movie goer of music , rock , futuristic , comic book character lover , fashion lovers , horror story tempting embellisher , Sarah Brightman fan , Darren fan -LRB- director of Saw movies 1,2 , 3 -RRB- , and so much more . Not only is it written with perfection , been brought through stage production , to movie script , to now a movie of fully enriched characters and character sketches that deserve any movie screen . All of you here and about , do n't miss the chance to see Repo on it 's maiden voyage road trip across the US and hopefully much more . I truly think there is something for everyone to love about this movie and it indeed deserves to hit the big screens and more . I must say I do n't profoundly pitch or push quite so personally for many a thing but I do think such rare and beautiful talents should not go unnoticed and unappreciated . " ,10
" Nothing Like It . I have been to cult films , I have been to great grand openings of everything from movies to books to games to this and that . If there is an opening , I will go to it . This movie ... this entire experience , it was like nothing I 've ever been to in my life . People are asking whether or not this type of movie will gain ` cult ' status , but the fact of the matter is ... it already has . To quote Darren : `` I 'm standing up here , and I see that seventy percent of you are in costume , and the others are saying ` Damnit , why did n't I dress up ? ' . '' Dressing up is n't all that makes a cult , the fans are . The fact of the matter is , this movie has a rabid , feasting fanbase that would gladly hog-tie and grapple you to the movie just so that you have the experience of seeing it . Those who say that this movie is crap , that it does n't have an audience , and that the music is -LRB- my personal favorite -RRB- ` atonal ' , either were n't watching , listening or paying any attention to it at all . This movie is worth far more than anything I 've seen in theaters for years . It is easily the most unique experience of my life . I 'd rather see something completely unique , even if it 's offensive , gritty , shot with hand-held camera and staring sock puppets than watch anymore of the ` wannabe ' good movies that have been coming out . These ` Masterpieces ' that people consider to be SO amazing have nothing on a movie like this . This movie is untouchable , it is completely beyond all words . Everything about this movie has a unique touch that is completely noticeable in absolutely every scene and song . It is an insult to creativity and artistry that a movie such as this should be shoved into only seven cities and outcasting all those who want to watch it so badly . Myself and two friends drove down from Canada to watch it in Seattle , and we were n't the only ones , and some of the people at our showing were from Texas . This movie will surpass any movie this year through the years , simply because of the fans . Do NOT miss watching this movie . If you can watch it , even if the theater is three or four hours away ... DO IT . Go in costume , shriek and have the best time of your life . " ,10
" An amazing experience that should be shared by all . I attended an advanced screening being held at my university . It was one of the few shows that director Darren Lynn Bousman did n't know about . I had spoken with him briefly on the repo-opera . com official chat rooms about an hour before the showing . It was a cool few minutes that consisted of him telling me the showing might have been canceled and then his informing me -LRB- and the rest of the room -RRB- that he was yelling to get it going , and he never yells . I got to the campus theater about 10 min before it was set to start . First thing I noticed was that there were other people there , which was a major worry of mine as Montana State University is relatively small and the advertisement for the screening was pretty sparse . Then I saw the security officers . That got my eyebrows a-raising . It was cool though , Lionsgate taking this much of a precaution even in a little city like this one . After getting my ticket , I wandered in and took a seat . There were about 5 of us to begin with , but as we got closer to 7:00 , we ended up with around 30 people . That alone exceeded my expectations . Then the one of the theater workers came out and spoke with us , made us aware of the security and told us basically not to F \*\*\* this up with cameras . Then it was movie time . When if first began the audio was n't syncing properly and the screen was projected a little too wide . But after about 5 min the audio got straightened out and the screen width only affected some of the captions on the vignettes showing backstory . Overall , I was very impressed . Alexa Vega was amazing as the main character of Shiloh Wallace . She has really grown up and away from the girl who played in Spy Kids . She 's not this awkward little kid anymore . She 's a full blown woman who 's shown her acting and singing abilities . I hope to see a lot more from her in the future . Anthony Stewart Head as Nathan\/Repo Man was just as amazing . His baritone had the perfect inflection to show the torment the character was dealing with emotionally . When he switches to his `` Repo '' voice , an oddly smooth yet gravelly take on his singing , it details the change in personalities . Sarah Brightman shined as Blind Mag . Her gorgeous voice and regal demeanor added mountains of formality to this amazing production . Terrance Zdunich was a treat as the morally ambiguous Graverobber . His narrating skills balanced the movie in a way . Addressing the audience as a sort of gatekeeper to this experience was a needed flavor to the film . Now onto the Largos . Paul Sorvino , like Ms. Brightman , added an air to the movie . His very operatic voice was a perfect counter to the more modern sounds of his on-screen spawn . Bill Mosely , a genre favorite , was well cast in the role of Luigi Largo , Rotti Largo 's violent son . His face added a brutality to the roll . Nivek Ogre , of Skinny Puppy , was a very mellow character in his take on Pavi well , mellow compared to Luigi , choosing to seduce and womanize instead of kill and murder . And finally , Paris Hilton as Amber Sweet . I think everyone was a bit wary of her role in this movie . But I ca n't imagine anyone else in the role . Overall , the performances were very well done . Only Mosely and Hilton seemed to struggle and only at very brief times . The music was stellar . I was expecting it to be a total musical overload of 100 % song , but instead it was interspersed with regular dialog and sing-talk , but it never got old or tired . The filter they used to color the movie was wonderful ; the soft glow gave it a wonderful ambiance . The story itself was very well done , showing the dynamics of two families , one a little more functional then the other . Definitely a very original and wonderful piece of modern film . It really is an event . And an event that should be experienced in a theater with other people with an appreciation for the quirky and the musical . It fully deserved the claps it received at the end . Very well done , Darren . Thank you , to you and your cast and crew . " ,10
" Genetics are a B \*\*\*\* . I got a chance to see Repo ! at the Austin showing last night . I 'd been keeping up with the forum , like most of ya 'll have , and listening to the soundtrack on a loop . I thought I pretty much knew the whole plot before I 'd seen the movie , and had a good idea of how it would end . I was wrong . For those of you who have n't been following the Repo ! phenomenon , Repo ! is an audacious rock opera -LRB- completely sung , with some occasional atonal , rhythmic dialogue -RRB- that takes place in a Gothic not-too-distant future . An epidemic of organ failures has broken out , but luckily , GeneCo , a massive genetics company , has a solution - They start harvesting organs and offering them to consumers with easy financing options . However , these organs are subject to default , and if you start missing your payments , GeneCo sends out the Repo Man to take back GeneCo 's property . Guiding us through this macabre world is Graverobber -LRB- Zdunich -RRB- , a drug-runner who sells a cheap , black market version of Zydrate -LRB- a futuristic anesthetic that 's like a glow-in-the-dark mix between codeine and ecstasy -RRB- to drug-and-surgery addicts on the street . The movie largely takes place from the point of view of one of these Repo Men , Nathan Wallace -LRB- Head -RRB- , and his daughter , Shiloh -LRB- Vega -RRB- , who is suffering from an unnamed blood illness that makes traveling outside of her home dangerous , and possibly deadly , and who is unaware of her father 's profession . In order to keep her safe , Nathan keeps Shiloh locked in her bedroom . Longing to explore the world outside , and bitter towards her mother for passing the blood disease on to her , Shiloh embodies one of the underlying themes of Repo ! - Are our destinies sealed by fate -LRB- by our genetics -RRB- , or do we have a choice in the matter ? Early on in the movie , Rotti Largo -LRB- Sorvino -RRB- , the owner and founder of GeneCo , learns that his time is running out . Without skipping a beat , his two sons , the hellishly-tempered Luigi -LRB- Moseley -RRB- and the freakish playboy , Pavi -LRB- Ogre -RRB- , begin to fight over who will take over when their father is gone . Meanwhile , the third Largo sibling , and poster child for the Zydrate Support Network , Amber Sweet -LRB- Hilton -RRB- , dreams of being in the spotlight after the popular opera singer , and GeneCo spokeswoman , Blind Mag -LRB- Brightman -RRB- , gives her upcoming farewell performance . The film explores the connections between each of these individuals , and gives their backstories in comic book style vignettes that show how their lives were all once intertwined . Even if you 've been following the Repo ! site , these short stories provide shocking twists -LRB- I heard more than a few gasps when one such twist is revealed -RRB- . They 're an ingenious way of providing these back stories in a stylized manner without having to stretch Repo ! 's already thin budget . One of the things that really struck me about Repo ! is how surreal the whole atmosphere is . The colors are very garish -LRB- lots of reds , blues , and yellows -RRB- , and a very hyper-polished finish to the picture . Your computer screen really ca n't capture just how amazing it looks on the big screen . And , of course , the other thing that stands out is the music . It 's an eclectic mix of rock , punk , pop , electronica , and , of course , opera . I was a bit worried that since I 'd been listening to the Pre-Surgery Sampler on a loop , and listening to the theatrical CD as well , that I 'd pretty much heard the outstanding numbers in the movie , and that there would n't be many surprises . Again , I was surprised . One of the stand-outs for me was `` Things You See In A Graveyard '' , with Rotti Largo 's voice echoing throughout the atmosphere over a ghostly chorus of funeral-goers and thrashing guitar riffs . My other favorite is `` Chromaggia 's Lament '' , Mag 's haunting , operatic farewell song . While Repo ! is VERY unique , and has some very colorful characters , it is n't the camp fest that I was expecting it to be . It 's actually a very GOOD movie , and definitely has a heart behind all of it 's badassness . It 's also VERY graphic . It was actually a bit more violent than I was expecting . While the violence typically occurs during songs that lessen their impact , and make them more humorous than scary , it 's still very over-the-top , and several scenes in particular caused people in my screening to gasp and scream . My only complaint about the film is that it occasionally appears a bit conflicted about what emotion it wants to elicit from you . I 'll give you an example -LRB- and forgive me if it comes off as vague , I 'm avoiding spoilers -RRB- - In one scene in particular , the gorgeously eery song being sung leads up to an act that is both powerfully moving and deeply repulsing . If it were a bit more tastefully executed , it would have come off as a beautiful , empowering scene , and a highly memorable one at that . However , rather than going for that particular emotional impact , the camera lingers on the extremely violent act being committed , without cutting away , to the point of being completely over-the-top , snuffing out its emotional aspect and causing it to be remembered as one of the most disgusting scenes in the movie , rather than one of the most beautiful . Overall , I would definitely say that I enjoyed Repo ! , and I 'm looking forward to buying the soundtrack on September 30th . This movie is something that needs to be experienced on the big screen . For anyone concerned about contented-related issues -LRB- if you 're wondering if you should take your child , or if you have problems watching certain film content -RRB- , here 's how I 'd rate it : Violence : 9\/10 -LRB- not pervasive , but when it happens , it 's very graphic -RRB- Sex : 4\/10 -LRB- some dialogue , situations , and mild nudity . . nothing to write home about -RRB- Scares : 5\/10 -LRB- some disturbing situations ... but it 's mostly darkly humorous , rather than scary -RRB- " ,9
" Repo ! is a great rock horror opera that I recommend to all ! . I went to the Austin Fantastic Fest previewing of this film and thoroughly enjoyed it . There were unexpected twists , as well as great character dynamics that made it interesting , fun to watch , and the story line -LRB- with the help of great graphics and comics -RRB- was easy to follow . The music is catchy and incorporates several ideas that are often taken for granted in popular music . Many styles of music mixed together engaged the listener and the lyrics were full of life and zest . The casting was very well done -LRB- where else could you find Paris Hilton and Sarah Brightman in the same cast ? -RRB- and allowed each character to have their outstanding quality that made them memorable . This movie easily could become a cult classic , as it 's right up there with `` The Rocky Horror Picture Show '' ! Go see it , it 's totally worth the time . More than worth it , actually . " ,10
" Fills your heart with amazing music , then rips it out ... . I am flabbergasted ... I am shocked ... I am amazed ... I am currently scooping my jaw off of the floor ... I just saw Repo . My friend introduced me to the music ... and I was initially attracted to Anthony Head -LRB- I am Buffy Fan to the max -RRB- and more than a little intrigued at the thought of Paris Hilton in a musical . I read the plot , and was very confused , and then I heard a few songs . I did n't get it at all , and they did n't sound very good -LRB- out of context -RRB- . A few songs stood out as particularly confusing , and a few were at least tolerable . In fear of hating the movie , I stopped listening and waiting until I saw it . I do however , appreciate musicals , and I have a twisted sense of humor , so I figured `` Why not ? '' But even up to the MOMENT this movie started , I was fearfully twiddling my thumbs ... pondering and escape route if this reached a Max Payne level of unbearable . While in the line up for the movie , the Director -LRB- Darren Lynn Bousman -RRB- and the Co-writer\/Graverobber -LRB- Terrance Zdunich -RRB- , and the Musical Director -LRB- I apologize , I ca n't remember his name ... -RRB- came and talked to everyone . I was surprised at their enthusiasm for this movie , and how amazingly down to earth they were . Those are the coolest guys you will ever meet . Ever . And you could tell they were very humble when everyone was proclaiming their love for REPO , even before they saw it . So the movie started , and since the first second I was captivated . As soon as I heard the deathly choir sing `` Repo Man '' I was hooked . The opening shots of the comics were a brilliant way of introducing the story , and I was amazed at the fact that Terrance Zdunich drew it all himself . The movie was not the best singing , and not the best acting in the world -LRB- Although major points for Anthony Head 's portrayal of Repo Man -RRB- but I still was captivated by the music , and the amazing sets , and fantastic overall cinematography . A few moments stood out in my head , their budget was a very limited 8 million dollars ... so their ability to produce convincing prosthetic recreations of the inside of your chest cavity is simply stunning . I have heard a lot of complaining that this movie is too gory . I do n't understand . It is gory with purpose ... when there is gore , it makes sense and follows the story . They do n't have anything that is unnecessary or unbelievable . Another point is the music ... the songs are simply stunning . I did n't even notice the screaming at certain points , it all flowed together . And each song was poignant , original , and thought provoking . `` Chase the Morning '' , `` Zydrate Anatomy '' , and `` Who Started this Opera Sh \* t '' , as well as `` I Did n't Know I Loved You So Much '' . I have seen musicals that are completely singing , and you get tired of all the annoying repetitive music . But I found each section of the movie , down to each note , was carefully written . I instantly changed my mind , every piece of music in this movie is a masterpiece , and I have changed my mind on this kind of music . And it also managed to mix twisted humor , opera , horror , and raw emotion into one movie . I have n't seen such a complex mix like that in a long time . My ONE problem with this movie , is the growth of the characters . It simply does n't exist . There are a few small changes in the personalities , but the overall development is seriously lacking . On the other hand , this is set in a world where people are who they are , and it is believable that they would be that same person in such a corrupt state . I also ca n't wait for the Directors Cut , there are several songs , and scenes that were cut do to timing , and budgeting . Close to an hour of footage was discarded . I know the directors cut take this movie past incredible , into the mind-blowing . The other problem I have is that this movie is in dire need of support . The production company does n't think that this movie has a fan base , or that it is any good at all ... I disagree for the most part . While I thoroughly enjoyed it , I do n't think that it should be released in every theater in existence . It would be removed very soon . I do however believe that this movie should n't be hid away and burned ... But released in select theaters across America , Canada , and UK and such . This movie will take time to build an extreme following . And already with its 2 or 3 showings , it has a massive fan base . Give this movie time and it will be bigger than Star Wars , Harry Potter -LRB- shudder -RRB- , and even Rocky Horror Picture Show . Way , way bigger . I love this movie . I love , love this movie . It deserves so much credit for pushing through the awful reviews for Paris -LRB- in which she was a perfect choice -RRB- , and for being told to hide this movie away and burn every copy ... I can understand that this movie might not be for you , but it not worst trash to ever hit the movie theaters . I am not giving this movie a 10 , because I do believe that a 10 cheapens it . I am not simply going to rate it a 10 to support the movie ... I am going to be honest , and give it the 9 that it deserves . We do owe it that much ... for giving us a movie that fills our hearts with amazing music , then rips it out , 'cause we ca n't pay . Spencer " ,8
" No more remakes ! I want Repo !!! . I have been waiting a long time to see something original , a new idea , a new concept . For once , I was not disappointed . I took my best friend , Nathan , out to see Repo ! The Genetic Opera as a birthday present . First off , Nathan and I are both very picky when it comes to art and beauty , him more so than I , and we were both extremely impressed with what we saw last night . There is so much garbage spoon fed to us every single time a new movie hits the theater , and for once ... for once , this movie was not even in the slightest , a let down . The premise behind the movie is that there 's this huge epidemic of Organ failure in the world , and when this happens , Genco steps up with the cure ... organs on a payment plan . The only catch is that if you sign the paper work that saves your life , you are also indebted to Genco until you are finished paying off your new organs . However ... if you miss a payment , Genco sends the Repo man after you to repossess what is theirs . On top of this , the entire movie is a rock opera . When you see the movie , it 's amazing that they had such a low budget to put it all together , because it does n't show AT ALL . Repo ! Has been a labor of love for the writer for 8 years now , and a lot of thought to detail went into this movie ... he even studied surgery so medical terms and ways of removing body parts made the movie feel more legit . Instead of making a bunch of stuff up as he went a long . The scenes that were corny were done intentionally , the scenes that were comical were intentional , and executed perfectly . The music -LRB- amazing -RRB- , the cinematography , the wardrobe , everything was amazing . I did n't even cringe once when Paris Hilton took the screen , she played her roll believably ... I even forgot it was Paris Hilton ... and Ogre ... OH my god ! that man is a genius ! Sarah Brightman 's voice is incredible ... the whole movie , beginning to end was absolutely amazing ... some parts felt like a comic book , and I love how the theme of the movie touched on topics that are happening all around us now in the real world . After the movie was over , the director , composer , and co-writer took the stage for some Q A , and one of the questions a member of the audience asked was where the idea generated from ... Reposessing organs . The writer -LRB- who also plays grave robber in the movie -RRB- said that where he lives -LRB- So Cal -RRB- , plastic surgery is a way of life ... most of the people have implants , face lifts , collagen in the lips , hell even on the less extremes , people are constantly dying their hair , getting tattoos ... whatever , organ and face replacement is pretty much the next rung up the ladder ... personally , the concept itself is very believable . The movie touches briefly -LRB- if you pay attention -RRB- on how people do n't need to keep changing themselves , they are fine the way they are , but not in such a way that it become preachy or a huge theme in the movie , it 's set as more of a matter of opinion of a character than something to change the mind of anyone sitting in the audience . The sad thing about this movie is that the critics hate it , and wanted to make it go away , which is why instead of being released everywhere on the 7th , it was cut back to a 7 city road tour . The critics do n't think there is an audience for this sort of thing . They say it 's the worst movie ever made , yet they allow Hollywood to rape our childhood with remakes like Dr. Doolittle . And god forbid it ever comes to life , but Mtv-of all things-wants to remake Rocky Horror Picture show . I 'm sick of seeing all the carp that comes out of Hollywood , I seriously do n't watch a lot of TV or movies , because most of everything that comes out is continually recycled garbage . This was completely new , a new concept , a new place , a new story , a true original . That in itself makes it worth watching . And it is an instant cult classic . Over half the audience was dressed up as characters from the movie and knew half the songs , but had never seen the movie ! That 's how excited they were about it . Nathan and I had wished we had dressed up to go see it , and if they are able to release it in Seattle , you better believe we 'll be there again , and in costume this time . It was fun , it was funny , it was serious , it was Opera , it was amazing . In a world where everyone is pushed to be the same , it was nice to see something original ... and the songs ... catchy ... Nathan and I kept singing parts of the movie on the way home . Okay okay ... if this movie is n't playing where you are , demand it , and do n't pirate this . Support art . This movie is a labor of love , and all behind it are extremely passionate and truly believe in the project . I could literally go on forever about this , it 's one of my new favorite movies , but I wo n't . :-RRB- You should go see it for yourself . " ,10
" Interesting ... but not very good at all . . Repo ! has ambition and even a bit of talent . Unfortunately , the talent is badly wasted , largely due to a musical score that 's weak , and fast n ' sloppy editing that does nothing to develop the characters . Sarah Brightman , for instance , has a world class voice ... horribly wasted on the music she performs , although at least she was given the saving grace of writing her own lyrics ... Unfortunately , the other characters were not so fortunate , as the lyrics were painfully inane and banal at points . Indeed , the only character who \* did n't \* suffer from painfully bad lyrics and music was Terrance Zdunich , who , along with Darren Smith , created Repo and wrote the music and lyrics . He was apparently aware of how \* his \* narrative approach would work with the music , and made sure that it did n't overpower what he was trying to get across ... but unfortunately , he did n't give that same courtesy to poor Sarah Brightman or Paul Sorvino . Paris Hilton was given a Razzie for her performance ... and though it was pretty weak , it 's really hard to say she was worse than other parts of this movie . While director Darren Lynn Bousman delivered a visual style that was strong -- albeit a bit too derivative of the video game Bioshock in parts for comfort -- he also brought his fast 'n' choppy Saw editing with him , which was unfortunate , as more style was needed . Musically , I really like Ogre from Skinny Puppy . I appreciate the vocal talents of Sarah Brightman . I wanted to like this . Unfortunately , I could n't , because the underlying musical sucks . No amount of window dressing can change that fact . " ,2
" I asked for originality , and I got it . And I got to see Paris humiliate herself . . In past reviews , I 've countless repeated the line : `` This movie is hard to review because it 's so blatantly unoriginal . It 's like reviewing a 2-hour session of staring at the wall . I 've seen it so many times , forcing myself to have a negative or positive opinion on it is impossible . So I just give it the lowest score there is . '' But the day has finally come that I can say the exact opposite . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is hard to review because it 's so blatantly original . On the list of things I review on , originality is at the top , with how memorable the film was in second . Contrary to what people will try to say , the two almost always go hand-in-hand . Repo ! nails both . I 've seen countless reviews stating that Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a bastard child of Blade Runner and The Rocky Horror Picture show , but I disagree . There is some Blade Runner influence in the outdoor imagery , and that 's it . Also , just because it 's in the same genre as The Rocky Horror Picture Show does not mean it 's anything like it . My point is , Repo ! is completely unlike anything I 've ever experienced before . It is a genre piece , but a lot like Pulp Fiction before it , it creates original scenes within its respective genre that have never been done before it . Most notably , I was impressed by how minimal the movie is . Instead of taking the brash epic scope that every other movie in its genre takes , Repo ! takes place almost completely in one house . It 's a story about a sole family , not about a clich d sci-fi world with clich heroes and villains and wars . It 's far too original and daring for that . Another notable original aspect is the characters . I 've never seen a less clich d character line-up in almost the last three decades of cinema . For example , Luigi and Pavi are only secondary characters , and they alone have more actual character than almost any main character I 've seen in years . We live in a time where films like No Country for Old Men get the highest ratings possible , while they present new ideas about as much as rocks produce quality grade milk . Whether you liked it or not , any movie this original needs to receive credit for that . The story itself is surprisingly complex . You have no idea what is going to happen until it happens . There is nothing liner or even possibly predictable . It will take most people 3 views to fully get what happened . There is also an underline moral that is relevant and not forced in any way . On the artistic scale ... dear God , how do I even begin here ? The amount of detail and uniqueness put into the art direction is absolutely insane . As some reviews have stated , it 's nearly impossible to process it all . This is not the safe , predictable Goth cinematography whatsoever . It puts Sweeney Todd to thumb-sucking shame . It does for our generation what A Clockwork Orange did for the 70s . The directing itself is absolutely godlike . Darren Lynn Bousman knows FAR more than just how to flash-cut and get the most effective gore scenes that cinema has known . In Repo ! , he expresses careful skill with the camera , and makes everything look polished -LRB- or grungy -RRB- to perfection . It 's no surprise that the gore scenes have some of the best cinematography in the film because of Bousman 's Saw background . There is a lot more gore than I expected , and none of it is generic . Even the dramatic scenes ooze of careful , effective camera-work . Bousman proves he is easily one of the best modern directors working today . Despite everything I just said , there are a few flaws . Mainly that the Goth appearance can get a little silly at points , but it 's not something prevalent whatsoever . This is far from a straight-up geek movie , though it is certainly an acquired taste . Also , the final act got a little too ridicules for its own good in a few places . Namely the entire opening song . Do not be scared away from this movie because it 's an opera . The singing is n't as annoying as it is in Sweeney Todd , or as downright stupid as in Hairspray . This is a real man 's opera . The rock-based music keeps the movie moving and gives it a punk edge . And like the music , Repo ! The Genetic Opera is one of the most daring and edgy movies to come out in a long time . It 's not the cookie-cutter Goth movie . It 's not something geeks will get it up to . It 's not an unoriginal movie . It 's punk , and not in a classic Blade Runner-type way . When something is this different from the norm , it 's bound to throw-off the easy-going fine-cinema-whores who like their movies so unoriginal they 're as easy to watch -LRB- and as boring -RRB- as staring at a wall . It 's bound to get bad reviews because of that . Ignore them . Repo ! is absolute punk cinema with maturity . " ,8
" Visually arresting but deeply stupid . I 'm giving Repo two stars rather than one because it did have a few redeeming elements in my book . It was visually very arresting , and the world depicted was oddly believable . I watched it all the way through , although I have to admit I watched most of Repo with eyes rolling and several derisive barks of laughter . The comparisons to Sweeney Todd and Rocky Horror do not fit for me . Sweeney Todd is one of the most intelligently written pieces of musical theater in the history of theater . Repo the Genetic Opera is , ultimately , deeply stupid , boiling down to a -RRB- the plot , which has more holes than cohesion and b -RRB- the lyrics , which are just about the worst lyrics I 've ever heard sung . And I 've heard a lot of lyrics in my time . So what now follows is a series of questions , all of which are probably spoilers . ~ ~ SPOILER ALERT ~ ~ ! 1 -RRB- So , wait , people take the glowing blue drug in order to feel no pain from the surgeries they are addicted to ? So are they addicted to the surgeries or the drug ? 2 -RRB- So the Repo Man apparently can find you wherever you are . Why is it , then , that all of his victims come to him ? 3 -RRB- Is there just one Repo Man ? Just one ? For all of this population who is apparently having all of these surgeries done ? That would be one heck of a busy man . 4 -RRB- So , wait . The surgeries people are having are life-saving surgeries in order to have failing organs replaced with new ones ? If this is the case then why are people ` addicted to surgery ? ' Where does this whole plastic surgery fit in with this picture ? Are they life-saving organ transplants or face-changing surgeries ? 5 -RRB- So , with the Paris Hilton character . If her father is the richest , most powerful person on the planet then why is she getting surgeries on the street ? 6 -RRB- Is everyone goth in the future ? 7 -RRB- I would just like to point out that ` anatomy ' and ` surgery ' do not rhyme . Ever . 8 -RRB- So , wait . Paul Sorvino is this humanity-saving person who found a way to replace organs . Why , then , is he also humanity 's scoundrel , taking the organs back ? Did he develop this system of organ replacement simply to take the organs back ? If that is the case then is n't humanity in the same place as it was during the ` plague ' -LRB- or whatever vague thing it was that made organs fail in the first place -RRB- with organs failing or being ripped out ? 9 -RRB- So , the Repo man rips out an organ . Then what ? Does it get re-used ? Or does he do it simply to punish people who do n't pay ? 10 -RRB- Okay , wait . So the father\/Repo man\/doctor character is told that he has to take out Blind Mag 's eyes because he believes he poisoned his own wife 17 years ago ? What kind of logic is that ? Dude , you have to take this lady 's eyes out . Why ? Because you poisoned your wife 17 years ago . Yes , I see what you mean . Where 's my scalpel ? 11 -RRB- So , wait . If the father is so concerned about his daughter not dying then why is he poisoning her ? Um , what ? 12 -RRB- Why does Blind Mag yank her eyes out ? 13 -RRB- So , wait . Shilo obviously thinks Blind Mag is super cool . Why , then , does she not let her in the house when she visits ? Oh hi , Blind Mag . You 're an international superstar and everything and I think you 're really cool but no , you ca n't come in . For some reason , I 'm inexplicably afraid of you right now . Nope . Ca n't even open the door . My father will be mad , although I ca n't explain why . 14 -RRB- Riffing on # 13 : if Shilo 's reason for not letting Blind Mag in is because her father will be mad -LRB- why would he be mad ? -RRB- then why is it when her father comes home Shilo insists that they let Blind Mag in all of a sudden ? And if Shilo is all afraid of her father then why does she start yelling at her father when he says Blind Mag has to go ? Is Shilo the only person who sees the article in the tabloid that says Blind Mag is going to have her eyes repossessed ? Are tabloids 100 % accurate in the future ? Did anyone read this script through before they started filming ? 15 -RRB- And , yeah . Shilo 's father locks her in her room , right ? And Shilo goes to her balcony and sings that she wants to go outside , indicating that she is locked in . In subsequent scenes she just , um , walks outside . Does n't even climb down from her window . I am making a call to the Continuity Police . 16 -RRB- I know this is way too much to ask , but why are Paul Sorvino 's kids all one-dimensional unpleasant idiots ? Do n't give me this ` they 're fighting over the family business ' hoo-hah . 17 -RRB- If grave robbers are executed on sight , then why does n't the grave-robber-executing-squad execute the grave robber when they see him ? Why do they mill around and around , ignoring him completely but then suddenly focusing on Shilo who is hiding behind a tombstone ? 18 -RRB- So you just put a needle into a dead person 's nose and extract a glowing blue drug ? I see . That makes sense . There 's a lot more , of course . But I do n't want to think about this any more . As I said , there are far more holes than there is any continuity . But above all , the lyrics are wretched . Bad , bad lyrics . " ,2
" An amazing ride . Obviously if you are n't into musicals , especially operas , well this movie is not for you . That being said , if you can handle singing throughout the movie well then , enjoy the ride . The movie itself is actually not bad at all , the acting is great and the music is sensational . At first I had my doubts but a second watch around let me see how amazing the music and cinematography really was . The final scene has one of the most emotional yet beautiful songs in the movie . It 's gory yet hilarious and has its own satire . This movie is not for everyone but if you would like to see great songs being performed in many ways you would n't expect then give this a try . Alexa Vega and Sarah Brightman were outstanding . You either hate it or love it , or even a little bit of both . " ,9
" It is Lion 's Gate fault . I 'll say what I have yet to see in comments . Lion 's gate only placed this in limited theaters , and they were wrong to do so . The sheer concept behind this movie was so fresh , and the intrigue so compelling . The budget alone to make this movie should have demanded that it open theater wide . Yet , Lion 's Gate fell through and the possible fans that it should have had were lost . Fans join together and make new fans of the movie . The only thing that Lion 's Gate should do is give the rights to Terrance Zdunich and \/ Darren Lynn Bousman . I know the Repo Army would be there with bells on , just like we are there for The Devil 's Carnival ! " ,10
" A truly amazing film . . I was introduced to this film the fall of 2008 by one of my best friends . She watched it and automatically knew I would love it and she was right . From the first scene , I was intrigued . The characters , the plot , the music ... it all captured my heart . I found myself being able to relate to the character Shilo in some ways . I was hesitant when I learned that Paris Hilton was in the movie , but after seeing it I grew to like her just because of her role in the film . She did an amazing job . Anthony Stewart Head is an amazing actor and has a fantastic voice -LRB- those of you who watched Buffy should remember this from the musical episode -RRB- . His character is just amazing ... And Alexa Vega ... I grew up watching her in Spy Kids and she has always been an excellent actress . She shines in this role . If you like musicals or gory horror films , you will love it . The songs were stuck in my head after the first time I watched it and honestly , they still are . The creators of this film are genius . If you watch this and decided you like it , I highly suggest you research their new movie The Devil 's Carnival which will be released in just a few days . It even has a few of the same actors from Repo ! " ,10
" A gloriously offbeat and inventive one-of-a-kind futuristic sci-fi musical marvel . In the bleak and hopeless near future a worldwide epidemic causes an alarming array of organ failures . The mighty and amoral biotech company GENECO rises to power by offering the desperate masses new organs . Folks who fail to keep up on their payments for their organs are targeted by the dreaded Repo Man . Bitter and ruthless GENECO founder Rotti Largo -LRB- an excellent portrayal by Paul Sorvino -RRB- is dying of a terminal disease . His grotesque kids -- vain , plastic surgery-obsessed daughter Amber Sweet -LRB- a shockingly good Paris Hilton -RRB- , deranged , bad-tempered son Luigi -LRB- the always creepy Bill Moseley in his freaky element -RRB- , and Luigi 's infantile disfigured sibling Pavi -LRB- the fine Ogre Nivek -RRB- -- squabble amongst each other over who 's going to inherent the family business . Meanwhile , frail and sickly teenage innocent Shilo Wallace -LRB- an appealing turn by Alexa Vega -RRB- is locked away in her house by her protective and overbearing doctor father Nathan -LRB- a remarkable performance by Anthony Stewart Head -RRB- . Unbeknownst to Shilo , Nathan works for Rotti as the Repo Man . Everything eventually comes to a full head at the incredible grandiose operatic conclusion . Director Darren Lynn Bousman , working from Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich , expertly crafts a bold , wildly stylized and insanely imaginative brooding Gothic vision of a bleak and decaying future while relating a captivating story of love , betrayal , loyalty and dark family secrets . The cast sink their teeth into their juicy roles with tremendous go-for-it gusto and belt out the songs with comparable rip-snorting relish : Sorvino and Head shine as the two main adversaries , Hilton acquits herself well with her sizable supporting part , Zdunich has a total ball as the ghoulishly charming Graverobber , and Sarah Brightman is terrific as forlorn , yet glamorous GENECO spokeslady Blind Mag . Joseph White 's dazzling cinematography gives the picture a stunning garish look ; the use of comic book panels for the flashbacks is an especially inspired touch . The songs are uniformly tasty and rousing , with the fiercely ripping `` Testify '' rating as the definite stirring stand-out tune . Moreover , we also get a handy helping of grisly gore to further spice up the already deliciously outrageous celluloid stew . A truly unique and impressive oddball cinematic achievement . " ,9
" An Amazing Film ... ! . Being a huge fan of the Saw series , I was waiting two years ago for the release of Saw IV . When I looked up who was going to be the director , and I found out that Darren Lynn Bousman was in doubts due to his work on this film , Repo ! The Genetic Opera , I was n't even interested in Repo ! then , but it did catch my eye . Two years later , I finally saw a trailer for it while looking up certain things for Saw V , and I am so glad that I saw that trailer ... it introduced me to one of the most interesting films that I have seen in quite a while !!! Repo ! The Genetic Opera is definitely not the best film I have ever seen , I 'll say that . But , it 's definitely among the top ones in my list , and I 'm proud to say that I own Repo ! When I say that I am proud to own a movie , I 'm giving it great respect and honor , which is something I do n't usually give to many films . After getting hooked on certain musical films such as Sweeney Todd , Rocky Horror , and RENT , and I found out that Repo ! was a musical , too , I decided to give it a look . I went to my local video store -LRB- I live in a small town , so it 's nothing special ... -RRB- and , as I suspected , they did n't have it . So , I waltzed my way over to Walmart and went ahead and bought it on DVD . Now , I rarely ever buy movies without having seen them already or rented them , so this was a gutsy move , but it was a good one , as well ! I LOVE THIS FILM , and I ca n't stress that enough ! The songs are amazing , the plot is genius , the characters are unreal , and the theme and setting are just outstanding , and I give Darren Lynn Bousman kudos for creating this amazing masterpiece that is definitely a classic !! While this film is under-appreciated , underrated , and not well supported , I strongly recommend this film to anyone who loves musicals , rock music , horror , and classics , because Repo ! is something that I hope many people will discover like I did , and will come to love it like I have ! 9\/10 " ,9
" Repo ! Has its flaws , but it is a unique and entertaining film . See it . . Repo ! is something I never thought I 'd see : A sci-fi rock opera splattered in B-Movie horror and gore . It 's hard to categorize Repo , it has tinges of drama , horror , dark comedy , and even classical opera . I think the `` Graverobber '' summed it up the best ; Repo is a `` Goth opera , blood saga . '' Repo has some memorable music , but unfortunately not everyone can perform . Alexa Vega is a talented singer , but she is n't performing as well as she could be . The people who played Rotti 's kids could n't sing at all , especially not the awful Paris Hilton . The film also seems to have a fair amount of misogyny , not only are most women portrayed as whores , there seems to be an uncomfortable running gag of having women mutilated and dying very painfully in the background in several scenes . However , Rotti Largo , Nathan , and Blind Mag are all great characters and their actors\/actresses have amazing voices . They steal the show from Alexa 's character , Shiloh , which is probably for the best . The visuals are brilliant . One of the most memorable scenes is `` Chase the morning , '' when Blind Mag uses her eyes , that have the power to record memories , to project a ghosted image of Shiloh 's dead mother singing . The scene is haunting and the music in the scene is also great . The world of Repo is stunningly rendered , imagine the city from Blade Runner , but half burned down and littered with dead bodies and cemeteries . Overall , Repo ! is a unique and memorable rock opera , and must be seen to be believed if you can look past its flaws , both small and some glaring . 8\/10 " ,8
" Stellar ! It Is a 21st century Opera . The thing to remember is that what we think of as Opera , gilded up and presented in stuffy City Centres to Ladies in Diamonds and well-heeled Gents in Suits , was actually general entertainment for the common masses in their time . Repo is created in that spirit , but obviously Updated . Funny . Gory . Gothic and Lurid . And cheeky intelligent , too ! Once you settle into the visual style , it fits . It is a Horror show and actually pretty graphic at times . Mix in some snappy sci-fi tech and the song numbers -LRB- Which are meant to be understood as common speech -- not as musical numbers -RRB- and you have a slasher show with rhythm . Yes -- it 's DIFFERENT . This goes Beyond Rocky Horror and takes the concept to the next level . Watch this one . Even with a Girlfriend . If you have the right girlfriend , she will be rapt throughout the show . If she is n't -- Dump her , you can do better . Have some chilled Red Wine with this one . My Favorite Number -- the Blind Singer with the Holographic eyes . Her number in the Repo Man 's house was Spooky cooool ! " ,10
" rock opera of the 21st Century . If you like gore -LRB- or maybe can simply stomach it - no pun intended -RRB- and if you dig movies that are eccentric and weird and dark and musical , check out Repo ! The Genetic Opera . This film is amazing . It 's the most original piece of work to come from a Hollywood director in nearly a decade . Darren Bousman is the director - a man of sequels and low-budget gross-out horror flicks . I hated the SAW films and I was a little apprehensive going into Repo ! because I did n't know if I could handle the gore . But Repo ! is an entirely different monster . It couples gore with absurd sound effects -LRB- kazoos , rubber bands snapping , comic-like effects -RRB- and musical numbers that are either moving or equally ridiculous . The lyrics , though somewhat awkward at moments , are THE movie 's dialog - they help move the story forward . Let me reiterate : THE LYRICS - ARE - THE DIALOGUE . This is an opera ! Every word is basically sung , true to opera form . You can thank creators Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich , who envisioned a macabre opera about the underbelly of a society plagued with the need for plastic surgeries to perfect themselves and replace their dying organs - thanks to Neuro Overstimulation Syndrome , for this unique film . It started as a stage play and while much of the story is lost on translation to film due to budget limitations , it 's a decent beginning to what will hopefully have more pieces put into the puzzle . The comic-book style panels are entrancing and help move the story along , giving the viewer a sort of auditory intermission . They help make up for what could n't be filmed - again , due to limitations - and provide the film with another unique aspect . With players such as Paul Sorvino and Paris Hilton , one can only wonder what the hell Darren was thinking making this film . HOWEVER , these two names are NOT the star players in the film ! Paris has only 12 minutes of actual screen time and Paul is merely a key background player , the villain of the story , a scorned lover bent on revenge . The real stars are Alexa Vega of `` Spy Kids '' fame , who lends her voice to many different styles of singing -LRB- punk rock , lamentation , jazz , etc -RRB- throughout the movie and holds her own as Shilo Wallace and Terrance Zdunich who plays the Graverobber and narrator . Graverobber has far too little screen time ; much of the mid-story narration came only after filming was wrapped and added in to the film post-production . His vocals , while incredibly impressive , leave something desired if you 've heard his stage play renditions of songs like `` 21st Century Cure . '' He does n't display his vocal talent to it 's full potential , but he does a fantastic job nonetheless holding his own against seasoned actors like Bill Moseley and Anthony Stewart Head . There wo n't be another film like this one unless it gets a real fan base going , so if you see it and want to see more , tell your friends to check out the DVD or blu-ray . Get the word out ! Let 's see more original films and less remakes . " ,10
" Shakespearean Gothic Opera . The movie I can best compare this to is not Rocky Horror or Bladerunner , as many critics I 've seen have , but The Crow . Both movies I can remember for awesome stories , but extremely cheesy dialog and awkward movements throughout . Both movies are enjoyable to watch through at least once for anyone ... but sometimes you ca n't stomach another viewing . The lyrics in the music are awkward , sometimes bad beyond all belief , the melody is shaky and seems improvised at points , and many of the actors are just god awful ... However , I could n't help but find myself enjoying this movie greatly . The concept is so realistic and interesting . I can imagine that one day genetic engineering will be perfected and will definitely be used for saving lives , but people who can afford it will abuse the technology as a fashion statement . People exchanging faces , eyes , entire bodies . I remember one line sung by a woman that went `` I needed a kidney transplant desperately ... '' and it ended with her receiving a great body . The message of the film is subtly rubbed violently in the viewer 's face throughout hidden among the Shakespearean plot and bad acting . The futuristic setting and situation is realistic making it so much easier to suspend disbelief . There is dark humor in this movie but it is obviously not meant to be taken seriously . Anyone who gives this movie a bad rating watched it in the wrong eyes . Keep a light heart -LRB- as much as one can during a movie where a man tears innards out of people -RRB- and do n't expect the flick to be Oscar worthy and you 'll have a good time as I have . :D " ,8
" The Future of the Musical film ? . OK , here 's the part everyone else is saying : It 's goth ! It 's gory ! It 's bleak ! What is with the Blade Runner flavor ? Here 's the part you 're not hearing so much : this film is a revival of an art-form that has been dead for over 100 years with updates to meet modern fans . This film is an actual opera , though with mostly modern music . By opera , I mean it - there are no spoken lines and any background that would have been in a playbill in the theater is instead shown to you comic-style on the screen . Being a revival piece , the creators had to take a few chances and pander to the film companies a little . This means there 's gore and sex aplenty with a hefty dose of gritty science fiction -LRB- they were trying to avoid the too-popular slick Matrix feel with this one , and it shows -RRB- . Does this mess the film up ? It depends on who you ask . People with weak stomachs or who found movies like the Crow too dark and depressing will say `` YES '' . Meanwhile , if you recognize the sex and gore for what it is , it 's quite easy to argue that all they did was amp up what would have been in the story some so the company would gamble and actually let them make a modern opera -LRB- a tall order considering that the art-form is long-dead -RRB- . If you 're looking for something mainstream and Broadway , stick to Dreamgirls or Chicago . Bear in mind , now , Broadway is dying and dozens of productions had to close in the past year . What this film is is a glimpse of the future , though slightly marred by having to pander to the studios to even get it made . In the years to come , expect to see more films and stage shows breaking away from the happy-endings , bursting out in song , and silly dance routines made to sparkle on the screen in favor of more organic-feeling and possibly gritty musical films such as this . Even if this film goes forgotten , the first mark has been made . " ,10
" One of the best things I 've ever seen ! . I had the pleasure of seeing this film in Jackson , MI on one of its last Road Tour stops and I have to admit , I was blown away ! The music is amazing , every character was perfectly cast -LRB- do n't let the presence of Paris Hilton frighten you here folks ! She does a darn fine job in this film ! -RRB- , and most of the effects are disturbingly realistic . And even those effects that are n't perfect do n't detract from the overall arc of the story . At its core , this movie is a tragedy in the same vein as Shakespeare 's `` King Lear '' . It also differs from other movie musicals in that it is presented in true opera form , with only a handful of spoken lines in the whole film and co-creator Terrance Zdunich acting as the narrator of the film in the guise of the GraveRobber . Through him , we learn how the world go to where it is when the story begins . Mr. Zdunich also drew all of the comic-style panels that occur between scenes that explain how some of the individual characters came to be the way they are . The most tragic of these comic-like vignettes -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- is that of Nathan Wallace , played by Anthony Stewart Head of `` Buffy '' fame . Due to an accident -LRB- or was it ? -RRB- , Nathan gives his pregnant wife an incorrect medication , which kills her and forces him to deliver their daughter , Shilo -LRB- Alexa Vega from `` Spy Kids '' -RRB- , by emergency C-section . However , his employer , Rotti Largo -LRB- played by Paul Sorvino ... who knew he could sing like THAT ? -RRB- walks in on the scene and offers him a choice : go to jail for killing his wife , or sign his life away as a `` Repo Man '' for Rotti 's company , GeneCo , which specializes in designer organs . So Nathan has been living a double life since the day of Shilo 's birth : Loving father by day , `` Legal Assassin '' by night . This is only one of the many plots that weave their way through the tapestry of this film . If you like good music , original stories and can handle a bit of blood and gore , check this movie out today ! " ,9
" A breath of fresh air . I feel like Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a film that my friends and I were just waiting for . I 've seen it in theaters 6 times and even though the DVD is out I 'd still see it in the theaters again if it were still playing here . I just ca n't get enough of this movie , it 's like nothing I 've seen before . This is n't a movie that will be embraced by everyone , but Repo seems to have brought together a big group of people which has developed into somewhat of a family . The music is catchy , the visuals are stunning , and the characters are entertaining but it 's the community around the film that makes Repo so special . Repo is something to be experience in a big theater filled with rabid fans singing at the top of their lungs , because it 's not just a movie , it 's an event . " ,10
" Look out for the Repo Man . Nowadays finding a film that 's new and original is impossible at best . Lately all the films are remakes or re imaginings or sequels or retreading an old idea , that 's why Repo is such a relief to the eyes . A very Gothic tale , this is a mix of scary and darkly comic , with a touch of drama and of course very cool songs . Repo is obviously an opera so instantly it is obviously not for everyone , if you hate musicals or operas then this is not for you . It 's also insanely gory -LRB- Scenes of dismemberment are done very well I must say , the Night Surgeon repossession is one of the most gory moments of the movie ... well it and the spine removal -RRB- so if you ca n't stand gore again this is not for you . This is a true cult film , made for one section of society and those that like it will not be disappointed . With stunning performances by the entire cast , including Paris Hilton who actually earns respect for doing this role and not phoning it in . Everyone on screen has great voices , as a fan of the Buffy musical hearing Anthony Stewart Head sing again was a treat . Alexa Vega manages to shake off the sweet girl image from Spy Kids with ease by playing the poor innocent Shilo who goes to hell and back with an incredible voice and some of the most touching moments in the film -LRB- If you do n't at least sniff a tear away during I Did n't Know I 'd Love You So Much then you have no feelings -RRB- . Sarah Brightman stuns with her performance of Chase The Morning and of course Terrance Zdunich , who also co-wrote it , helps us along as the narrator Graverobber and tells us all about how to use Zydrate in an oddly nursery rhyme-like number . The film itself is beautiful to look at , the Gothic look of the film is so wonderfully dark and the colors of the blood and the buildings give the film a rich dark feel that really gives the story the sense of menace it needs . Helping fill in the back-story with comic book like images is genius , it gives us the information needed while doing something different . That 's the wonderful thing about this film , it 's different . I have seen a lot of movies but there just is n't anything out there quite like Repo ! A true original masterpiece that 's a wonder to behold , it 'll change your life ... rest assured " ,10
" Exciting and varying . Repo ! The Genetic Opera . The musical Repo ! The Genetic Opera is mostly a great rock-musical , with sometimes offbeat , even alternative music , and sometimes blood-chilling songs . The movie varies just as much , but in the movie it 's mostly a fight between good and bad scenes . Repo ! starts off promising , a comic-like storytelling and the haunting song ` Genetic Repo Man ' . Following this , we have a short depiction of the most absurd and cruel family in the world : the Largos , who set up a concern of artificial genetics -LRB- Geneco -RRB- and , though saving the world , caused hundreds of millions of people debts , only to be paid by repossessing their organs . We also get some glimpses at Shilo , the protagonist , who has a blood disease , who 's just having her first encounter with the outside world , and Graverobber , making this encounter a trauma to her . Her father , Nathan Wallace , a repo man for Geneco , who claims to Shilo he 's a doctor , convinces her it 's all a dream As the story progresses , we also come by the characters of Blind Mag , Geneco 's voice , and considered the greatest singer of that time and Amber Sweet , Largo 's zydrate -LRB- a futuristic drug -RRB- and surgery addicted daughter , who is working on taking over Meg 's place once she leaves Geneco . We also learn there is a certain thing Mag , Largo and Nathan are bounded with . There are some really good scenes , to name a few , the opening with Genetic Repo Man is a very haunting and atmospheric scene , Legal Assassain is also a very passionate scene , where Anthony Stewart Head gets the best out of himself and his vocal chords . Other good scenes include the preparation for the Genetic Opera , Night Surgeon , Chase the Morning , At the Opera Tonight , Chromaggia -LRB- really thrilling every single time you see it , so lugubrious , yet so beautiful -RRB- , Let the Monster Rise , and the thrilling final scene between Nathan and Shilo , and Shilo 's conclusion . Scenes that really do the movie no good are ` Mark It Up ' , in which to many foolish sound effects and over-the-top body movements were found . Genterns , in which the over-the-top faux-sexualit and almost embarrassingly lesbian-pornographic depiction of the helpers of Pavi and Luigi . Bloodbath ! is a scene of unnecessary narrating , which makes everything more predictable and prevent the audience from thinking themselves . We Started this Opera Sh \* t ! is again very bad for the Genterns who have again an embarrassing , erotic encounter live on stage complete with panting and thrusting . Epitaph is another bad over-the-top moralizing , narrative style , they 'd do a better job transforming the epilogue into such a song , that would make things clear enough . In general , the good scenes are in the majority , and for the artistic side of this movie , and the good music , I tend to give it a 7,5 \/ 10 . " ,8
" Just another review ... . I am very impressed with the amount of excellent information , questions and comments posted on this REPO board . Many points people made were basically right on point and since I love giving my 2-cents I will , cause we might as well use the freedom of speech while it still lasts -LRB- which wo n't be long -RRB- Anyway first qualm with the movie , why was everything had to be sung , I think there were about only 5 lines out of the whole movie that were not sung , this was annoying and funny at times , I know it 's a musical , but I mean everything from `` SHUT UP '' was sung , now how do you sing `` SHUT UP '' just watch this movie and find out The next thing is yes Paris is in it , and yes she does a good job . I know it 's hard to believe but she did n't have to stray from her true life role , a spoiled little brat with to much makeup and plastic surgery . All in all you really have to like Gore Horror and have an appreciation for Musicals , if you like opera then YOU MIGHT appreciate this attempt unless you do not like Gore Horror , but I know very few people who are Horror fans that own Andrea Bocelli CD 'S , this combo is just strange , I know people are comparing this to Rocky Horror , but I would say Rocky Horror is Comedy\/Opera , I would say this is more of a Sweeny Todd , but more gory ... The GRAVEDIGGER I think was the best performer and I would expect so since he was an original writer on this movie , I think his songs were the catchiest , the worst performance would have to be REPO , -LRB- sorry dude you can come after me but my liver is shot anyway -RRB- Overall the weirdness of the movie kept my attention , I liked the multiple character backgrounds , the sets were pretty cool , but there was so much more I wanted to see , it was it was missing something ? More blood ? More action ? Maybe more guns ? It had enough singing and a good amount of gore , maybe Meatloaf would have made the movie ? I just do n't know but it was just missing something that would have really drawn me into this movie and could have possible been on my top ten . I can see this movie having some re-watch value and become more familiar with the music , its almost like buying a CD listening to it once , telling yourself `` IT 'S OK '' then about after the 15 listens , every song is now your favorite , I can see that happening with this movie . Overall I can not recommend this movie because I think everyone will process it differently and I hate recommending cult movies plus I really wanted to love it and just walking away liking it . . Jason Patfield Welcome to Dreadville Series " ,7
" All debts are paid at the opera tonight Repo ! The Genetic Opera . Blood , gore , goth , and opera ? If Darren Lynn Bousman is behind the camera , yes , they meld together into a passion project for all to experience . He can thank the success of the Saw franchise , which he directed three installments , for allowing him to get the financing and support to put Repo ! The Genetic Opera into theaters , -LRB- even if it did n't come to my hometown -RRB- . The middle third of a planned trilogy of rock-horror , the film takes place in a future where genetically created organs are mass-produced and financed to even the poorest surgery-junkies around , with the caveat that if you miss a payment , your very life will be repossessed . Inhabited by freaks and monsters , the city is a cesspool of greed and violence , lorded over by the Largo family and their ownership of GeneCo meaning they hold the life and death of almost everyone in their hands . Only one girl can possibly instill change , the daughter of the Repoman himself , a young woman unable to go outside due to a blood disease , the father made to kill and retrieve organs by blackmail and a lie that has shaped his life for seventeen years . The crux of the tale hinges on the relationship between Rotti Largo , the founder of GeneCo , and Nathan Wallace , his ex-doctor and presumed heir to the throne -LRB- the Largo children are all headcases , unable to run a company -RRB- , current Repoman and thief of Largo 's love . Marni is the woman that fell in love with Nathan , breaking off her relationship with Rotti , marrying the doctor and bearing his child , Shilo . After she fell ill while pregnant , Nathan did all he could to cure her , even taking a medication from his friend and employer , not knowing Rotti had given him a poison to get revenge on the woman who left him . With Marni dead , Nathan thinking himself a murderer , and Shilo born , Wallace decides to imprison his daughter from leaving the house , shielding her from the horrors of the outside world and from his job as the most well-known monster alive . And it 's all done through song . Say what you will about the film I 'm a little mixed on it myself but do not deny the absolute imagination and courage that went into actually making it happen . There was no way that Repo ! would ever be commercially viable . From the start , if it were to succeed at all , it would be as a cult classic , taken possession by late night theaters and the eccentric people who frequent them . Does it have the staying power of a Rocky Horror Picture Show ? I 'm not too sure , but then I ca n't believe the Tim Curry vehicle does , so who knows ? I 'll admit that the music itself is n't anything too memorable , the hard rock\/industrial beats are fantastic , but the lyrics , while good for progressing the plot , end up being a bit disjointed , not rhyming often and choppy in their delivery . But , again , just the attempt of something this ambitious must be applauded . Bousman has truly created a world that aesthetically demands your attention . The detail in the dark , metallic\/computerized world is inventive and intriguing to behold . From the costumes , to the piles of bodies , to the character development of changing faces , to the stage shows of murder , there is a lot going on and your eyes will be assaulted with visual after visual , not a break in sight . With a mixture of drama and camp , the disgusting mixes with the absurd for some fantastic setpieces . I can not stop thinking of an early scene in the graveyard , Shilo , leaving the indoors to catch an insect , stumbling upon the Graverobber and the police and Repoman chasing after him . The fog and grime , juxtaposed with Terrance Zdunich 's voice , -LRB- by far the best of the bunch , very creepy -RRB- , add suspense and wonder from his confidence of not getting caught and her fear that she will . And the falling into a pile of dead bodies on the other side of a stone wall adds to the look as well . As far as the acting goes , it 's a mixed bag too . I really liked Alexa Vega as Shilo , she plays the young girl wanting to be free nicely , and loved Anthony Stewart Head as Nathan\/Repoman . His constant transformation from father\/doctor to monster\/killer is great oh what the removal of glasses and slick-backed hair can do to your image , especially when your eyes gain a menacing glint . Definitely the strongest of the bunch , I was captivated by his conflicted self , trying his best to be the father his daughter needs while also punishing himself for what he thinks he did to his wife . As for the rest , I have to admit to enjoying the Largo family , if still thinking they were all horrible . Paul Sorvino is the only person doing an operatic voice and it is out of place ; his children are just plain weird . Containing the most campy and hammy performances , the utter absurdity of Paris Hilton 's Amber , Ogre 's face-changing Pavi , and Bill Moseley 's over-the-top psychopath Luigi bring a smile to your face for the laughs , but also a grimace due to the unpolished deliveries . I have to say , that while it did n't blow me away as I hoped it would , Repo ! is very much worth a visit . Hoping the next two installments do get made , I hope the writers may get them a bit more flowing musically . Bousman definitely has the aesthetic down , complete with the comic book cut scenes and flashbacks . Disturbing , yes ; entertaining , of course despite the subject matter ; complete success , maybe not quite . The makings for cult status are there ; hopefully Bousman can continue creating inventively creepy films . If nothing else , he has an eye to make the disgustingly vile look beautiful . " ,7
" Everybody ! Everybody ! Testify ! RTGO Is Amazing Entertainment . . testify ! this movie is so incredibly entertaining and thought provoking , it really gets inside of you like a transplanted organ you need to live . i love musicals , mostly the underground types or the off the cuff kind . those of you who dig know those . musicals like ` Rocky ' , or ` Reefer Madness ' , ` Cannibal ; the musical ' , ` Little shop ' and of course Oingo Boingo 's ` Forbidden Zone ' . those off the mainstream musicals have dominated the underground zone in the musical genre for so long and justifiably , but it 's so nice to welcome a newcomer to that list . especially one as great as this . this was so awesome i do n't even know where to begin . the music , acting and production were all so superior and on the highest level of anything i have seen in entertainment in years . first . Paul Sorvino is amazing . i heard he did some opera singing for a hobby or something but i had no idea he could do this . his voice and acting skills combined make this the most powerful performance i have seen in years . after this i will never trust the Oscar show again . he should have been recognized , nominated , and should have won the Oscar award that year . Sorvino 's performance reminded me a little of Meryl Streep in ` Mama Mia ' . at geriatric 60 , Streep showed us you can still be bouncy , cute and sexy . quite a feat for a 60 year old chick . in ` Repo ' , Sorvino proves you can be geriatric , over 60 , and still rock like Cooper , Bowie , or Osbourne . he is just out of the solar system with this performance . great great gush gush ! Sarah Brightman is , as usual , a real gift . but i never knew she could tear up the scenery like this . as ill-fated character Blind Mag , she is pure , classic , cinema horror . like Boris Karloff . In ` Repo ' , Brightman is Boris Karloff . her role requires her to wear sinister make-up and shoot scary holograms from her all - seeing eyeballs . but it 's the actress herself that gives such an incredible performance that it comes through all the make up and effects . that was Karloff . he wore costumes like the Mummy or Frankie-Stein , but the actor always came through all the effects . in this horror musical i kind of thought the most disturbing thing was that Paris Hilton was outstanding . i never thought i 'd say that . but she is . as Amber Sweet the heiress -LRB- i know what ironic casting -RRB- , she does all her own singing and dance moves and she 's just awesome . i always thought Hilton was a typical celeb . a joke . not here . i never thought i 'd see the day when Paris would sing with a great like Sarah Brightman , but it happened , and it was no joke . i could go on endlessly about this movie and even how it is helping to save my sanity , my life , right now.i could go on endlessly about the whole , brilliant , cast , Alexa Vega , Anthony Stewart Head -LRB- who 's character looks like the film 's director -RRB- , and of course the brilliant Terrance Zdunich , who without him , we would have no opera . but there 's no room on IMDb . someone should try a serious review in Film Quarterly .

" An amazing , modern opera unlike anything else out there . . Some people rip on the over the top nature of the songs in this film . Others criticize the over the top acting . Others claim it puts too much effort into trying to be edgy . The people that make this claim have never watched an opera aside from Repo . Its SUPPOSED to be over the top , overly dramatized and , at times , the songs are meant to be caricatures . When Shiloh sings about being seventeen and how its better than being 40 , she is SUPPOSED to sound like a whiny seventeen year old complaining about dad 's rules ... because that 's what she is doing . Since its an opera , she expresses this through song . If you do n't like people expressing the nature of their problems , characters , etc. through song , you do n't like opera and probably should n't be reviewing one . That said , for fans of the genre , this movie is amazing . Anthony Stewart Head and Sarah Brightman steal the show . Heck , even Paris Hilton puts on a solid performance . The grave robber takes on an almost Puck-like role and poor Shiloh comes across as a ` real ' teenager through the writer 's willingness to have her act like one even if its going to get people rolling their eyes . The visuals are gory . If you do n't enjoy horror\/gore this may not be the film for you . But as a horror fan who enjoys a bit , I found out thoroughly entertaining at some points , and even limit-pushing at others . The ending was one of the best I 've seen in a musical in awhile . Pure , operatic genius . It was n't afraid to be both classical in its execution and modern in its storytelling . The actors really shine through here and the brilliance of the script shows through . This movie requires a certain type of fan . I 'm not a ` goth ' . I 'm not trying to be ` edgy . ' But I do love music , enjoy horror films and appreciate a good , tragic , well-written story . As such , I found this movie to be amazing , pure and simple . The acting is intense . The music goes from beautiful to horrifying to , on occasion , comedic . The visuals are stunning and whoever thought up this vision of the future is a genius . If you 're not someone who hates operas , someone who ca n't see a goth without getting immediately annoyed , or someone who ca n't handle gore , watch this movie . Maybe you 'll like it . Maybe you wo n't . But one thing 's for sure - you 'll never see anything else like it . " ,10
" A Great Film , For it 's Audience , Repo ! Astounds . Repo ! is not so much a film as it is something you experience . A heady blend of rock , opera , comic books , sci-fi , horror , and goth aesthetic . And while it 's not for everyone , it has an audience . And I 'm betting a larger one than most realize . First off , this is an Opera . A good , proper Opera , worth a capital O. It comes with all the trappings of an Opera ; elaborate , almost melodramatic plot , larger than life characters and nearly every word is sung . Or sing-talked . This does n't bother me , but it might be a little odd to people who are n't expecting it . -LRB- For instance , the line : How am I going to find my way home ? is sung . And that 's the whole song , by the way . -RRB- With everything being sung , it is possible for the entire thing to blend together , into one endless and not very good song . However , there are sufficient songs in various styles to bring a sense of variety . So , even though they never stop singing between scenes , one scene will be pop , the next pure opera , the next rock and so on . And there are some genuinely good songs on the offer here . Chromaggia is a haunting aria , Seventeen a fun punk rock song and I defy not to hum Zydrate Anatomy for days after you see this film . And that simply is the tip of the iceberg . In a movie with so much singing , it all depends on the vocal work , which does not disappoint . Alexa Vega as Shilo has a pleasing voice , and it works well with what is expected of her . However , truly dazzling are the likes of Paul Sorvino as Rotti Largo , who shows off his operatic chops . Anthony Head as Nathan , Shilo 's father , demonstrates that in some alternate reality he might have been in a rock band , had he turned away from acting . And of course , Sarah Brightman is great as Blind Mag , the famous opera singer about to give her last performance . But then , that is hardly shocking , as she is Sarah Brightman . No , shocking for the first time viewer is the Graverobber , played with undeniable finesse by absurdly talented Terrance Zudunich . Terrance is the co-creator of the stage play Repo ! was based on , co-writer of the film , acts in it , can sing very well , and even drew all the art that goes into the comic book animatics the film uses to explain the character 's back stories . Oh , and he steals every scene he 's in , acting as an ethereal narrator , involved in the films events and yet also observing . He breaks the forth wall eventually , and it works only because it was this character . And that voice of his . Now , I love deep voices , and he hits one low note I can hardly believe , ironically on the word ` low ' in the song 21st Century Cure . Now , the plot Graverobber provides the narration for tells the tale two families . The Largos , headed by Rotti Largo the man who save a dying world . Organ failure became an epidemic in this future , and Rotti began a company that supplied organs on credit , but do n't fall back on your payments . Organs are subject to repossession . Rotti is dying , and must choose a successor from his three horrible children . The other family is that of Nathan and Shilo , Nathan an overprotective father to his daughter , who has a rare blood disease . He never lets her outside . So , of course , to set the plot in motion , she gets out . And goes on a journey uncovering the dark secrets about herself , her father 's job , his past , and his connection to the Largo family . This film is dark , bloody and not for the faint of heart . Even the comic relief characters are a murderer and rapist . But , if you do n't mind gore , and love rock as well as imaginative visuals and story , this one is for you . Sure , there are a few minor plot holes , a few musical numbers that seem to happen for no good reason beyond the fact they are completely awesome . This is the sort of film you need to allow to sweep you up , to inundate you with it 's peculiar and original vision . And if you do so , you wo n't notice any of these . View it as art , as gaudy , beautiful , spectacle , and you should adore it . This film is a labor of love by it 's creators and that is evident in it 's every second . And frankly , if I wrote something as good as Zydrate Anatomy , I 'd contrive a way to get my characters into an alleyway and to give them a chance to sing it , too . \* a note \* If you are avoiding the film due to the presence of a certain person in it , you are missing out on an incomparable experience . And by the way , she 's actually quite good in this . If you know what I 'm talking about , you 'll get this , if not , I don '' t want to prejudice new viewers . " ,9
" Dark and delightfully morbid . Although I am not much of a musical fan , I picked this up because Bill Mosely is in it , and also because it looked frigging interesting from the cover alone . Alright , well on to it . The story is fairly interesting and quite captivating . There is something wonderfully morbid to the concept of having repo guys collecting body parts when you fail to pay up . The scenery and atmosphere throughout the entire movie was nice . It was very dark and brooding , and it worked really well for the movie . There were lots of nice details all over , and it is obvious that they put a lot of effort into this . There is just enough amount of humor and gore in this musical to give it a really good twist . The cast ? Well they were well enough casted , the actors did a good job in portraying their characters , through acting and singing alike . I , personally , though , would have liked to see more of Bill Mosely here . If you like The Rocky Horror Picture Show , then you should most definitely pick up Repo and check it out . I am a fan of the former and I came to enjoy the latter as well . " ,7
" WOW , all i can say is WOW . this is the best musical ever made and i ai n't usually into musicals bust this film really hit me . its magnificent and everyone should watch it just to give it a chance ... . OK the film might be a tad cheap but that is the only thing wrong with it . i think if they put a little more money into the production of this it would of made a huge impact on a lot of people . the cast are a little unknown if you ai n't a true fan of film ... it has Anthony Stewart Head as the Repo man Anthony is in Buffy the vampire slayer as Giles and is n't really in much more than that . he plays his character amazingly and his singing is brilliant too . then again all the actors in this film are really good at showing there emotions through song . so the casting is spot on . Alexa Vega from spy kids , Bill Moseley from devils rejects , Paul Sorvino from Goodfellas and Paris Hilton are among the cast . Paris Hilton is brilliant in this film too strangely enough . i think what got me about this film was a lot of things , the violence mixed with singing is a humorous combination , the darkness and gritty look of this film pulled me in and most importantly this film has a lot of power to it ... . you really have feelings for the characters . once again Darren Lynn Bousman has done it again , his directing in the saw films is brilliant and now hes branching of to do other films and i hope he does well ... ... 10\/10 ... ... j.d Seaton " ,10
" One of the best movies I 've ever seen . . Repo ! was one of the best movies I 've seen in a long time . Gory without being a two-hour , plot less blood fest , musical without being cheesy , suspenseful without being aggravating , dramatic without being melodramatic , Repo ! has it all ! I personally loved the way they used comics to tell the stories of the characters ' pasts , rather than alluding to the past and forcing the audience to try and guess what they are talking about . Usually I can guess the ending of a movie from the first five minutes , but Repo ! was totally original . I RARELY give ratings that are all good , but to Repo ! I give ten stars and two thumbs , and ca n't wait for the road tour to make it to Arizona ! " ,10
" `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' is a Tour-de-Force of music , mayhem and more ! This is a film not to be missed , destined to become a modern cult classic ! . From director Darren Lynn Bousman -LRB- `` Saw II '' , `` III '' and `` IV '' -RRB- comes the long-awaited adaptation of the Terrance Zdunich and Darren Smith 's stage-play `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera . '' And in every possible way the film lived up to -LRB- and often exceeded -RRB- the expectations that had built for well over a year since I first heard of its production . We all know the back-story - in the not-too-distant future , an epidemic of organ failures sweeps the world , killing millions and crumbling society to dust . The wealthy Largo family , led by patriarch father Rotti Largo -LRB- the magnificent Paul Sorvino -RRB- , created a new way to save the citizens of the world - Organ Rental programs for people who could not afford complex operations . Now , so long as you keep your payments for your transplants up to date , you 're fine . But miss a payment , and the Largos are forced to send out a Repo-man to repossess their property - and end your life ! That is the vague back-story upon which the film is based , but really , the film tells many interweaving stories . The most important of these is the story of Shilo Wallace -LRB- Alexa Vega , now very sexy post `` Spy Kids '' -RRB- , a young girl suffering from an unnamed blood disease , that is kept locked away in her bedroom by her father Nathan Wallace -LRB- the under-appreciated Anthony Head -RRB- . Nathan is keeping Shilo locked away so she is not exposed to the corrupt world that lay outside her window . He is also still mourning the death of his wife , which he feels partly responsible for , and simply ca n't let his daughter , the last piece of his late wife on this world , go . Very powerful stuff goes on with this story , especially after it is revealed early on the Nathan is one of the dreaded Repo-men , and has been using pull from working for Rotti Largo to keep this a secret from Shilo . The second story is the story of Rotti himself , and a complex plan for revenge he concocts after learning he is dying from a terminal illness . This is a multi-layered story , as not only is he going to use his last days to exact an ultimate revenge on Nathan -LRB- for reasons I wo n't list myself -RRB- , but also it creates tension within his clan of psychotic children - Pavvi -LRB- a face-stealing rapist played by Ogre from the band Skinny Puppy in a truly good and fiendishly amusing performance -RRB- ; Luigi -LRB- Horror Icon Bill Mosely in another knockout role as a violent thug -RRB- and finally Amber Sweet -LRB- a surgery-obsessed brat who always wants her way , and is addicted to a potent street drug called Zydrate ; played by Paris Hilton -RRB- . Now , I know you all want to gag when I say Paris Hilton is in this movie , but let me assure you , her role is actually well-played , and she comes off as a decent actress . Forget all the media hype about her , and forget who she is , because she actually nails this role with a degree of perfection . Sure , it 's not an Oscar-worthy performance , but as someone who has generally negative feelings towards Hilton , even I was pleasantly surprised by her and was not bothered in the least . -LRB- Do n't listen to her Razzie nomination and win - they obviously have n't seen the film if they nominated her . -RRB- Along the way , we meet other zany characters , including a figure from Nathan and Shilo 's past - Blind Mag -LRB- the stunningly beautiful Sarah Brightman in her major film debut -RRB- , a Graverobber who helps Shilo every now and then and later becomes a narrator for the final act of the story -LRB- co-writer Terrance Zdunich , proving he has acting chops -RRB- , and many others . Now we get to what no review of an opera could be complete without mentioning - the music ! The music in `` Repo ! '' -LRB- By Smith and Zdunich -RRB- is generally outstanding in every way , shape and form . The lyrics are expertly crafted -LRB- and while some lyrics are on the clich side , I did n't mind -RRB- , the music itself is astonishing and very diverse -LRB- covering everything from a jazzy sound to punk to goth-rock to any other kind you could think of -RRB- , and the singing on everyone 's part -LRB- particularly Sorvino and Head -RRB- is as close to perfection as you can get . And this is a movie with a lot of songs -LRB- last I checked , there were around 50 songs in this movie -RRB- , so you 'd be hard-pressed to find at least a few you did n't love . -LRB- I know some of my favorites include `` Gold '' , `` Mark it Up '' , `` Chase the Morning '' and others -RRB- Now , before we wrap this up , I suppose I should mention some of the film 's very few down-points to keep this more neutral . For one , it was painfully obvious in watching this film that a large amount of material was cut , and I have since heard that the original version lasted over 2 hours . However , courtesy of LionsGate -LRB- which has been making a string of horrible choices lately -RRB- , we have only a 97-minute version . Hopefully someday we 'll get a director 's cut . Also , some characters -LRB- particularly Pavvi and Luigi , the film 's dark comedic relief -RRB- are underused , which is frustrating given the talent involved . But overall , these complaints are a speck of dust compared to the bigger picture - which is that `` Repo ! '' rocks ! Overall , I give `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' a 9 out of 10 for thrills , chills and fun ! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes a good , gory and zany time . " ,9
" Phenomenal ! Repo is original , exciting , and a breath of fresh air . . I first saw Repo ! When it premiered in Atlanta , and I was instantly addicted . I could hardly wait for it to come out on DVD so I could get my hands on a copy . It 's extremely entertaining , and highly original . The artistic quality of the movie amazes me , and it was definitely more than I expected from the director of the saw movies . Although somewhat bloody and violent , there is an enrapturing , unique story behind the gore . The music in incredibly catchy , and you 'll be left with the songs in your head long after you 've seen the film . Along with originality and excellent composure , the score has a great variety of genres of music . Whether it be classical , rock , or a little more pop , each song fits the story perfectly . The cast is absolutely stunning together . Never in my life would I have imagined seeing Paris Hilton , Ogre , Sarah Brightman , Paul Sorvino , or Bill Moseley in the same movie , or for them to make it WORK . But they do , and it 's fantastic . They become their roles , and have produced something amazing . Hats off to Darren , Terrance , Darren Smith , and the rest of the cast and crew of REPO ! . They set out to do something that has n't been done before , and they succeeded . They 've created something new , original , and beautiful . Despite all the people who said they could n't pull it off . Repo is what we need . Something that is n't cookie-cutter , a mold breaker . I 'm tired of seeing the same old thing . This is the first movie I have seen in a long time that I can honestly say I truly love . A movie does n't have to be done the same traditional way to be good . And Repo only proves that . Support Creativity , Originality . Support Repo ! The Genetic Opera . " ,10
" This is n't just a movie , its an event ! . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is more than just a movie , more than just gore and beautiful music . Its an event , a party , a movie that brings out a wide range of emotions in its viewers . There 's never been a movie with such a wildly enthusiastic fan base ! The costumes and sets are gorgeous , capturing a world where people have gone mad with surgery to make themselves beautiful while their city decays around them . Musically , Repo ! draws from a large range of influences , the songs are by turn heartbreaking , comedic , or hopeful and the actors carry it off perfectly . See Repo ! , get your friends to see Repo ! Go dress up , sing and enjoy yourselves ! " ,10
" The most original thing I 've seen in years . There are those who would say the lyrics are campy . There are those who would say the movie lacks something . For these people there are other things to watch . truth be told Repo : The Genetic Opera has made me happy . I have drug just over 30 people to see the film , and each has left with the same results . A huge smile and a desire to see it again . I have to say whomever decided there was n't an audience for this had n't looked out there window in a few decades . I ca n't say much without spoiling the story . I can explain what everyone already knows . It 's the future , it 's a rock Opera , and it has one hell of a cast . The story is captivating . The story layers are amazing . The music is smooth and the singing is terrific . I say keep up the good word guys . I loved this movie . " ,10
" Forget The Critics ! . Some Critics have rated this movie as the worst , and let 's be honest , that ranking belongs with the unimaginative , stale , half-witted movies such as `` Date Movie '' `` Epic Movie '' `` Scary Movie 35 '' franchise . I 'm going to let you in on a secret , the Critics are the lap-dogs of Hollywood ! The critics do n't care about legitimately ranking and rating a movie , all they care about is the prestige of their name and\/or the money in their wallets . Besides , why should you let some random person , who has never met you , decide your movies ? This movie has something that movies coming out of Hollywood do n't seem to have , that is an ORIGINAL story ! If you are tired of all of the remakes and books turned to movies , then take a chance on Repo ! If you are open to true cinema , and not the mainstream drivel coming out of Hollywood , then this is the movie for you . " ,10
" Very interesting . . If you ca n't admit that this is a good movie , which I believe it is , you must admit that it is fun to watch . Never have a seen a movie quite like Repo ! The Genetic Opera . This movie is refreshingly original and a great pleasure to watch . Some great scenery and effects are used to make your movie-going experience memorable . It is also very cleverly written and definitely worth the price of that expensive ticket ! If you liked Sweeney Todd , you will definitely like this one . Great acting all around by the main characters . To name a few , Alexa Vega was superb as Shiloh , and Anthony Stewart Head was also great as the repo man . My favorite character would have to be the grave robber . Most of the songs are very catchy , might I add . I am embarrassed to say that I bought a few of the songs off of iTunes . A great movie experience ! " ,9
" I had no idea a film could be THIS entertaining . . Hands down Repo ! is the most entertaining film I can recall ever watching . A bold statement I know but man is this film fun to experience . Decorated with a beautifully dark , Gothic , and gruesome atmosphere this film is visually stunning . The music at first felt a little forced but perhaps that 's because I 'm just not well acquainted with musicals . Having said that the music turned out to be one of my favorite aspects of the film . The songs are powerful , clever , and very well written . Each number more catchy than the last . I am writing this review just days before the DVD is scheduled to release and although there is shockingly little buzz surrounding it 's release , I predict Repo ! will become wildly popular with a strong cult following . I 'll be a strong supporter and recommend it to anyone I know . Movies are meant to entertain and this little film just set the standard up to unthinkable heights . ~ PGDGM ~ " ,10
" Thought It Was Brilliant . I thought this film was actually really good . All the actors and singers were amazing . Even Paris was amazing i know some people think she cant sing and so on but if you watch it she actually does a decent job of singing and acting as Amber Sweet and i do n't think they could have got anyone better to play that character . The story is pretty good was a bit confusing at the beginning but by the end i knew what was going on . I think people should give it a chance and see it for what it really is . A fun Gothic musical . And a plus side it has a really good soundtrack i went out and bought it i liked it so much ! Recommend it to people . Just give it a chance . " ,10
" Caution : Movie may be as addictive as Zydrate itself ! . What can I say about this movie ? Well the real question is what ca n't I say about this movie . Repo ! has easily become my favorite movie of all time . I simply ca n't stop watching it . The songs are completely addictive I find myself playing the movie just to hear the songs . The best ting about Repo ! is that it is completely original . I 've never seen a film like it before . The visuals are like no other as are the songs . This movie is not for everyone however , virtually the entire film is sung . In my opinion that is what makes the film so great , more like watching a performance than a movie . The best experience for seeing Repo ! is in the theater with other Repo ! fans . The fan base for the movie , aka the Repo ! family , is what has drawn me in so much . " ,10
" I never thought I 'd love you so much . . I saw Repo for the first time less than a week ago , expecting to adore it -LRB- based on the trailer -RRB- . I did n't ; I hated it : the songs , Alexa Vega 's performance , the ending ... and the few scenes I did like could not make up for my disappointment . But it stayed in my head - I researched it and the people involved , went on the message boards , saw how in love people were with it , found the soundtrack , ended up playing it a dozen times repeatedly ... and I just saw it again today . And I loved it . Every second of it . Repo is not for everyone . A musical about organ transplants ? Sounds like a joke , right ? Most of the songs are based around what seems like four or five notes ; the characters , in typical musical and comic book fashion , are fairly one-dimensional ; the dialogue and song lyrics are sometimes painfully melodramatic ; the gore is abundant ... yes , this will have critics spitting . But the film is so shameless in its exaggerated melodrama , its overdone gore , that it becomes incredibly fun to watch . Seeing it for the second time , I looked past everything I disliked : I just went with it . And I had never enjoyed anything so much in my life . I wo n't talk about the story ; I think that plot is secondary to something like this . More important , I think , is the atmosphere , and the atmosphere here is exquisite . The cinematography , sets and editing are quite unforgettable . The details of the alternate reality it builds up are by turns terrifying and hysterically funny . But the cast here is key . Had it been different , the film might have fallen apart , but the actors here are truly wonderful , very funny and , as diverse as their backgrounds are , they work brilliantly together . They transform their caricature-like characters into memorable and vivid creations . The most notable are Terrance Zdunich and his Graverobber , Paris Hilton 's Amber Sweet -LRB- you have to see it to believe it -RRB- and the always incomparable Anthony Head . They alone are worth watching the film for . However , I enjoyed the other performances well - all but Alexa Vega 's . Technically , she 's the main character of the film , but the flaws in her one-note -LRB- in every way -RRB- performance are easy to ignore when she 's surrounded by so many fascinating actors and characters . Many things about this film are frustrating , or will be to first-time viewers : the sing-talk is difficult to get used to ; the story is predictable , and the ends get tied up far too nicely ; the screenplay is hilariously ridiculous ; the humor is blatant , very in-your-face , some may say tasteless , and there is much gore . The way I see it now , though , the key to watching this movie is not to take it seriously . If taken seriously , of course Repo will seem pretentious , repetitive , gratuitously gory , dull , uninvolving , and so on and so forth . But it 's actually a very funny and accurate parody of musicals , slasher films , comic books , and even makes some startlingly real points about society -LRB- particularly plastic surgery -RRB- . It does n't oversaturate itself by pretending to be original . It is simply shameless in everything from its music to its gore to its camp . If you like straight-forward , realistic , emotional , normal films , this might not be for you . But if you like gore , camp , bizarre people and characters , leather and sharp objects , original music , if you want to see Paris Hilton and Sarah Brightman actually act , if you have an ounce of respect Anthony Head and want to hear him sing again after Once More With Feeling -- this is for you . If you feel like discovering a new world , dozens of incredibly addictive and fun songs , and becoming part of an unbelievably dedicated fanbase , see it . Maybe you still wo n't like it ... but maybe you will . Either way , I promise you will remember it . Darren Lynn Bousman advised everyone , even those that hated it , to write a review for Repo somewhere . So I did . And from what I can tell , the criticism he 's facing right now for this film is the exact same criticism that was faced by Jim Sharman for Rocky Horror - and look where that got it . But Repo is flashier , grittier , bloodier , campier , and infinitely more atmospheric . And ... Terrance Zdunich over Tim Curry any day . " ,10
" More than 100 % recommended ! . After meeting Anthony Head when I used to work at a movie theater here in town and then finding out he was working on this at that time , Repo ! has become a fixation of mine . That was almost a year and a half ago , and in that time , I 've seen it twice , both during Toronto After Dark , and again when it kicked off it 's week - long run at the Bloor Cinema , and both times , it blew me away how amazing it was . The acting is stellar , to the point where more than once I forgot that the characters were just that : characters being portrayed by actors . The soundtrack had me singing along the whole film , and I 'm more than certain I was n't the only one doing so . Repo ! definitely brings you into it 's world from the very start , and hold you until the very end , and even then , it refuses to let go . But then again , I do n't think any of the other fans I know of would want it to let go anyways , so it 's a win-win situation . " ,10
" Great music , great acting , even Paris Hilton does an amazing job . Check it out . I recently attended the Toronto premiere of Repo ! The Genetic Opera , and I have to say that after waiting about a year for this movie , I was not disappointed . The beginning of the movie is presented to us a comic book , describing how organ failures around the globe killed millions , until a company , GeneCo , was able to produce replacement organs for a price . Those who could not afford new organs were sold them on credit , but if they fell behind in their payments , an organ repo man would violently reclaim GeneCo 's property . Although the comics and flashbacks get a little tiresome , this movie is well worth seeing for the awesome songs and amazing acting . While the cast ca n't be considered `` all-star , '' every actor pulls out all the stops to deliver a memorable performance -LRB- yes , even Paris Hilton -RRB- . I particularly enjoyed Anthony Stewart Head 's portrayal of the loving , if overprotective , father Nathan Wallace , and his alter ego , the sinister Repo Man . When I would hear Nathan 's soothing tones one second , and Repo Man 's gravelly voice the next , it really helped me to understand the character 's inner turmoil . So yeah , I 'm not very good at this whole review thing , and in fact the only reason I joined IMDb was to tell people to go see Repo ! . If even Paris Hilton does an amazing job , does n't that speak volumes about the quality of this movie ? " ,9
" Repo ! The Genetic Opera Review from GoneWithTheTwins.com ! . `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' may be this generation 's answer to `` The Rocky Horror Picture Show . '' It 's a gory rock opus so over the top that it oozes pure camp , and it proudly snubs its nose at anything that looks , feels , and sounds realistic . It creates a world of its own , a harsh , shadowy , technological universe in which everyone is obsessed with body image . Even though the story takes place in the year 2056 , we 're not really presented with a vision of the future ; it 's more a vision of an alternate reality , one in which narcotics can be extracted from dead bodies and faces can be transplanted with the same ease as changing Halloween masks . For nearly 100 minutes , we 're completely immersed in a grungy , gritty fantasy world of floating billboards and dirty back alleys , bloody operation rooms and crowded concert halls . Director Darren Lynn Bousman , mostly known for his disappointing `` Saw '' sequels , has crafted a film that not only exceeds all stylistic expectations , but also tells a story we can willingly suspend disbelief for . For everything this movie achieves on a contemporary level , it is , in the strictest sense , a classic opera . There 's more to it than being almost entirely sung through -- it 's a drama filled with secrets , betrayal , and deception , and even though it wallows in buckets of blood and piles of human organs , it manages to strike a chord as a compelling tragedy . The foundation of the plot is laid out with expository comic book panels , which occasionally appear throughout the film : In the not-too-distant future , an epidemic of organ failure plunged the world into chaos . Out from the darkness came GeneCo , a biotech company that offered hope with the promise of financed organ transplants . If a patient ca n't repay in the time allotted , however , the organs are seized by ruthless Repo Men , assassins who prowl the streets wearing Hazmat-like suits and bizarre goggled helmets . From this came an epidemic of addiction to a glowing-blue drug called Zydrate , given to plastic surgery patients as a painkiller . Grave robbers , such as the film 's pseudo-narrator -LRB- Terrance Zdunich -RRB- , have made a name for themselves by extracting the drug from corpses and selling it on the streets . This brings me to the actual plot , a simple and disgusting story of family secrets , jealous lovers , and revenge schemes . Many characters are involved . One is Shilo Wallace -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- , a seventeen-year-old girl sick with a rare blood disorder she believes she inherited from her dead mother . Because of her disease , she 's confined to her room . Shilo 's father , Nathan -LRB- Anthony Stewart Head -RRB- , blames himself for his wife 's death , and as a result , he 's immensely overprotective of Shilo . Unbeknownst to Shilo , he 's also a Repo Man ; he works for Rotti Largo -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- , the dying patriarch of GeneCo . Rotti 's grown children can probably be considered comedy relief , or at least the closest thing to comedy relief : his daughter , Amber Sweet -LRB- Paris Hilton -RRB- , is a spoiled plastic surgery addict who wants to be a singer ; his two sons , Pavi -LRB- Ogre -RRB- and Luigi -LRB- Bill Moseley -RRB- , constantly bicker over who will inherit GeneCo when their father dies . These last two are interesting characters in and of themselves . Pavi speaks with a French accent and has a woman 's face stapled over his own . Luigi is a hothead who occasionally tears his shirt open , revealing a number of hideous scars . What neither one realize is that Rotti has no intention of giving his company to them . For reasons I wo n't reveal , he shows great interest in Shilo . So does Bling Mag -LRB- Sarah Brightman -RRB- , a pop-opera diva that was born blind but given special electronic eyes by GeneCo . As payment for their services , Mag sings exclusively for the company at their Genetic Opera , the latest of which will see Shilo in attendance . So as not to spoil anything , let 's just say that , during the film 's climactic stage performance , Rotti will offer her a cure in exchange for a favor . The songs , adapted by Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich from their original stage production , may not be as catchy or showstopping as you might expect . While some are orchestrated like heavy metal ballads , many are just sung conversations , having music and lyrics but no consistent melody or rhyme scheme . But keep in mind that this is an opera , not a musical -- while the former completely replaces the spoken word with song , the latter only enhances the spoken word , using songs in strategically placed narrative pauses . Not that it matters a great deal , especially in a story this campy . `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' is not so much fun because it 's set to music , but because it 's an unabashedly strange story filled with strange characters , all of which seem like natural extensions of the actors . Sorvino , Brightman , and Head , with their precise performances and wonderful singing voices , breathe life into their roles . Even Hilton , the very embodiment of over-hyped celebrity , is perfectly cast , with a surprisingly good singing voice to boot . Of course , nothing could stop me from laughing the moment her character 's newly grafted face peeled off . The film 's best character is the GraveRobber , who looks like a freshly unearthed ghoul with his paper-white face and expressive black lips . While only a supporting role , the GraveRobber 's devilish charm and observant nature allows him to contribute significantly to the story . I would expect nothing less from Zdunich , not when he 's one half of the film 's creative team . Moseley and Ogre are not bad either , both delightfully excessive as immature , foulmouthed , surgically butchered brothers . There 's absolutely no shortage of gory fun in `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera , '' a refreshingly original film that can successfully take a disemboweling and set it to music . I have the feeling we 're being introduced to a new cult classic , something audiences will watch repeatedly in packed midnight movie theaters . - Chris Pandolfi " ,9
" In 2056 , organ failure is rampant . Organs can be procured , but on a payment plan . If you ca n't make your payments ... the Repo man will come . . This was a brilliant movie with a marriage of music , gore and diverse actors . Released in limited release , this movie is worth the amount of miles you may have to travel to see it . It has a cast that you would never expect to see together . Paul Sorvino as father to Bill Moseley , Paris Hilton and Ogre from Skinny Puppy . Anthony Head from the Buffy the Vampire series and a Repo man protecting his daughter , Alexa Vega from Spy Kids , from himself and the outside world . Most impressive were the voices of Sarah Brightman and Terrance Zdunich . Talk about amazing ! And let 's not forget Darren Smith , collaborator with Terrance Zdunich to write this masterpiece . All are directed to perfection by Darren Lynn Bousman . The lines for this movie were around the block and the crowd dressed as characters for the occasion . The earlier release of the soundtrack allowed the viewers to warm up in line with their own renditions of the movie which turned into a bit of a sing along once in the movie . As a 47 year old mother , I would load up a bus and take anyone to see this movie . It has something that will have wide appeal to each individual . My 20 year old and 11 year old ca n't stop singing . Once you see it , you 'll want to turn around and see it again , but the sold out crowds may delay that . This is a must see movie for all audiences . " ,10
" This movie rocks ! -LRB- Spoiler free review -RRB- . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a 2008 rock opera-musical horror sci-fi film . It takes place in the future and life is not as sweet as some might think . It turns out there have been a highly overwhelming amount of organ failures and this has really messed things up for the planet , but then comes a multi-billion dollar company called GeneCo to the rescue . These guys provide organ transplantation ... for a pretty big price of course . However , if someone misses a payment , the company will send out `` repo men '' to get you and literally take back organs people bought for themselves . I saw the movie last weekend and I went into it not knowing a thing about the story . I only saw the teaser for it and it told me nothing , but I 'm glad I saw the film with having very little knowledge about it because it made it more entertaining in my view . Speaking of entertainment , this is by far the most entertaining movie I have seen this year . An extra treat in the flick is that cult horror movie icon Bill Mosely is in it . He plays the part of a gentleman named Luigi Largo . This is the third movie Mosely has done where he is a character that is a member of a rather deranged family , and good ol' Bill once again plays the same kind of role that made him famous : A crazy guy with a foul temper ! Robert De Niro became the legend that he is for playing various mafia bosses , Jim Carrey is well known for his comedies and Bill Mosely is loved by his fans for playing crazy men in horror movies . To each their own , and Bill is so brilliant that he is able to add his own uniqueness to each character that he plays , so his role in Repo wo n't remind you of any of his other performances . He is also a very good singer who can carry a very good tune ! Now while the overall feel of the film is dark , Bill is very much the comic relief of the film and has many memorable lines that will no doubt be often quoted by his fan base . He sadly does n't have a very large role in the movie , but that just makes one appreciate his presence more when he shows up on the screen . Sara Brightman is still as beautiful as she ever was , and is still the angel of music . She also still has the same power and fire in her voice that she has always had , and you can tell she still loves to sing . If you 're a fan of her 's , you will enjoy seeing her in Repo . Paris Hilton is a very beautiful young woman and she did very well with her acting and singing . She looked great , and I have nothing negative to say about her . It 's a shame that some people will refuse to see the movie all because of her . I 'd like to know what exactly she has done to make people hate her so much . I ca n't help but think that most people hate her out of pure jealousy . She literally lives the life most of us can only dream about . But it 's fine to be envious . I 've been highly jealous of some performers too , and sometimes I just hate them and do n't understand why they are famous . But I still do n't boycott the films they are in . If it looks like a good movie , I 'll see it . Anyhow , Paris Hilton does n't have some big role in the movie so even if you hate her , please do n't let her being in the film stop you from seeing it if that 's your ONLY reason for not wanting to watch it . Paul Sorvino was also very good in the film and proved to have a good singing voice . The rest of the cast was great as well , and all had very good singing voices and acting skills in my view . Some have also thought that the movie would be a rip-off of The Rocky Horror Picture Show , but trust me ... it 's not . It has the same dark and sometimes wacky feel that RHPS has ... but other then that , they are nothing alike . I really love the music in the film and ca n't wait to get the soundtrack . All and all , I think Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a great film . If you love such movies as The Rocky Horror Picture Show , Blade Runner , Sin City , the Saw films , the Hostel flicks and Tim Burton movies ... then I think you 'll also love Repo ! The Genetic Opera . Being a fan of the horror and\/or rock opera and musical genre will help increase your love for it too . As would being a Bill Mosely fan . :-D I look forward to buying and listening to the soundtrack , and buying the movie on blu-ray . While I think it 's great to watch any time of the years , I think it 'll be extra great to watch next Halloween ! Thanks for reading ! " ,10
" breath of fresh air . . repo wastes no time engulfing you in its dark stylish universe colored with a Gothic wardrobe and choreographed to a beautifully composed industrial rock soundtrack featuring music akin to nine inch nails in a good year all the way to a stage opera lacking only its phantom . fans of buffy will enjoy seeing Giles , the watcher sing his heart out once more as the Repo Man , Nathan . the little girl from the Spy Kids movie is growing up fast and is Nathan 's hot lil goth daughter . Musical buffs will quickly recognize and be hypnotized by sarah brightman . otis from devils rejects and ohgr from skinny puppy definitely looked like they had a good time together making this movie . even Paris Hilton , my one apprehension with this movie , surprised me with a genuine performance . when her father starts to distance himself from her and says she disgusts him , i really felt bad for her . and i was surprised that a movie made me feel that way for Paris Hilton . Saw fans can rest easy knowing this movie definitely deserves the Saw imprint as the gore does not disappoint . organs and blood galore ! Darren Lynn Bousman leaves Saw behind but brings his dark yet fresh style to this futuristic scifi\/horror musical . while the pacing threw me off a little , the images and overall atmosphere at times pleasantly reminded me of The Crow , and suddenly you remember you witnessing a cult phenomenon in the making . this movie has been out two days and is already getting flack . critics do n't know what their talking about . see this movie for yourself . bring a friend . buy the soundtrack and give it a try . also , if you memorized the soundtrack , be prepared to wait till the credits for `` needle through a bug '' . dunno what happened there . bottom line . great movie . great experience . its different from anything else you 've seen in a while .

" Repo The Genetic Opera . A FAN review . So what a movie ! First let me say that I knew what to expect throughout most of the movie . I heard the CD and knew it by heart . So the screening was completely sold out seat to seat was filled with a person . Unfortunately , no one sang at my screening of the film . No one dressed up , etc. . . and this could be a good thing . This means most of the people had no idea what repo was , just that it was probably a free movie . And at the end , everyone clapped . First off , repo is a rock opera set in the near future where organ repossession has become legal and repo men lurk in the streets in the night . Shilo , the daughter of one of these repo men , is told to have an infected disease . Her father , Nathan , pretends to be a doctor and care for her when at times she is n't around , Nathan turns into the repo man . Then there are the largos . Rotti Largo is the owner\/founder of genco and father of the three sibilings , Amber Sweet , Pavi Largo , and Luigi Largo . So let me start off by saying how much I like this film . It 's a great film with a great cast and a great story . I do have to admit , there were SOME flaws in the film . The plot of the two different families was very good and how they connected made it better . I liked how each of the character 's backstory was told in a comic like form with graphic images . The story I felt was sorta slowish in the beginning but seriously picked up some heat in the middle and did n't stop until the very end . It was amazing . The music was so great . Each actor had a different type of song for their character and each song was so great . Every song was like listening to nature . It was so natural and perfect that I can not think of any words to describe it other than awesome and amazing . There were maybe one or two I did n't like but it picked itself right back up with the next song . Anthony Head was perfect for the role of Nathan\/Repo Man . He has one of the best voices in the whole movie . His character is a worn down old dad who 's got only his daughter to live for . If he loses her , he loses everything . Head was the best choice for Nathan IMO . Sarah Brightman . Just that . It 's Sarah fricking Brightman . That name is perfect upon itself . I just wish she was given more songs to sing because she was underused IMO . Her best song is by far Chromaggia in the whole film . I love how everyone is silenced in the opera just listening to her perfect voice . Alexa Vega is def . an up and coming star . She was another great pick for the role of shilo Alexa brought the innocence in shilo straight into the screen and it came off onto the audience greatly . She has a great voice and hope to hear her again . Paul Sorvino . Oh my god what a voice . Seeing him sing was so amazing . His voice is perfect for opera and other musical related media . I 've never heard such a great voice in my whole life Never . He sings SO powerfully and strong it just grips you and never lets you go . The sibilings I felt were all great but were totally underused . They need more screen time . Now for the Graverobber . I did n't think I say this but his character felt so ... ... not pointless but a little unnecessary . All he does is get Shilo in trouble , explain Zydrate , and totally break the fourth wall -LRB- http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fourth_wall -RRB- . Him doing that made the film feel so much NOT like a film at all but something totally else . It just did n't fit and did n't feel right . I 'm sorry if that angers some people . The sets were beautifully made and crafted I could tell but after seeing them all felt a little small once you think of them . I know the film had a low budget but they used it all to good and made great sets that really took you into the film 's atmosphere . The effects were really really good for such a low budget film . Nice Job ! :D Overall , I found repo to be one hell of a good ride . There was guts , blood , nudity , genterns , singing , comedy , horror , glowing bugs , Giles , Sarah Brightman , and an Opera that NO one should miss and NEVER forget ! Overall I 'll give the film a 8\/10 One day I hope a sing along version is created for people and fans so that we can sing a long to the music because the music was so great . " ,10
" This should have been awesome ... . Have you ever been in a situation where you did n't laugh at someone 's joke and they decided you did n't ` get it , ' and you were too polite to say Oh , I got it , I just did n't think it was funny ? Well , for me , this movie is like that joke . The idea sound right up my alley . It 's got everything to fuel my geekish cravings . A dystopian , alternate future ? Check . Highly stylized , psychedelic imagery ? Check . A detailed world with a huge backstory ? Check . Hot , scantily clad chicks ? Tons of gore ? That guy from those old coffee commercials and Buffy the Vampire Slayer ? Check , check , and check . Taking all this together and then having the absurdity -LRB- and to clear things up , saying something of this nature is absurd is not necessarily a negative thing to me -RRB- of making it all a musical to boot ? My goodness , with all this I should have reached a state of nerdvana . When I heard about this movie I thought it would be the best thing since sliced bread . So , yes , I got it . Unfortunately I just did n't think it was funny . It 's all just so blah . While the story background is great and well-detailed , the plot itself is boring . The acting ranges from bad to abysmal , with a few exceptions of course . The music is very generic , with not a single thing standing out about it . The singing is all over the place , ranging from horrible to fantastic -- sometimes from the same actor -- but mostly plain bad . Let me put it this way : Paris Hilton is in it and she 's neither the worst actor nor the worst singer . Yeah you read that right . There were a few bright spots . Anthony Stewart Head was very entertaining -- when he was in his repo man persona at least . Additionally , I have to grudgingly admit I quite enjoyed Alexa Vega 's singing . Overall , I have to give it an A + for effort but an F for execution . Keep in mind , though , that this is the kind of movie that people either really love or really hate . I just happen to hate it . There 's a lot of people who really love the movie , so if you 're like me and think that the premise sounds great , maybe you should give it a try . " ,2
" no purpose . This movie had nothing , no plot , no good songs , no acting abiltys . I thought i was going to love this movie , boy was i wrong . First of all , for all of you that think this movie was artsy , it was cgi not hand drawn . Second for those of you who liked the music , you like crappy music , -LRB- i was expecting some opera , power metal , or anything coooll -RRB- instead it all sounded like my chemical romanace or some crappy , crap . Third all the people in the movie had no purpose , Why was this movie made , everyone in the movie was pointless.The charcthers were all dumb , i cant even explain how dumb they were , because i know nothing about them , there was no devolpment of them at all . The story line , or the concept was amazing , but the movie was not amazing at all . . . Another thing about the movie was there was hardly any gore at all , If you want to see a real musical see poultrygeist " ,3
" Omfg . My husband took me to go see this movie this weekend . I was sold as soon as he told me the base story . I am a horror fanatic , so the fact that this movie he mentioned was about a company who sales organs and body parts then sends someone to Repo them while you are awake when you are behind in your payments and it is by Twisted Pictures , I was totally in . So we went Saturday night . Omfg this movie was so good . The fact that the Repo Man ends up being Ghiles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and he could sing like that gave me chills . It is a rock opera but the singing is awesome . Everyone had the voices that matched their character . My husband I were both shocked to see Ms. Hilton in this movie but the part was so unflattering that she did really well -LRB- my eye is twitching saying that -RRB- and because this part might be her reality on day -LRB- how funny would that be -RRB- . Anyway if any of you can see it do it and pass this on . I know any horror fan will love it . It was so good and I am totally going to see it again . " ,10
" The Freshest movie out there . For many years there have been movies that have been released that have been the same set of stories over and over again . For the first time in my life , I have found a single movie that stands out as a Ground Breaking achievement in being a `` Fresh '' movie . Repo ! the Genetic Opera not only is just that , Ground breaking ; but it story is unlike ANYTHING that has ever been told before in the past . Both Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich with the assistance of Darren Bousman have brought us an instant classic that in years to come will show that it can withstand the test of time and become even more epic then it already is ! " ,10
" awesome movie experience . . This movie was amazing . rock opera 's equal awesomeness . i was a bit skeptical at seeing the film at first because of Paris Hilton but after meeting the director , grave robber and the music mixer guy up in Seattle they helped change my mind about her and she did an awesome job in the movie . The fact that Anthony Stewart head was in the movie is what sold it to me . being a huge Buffy the vampire slayer fan i had to go see it . i would definitely classify it in the cult classic category . i also loved having all the characters back story done in comic book style . at points the movie was a bit graphic and hokey but the sinister sense of humor made it what it is . Very original and a possibility of what the future could bring . It was also the most fun movie going experience i 've ever had . people singing along with , dressing up in costume , and getting to meet the people who made the film . I wish people would burst into song more often . this movie definitely inspires it . i think it should be released in theaters nationwide . i would pay to see it again . this movie does have an audience and should be given a fair shot . if it does n't make it to theaters i will so buy it when it comes out on DVD . " ,10
" The Most Original Movie In Years ! . It 's not a movie , it 's an event . Repo is most definitely an event , and it 's one not to be missed ! I saw the 3:45 showing at the Angelika this afternoon and it was quite packed ! Not the most enthusiastic audience , but I can tell there were definitely some hardcore Repo fans there . So the movie started and just like everyone else has said , the sound system is AWFUL . The surround sound was not on and the vocals sounded much louder than the actual music . It really detracted from the experience . But now onto the movie , during the first 10 minutes , I will admit I was a little nervous that the movie would n't be as great as I had hoped , but from that point on my expectations were shattered . `` Thankless Job '' was absolutely hilarious , using that dead guy as a puppet was brilliant ! I 'm not going to go into detail about every song , but MOSTLY every song was really catchy . The only song that I truly disliked was `` Limo Ride '' but that 's pretty much it . `` Chase The Morning '' looked even better on screen . Mag 's eyes were really awesome ! Overall , the last 30 minutes of the movie were my favorite . The Genetic Opera really gave me that Phantom Of The Paradise \/ Rocky Horror Show vibe ! This was the one part of the movie where I really wished the sound was better . Paris Hilton 's face falling off was hysterical and Sarah Brightman had me mesmerized in `` Chromaggia '' . It really made the impact of her gouging her eyes out even more emotional . The ending twist was great and quite unexpected . `` I Did n't Know I Loved You So Much '' was heartbreaking and sung beautifully . `` Genetic Emancipation '' really gave the movie that last emotional punch and Graverobber 's `` Epitaph '' was a great way to end the movie . Now onto the cast . Alexa Vega was excellent as Shilo Wallace . She has quite a set of pipes on her ! Spy Kid no more ! Anthony Head was amazing as Nathan\/Repo Man ! `` Legal Assassin '' was even better on screen . I could n't imagine anyone else in the role after seeing him . Sarah Brightman ... not much else left to say . She is a class act . She did n't have much screen time , but when she had it , she stole the show ! Bill Moseley and Ogre were hysterical as the Largo brothers and I think I like `` Mark It Up '' even more after seeing the movie . Pavi winning Amber 's face in the auction at the end of the movie was hilarious ! Terrance Zdunich was awesome as Graverobber . I really wish there was more of him in the movie because his songs were definitely some of the highlights of the movie . WHAT A VOICE . Now onto Paris Hilton ... ... Rolling Stone , SHUT UP ! She was perfect in the role of Amber Sweet and I wish she had more screen time . The only song of hers that was a little hard on the ears was `` Happiness Is A Warm Scalpel '' . Overall , is the movie perfect ? No . It is unbelievably unique ? YES . I ca n't see this hitting the mainstream , because in my opinion , it 's too good for the mainstream . This is the most original movie I have seen in years . Frankly , I ca n't remember the last original movie I 've seen ! Just like Darren said , Hollywood is filled with remakes and PG-13 horror movies , and we need more movies like REPO in the world of film ! It 's a true visual feast ! I strongly urge everyone to see this movie ! I only hope next time I see it , I see it with a MUCH better sound system . The music deserves to be heard in surround sound ! The movie was worth the wait ! Darren , Terrance and the rest of the cast , this movie is a work of art . " ,10
" One of the best movies of 2008 . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a futuristic thriller set in the year , 2056 , where organ failure has become an epidemic . The company , Geneco , began supplying new organs for those who need it , and allowed people to make payments on their organs as well . But , if you missed a payment , the Repoman tracks you down to reposes your organs . First , I want to point out the comic style artwork at the beginning and parts of the middle of the movie . The artwork was outstanding ! And did a very good job in helping to set the tone and introduction to the movie . The music was great and was very well done by everyone in the film -LRB- including Paris Hilton , though , I believe she was the weakest link in the cast , she still did a good job -RRB- . It seemed Paul Sorvino -LRB- who played the main villain , Rotti Largo -RRB- started off a bit on the weak part in the singing department at the beginning of the movie . . but he shined more and more throughout the movie , and sounded like an opera singing GOD by the end of the film . I was quite shocked and impressed that Paris Hilton -LRB- who played Amber Sweet -RRB- actually pulled off this role . She was n't `` outstanding , '' but she did get the job done , and did it well . Bill Moseley -LRB- who played Luigi Largo -RRB- and Nivek Ogre from the band , Skinny Puppy -LRB- who played Pavi Largo -RRB- supplied the comedy , as they often bickered back and forth and tried to 1-up the other one , and were very good at doing so ! Graverobber -LRB- played by writer and co-creator Terrence Zdunich -RRB- was also amazing ! Great voice and charisma ! Terrence helped navigate the story . But , there were 3 people in the movie that really made this goth\/rock opera movie shine ! That is Alexa Vega -LRB- who played Shilo Wallace -RRB- , Anthony Head -LRB- who played Nathan Wallace aka The Repo Man -RRB- , and Sarah Brightman -LRB- who played Blind Mag -RRB- . All 3 actors were awe-inspiring ! To know what I mean , you have to see the movie itself ! They did n't miss a beat , and played their parts as well as could be played . Anthony Head and Sarah Brightman are probably two of the best castings ever done for a movie . As for the movie , in all , it flowed pretty well . The only complaint I really have , is that they did n't explain much more about the Zydrate . They only had 2 or 3 small scenes that had anything to do with the Zydrate , which , to me , was a very interesting part of the story . Just wish I could have seen more about it , and more from Graverobber . As I said before , the movie flows really well , and most of it is explained thoroughly and is easy to follow -LRB- the story connection between Shilo , her father , and Rotti Largo was the actual main story -RRB- . . but the ending ... was a complete shock , and I even heard \* gasps \* in the audience at a certain part . The ending alone is worth the price of admission . In conclusion , I know this movie is n't for everyone . It is a very dark thriller movie `` musical '' -LRB- I hate using that word -RRB- . They sing throughout the movie , with very few actual speaking parts . . but the singing is actually what makes this a great and unique movie , and uniqueness is hard to find these days in the movie business . . especially uniqueness that is done well ! If you 're into dark humor , slashers\/horrors , and great acting , you 'll love this movie . . even if you 're not big into opera movies , I believe that you will still enjoy this movie . This is definitely in the Top 3 movies of 2008 , and in my Top 5 movies of all-time . " ,10
" Simply an ace film . After getting super hyped to see this movie , the day finally came and I thought to myself , `` What if REPO ! The Genetic Opera fails to meet all my high expectations ? '' But much like election day , that moment of fear for the worst was replaced by one of the best moments I 've experienced . New , original , excellent music . Dramatic , several moments of dark humor that can really pull an audience together in all their laughter . REPO ! is definitely an experience . I only heard about the film in early October , by then it had , while small , a very devoted and intense fan base . It was really only by chance that I chose to click a link and see what was being talked about , then read the plot summary . I was absolutely blown away . Then I checked out all the movie clips , and THEN the trailer . Managing to catch the listening party , five seconds later I bought the soundtrack and have been in love with it since . I was insanely lucky to be from one of the SEVEN cities that made it on the road tour , when only eight theaters -LRB- aside from road tour -RRB- in total were even screening the film . My excitement mingled with my friend 's is pretty extreme . Mingling it with 300 other people ? That just blows the mind . Darren Lynn Bousman - director , and Terrance Zdunich - co-writer as well as Graverobber in the movie , are responsible for getting up and traipsing around the country for the road tour have really taken lengths to prove that creators can still care about what they 've produced , and get to grasp just what a low-profile film 's audience is capable of , be it enthusiasm , or street team marketing . Big steps by a small group taken to get to a wider release ! " ,10
" Repo ! The Genetic Opera Stole My Heart . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a fantastic film that draws you in and makes you lose yourself . From the great cast to the amazing score , it is an experience that everyone can enjoy . From start to finish , it will have you absorbed into the world that is Repo ! If you have the chance to go see this movie , if it is playing anywhere within 100 miles of you , go there , watch it . You will not regret the trip . This movie is definitely well worth the price of a ticket , the time spent watching it , and still has awesomeness to spare . The cast delivers the score in such a way that the songs will be stuck in your head for days . Each of the actors brings their character to life in such a way that you would truly believe that is who they are in reality . At the end of it all , this is an amazing , original work of cinema art that will forever go down in history as the movie that brought back the opera ! Let it be heard that Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a film that is , and always will be , in the hearts of those that have seen it , felt it , and become a part of it . So please , if you have the ability to see this movie in its big screen glory , then I strongly recommend that you do so . " ,10
" It 's an understatement to say that this is the best opera , or even the best film this year . . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is that film that has to come along once in a while . It gives you something you 've never seen before and , love it or hate it , you can not deny that it is inexplicably new . It does n't rely on telling you the same stories over and over again and it certainly does n't rely on casting A-list celebrities and musical artists -LRB- as evidenced by Paris Hilton and Ogre -RRB- to get people to come watch it . No , Repo 's true genius comes in its ability to get out in the open , not play it safe . I 'm sure that when Bousman pitched the movie he probably would go on about organ repossessions and the amazing plot of the movie and the major corporate big-wigs would love the entire idea until he came to the opera part . It seems as though it 's the opera that keeps Lionsgate from releasing it everywhere , but it 's really the opera that makes this movie so amazing . The singing may not be the best you 've ever heard -LRB- Though Terrance Zdunich has a very sexy sounding voice -RRB- nor the music your own cup of tea -LRB- I actually am a fairly avid industrial fan , which is what drew me to the movie in the first place -RRB- but the music itself is so rightly placed with the mood of the movie that it makes it flow better than anything I 've ever seen . Now , perhaps I am biased because Zdunich just hugged me and said he loves me after reading my shirt about an hour ago -LRB- And I do n't think I actually paid for that poster even though I had my money out and ready ... sorry about that -RRB- , but the blaring contrast between the cast members make the story feel very ... believable . I 'm not going to go on about how one actor had a great voice or some actress did well on a specific song , that 's not what a movie is about . Repo ! is an experience , taken as a whole . With the most bizarre cast and style , this is sure to be a movie that inspires a new generation of films . Sadly , Rolling Stone gave it a .5 \/ 4 -LRB- But the reviewer only talked about Paris Hilton , who played one of the smaller supporting roles , and acted as if he had n't even seen the movie -RRB- , but this is exactly what I like to see . Something that 's so experimental and radically different as everything on the market as Repo ! , whether it 's trying to be or not , tends to stir up the big name reviewers . However , if it was n't for films like Repo ! that take that chance and took horrible reviews -LRB- I 'm looking at you , RHPS -RRB- , then surely we 'd all be stuck in a web of remakes and sequels . Long story short , Repo ! takes a daring leap , but hits the dismount perfectly . " ,10
" A great movie , worth a 3 hour drive to see . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is , well , a rock opera , and one of few at that . It ventures into territory that very few movies have gone before and succeeds greatly . The songs are well scored and almost always very natural . There are a few parts where talking may have been better than singing , but they 're overshadowed by the many amazingly well done songs in the movie . Alexa Vega , Anthony Stewart Head , Sarah Brightman , Paul Sorvino , Bill Moseley , Ogre , Terrance Zdunich and even Paris Hilton come together to make every song work beautifully . I will be purchasing the full soundtrack to be released in January . The visuals and acting are perfect . The movie looks amazing and that only compliments all the actors and actresses performances . Everyone was perfectly cast from Alexa Vega , playing Shilo Wallace , the sheltered daughter of Nathan Wallace , the Dr. \/ Repo Man -LRB- which he pulled off flawlessly -RRB- . Sarah Brightman looked and sounded amazing as Blind Mag while Paul Sorvino played a perfect Rotti Largo . Bill Moseley , Ogre and Paris Hilton were awesome as his 3 disappointing children . Terrance Zdunich was one of the best , fitting the Graverobber role perfectly as well as drawing the comic book-esk images for the film -LRB- not to mention being one of the minds behind Repo ! -RRB- When all was said and done , Repo ! The Genetic Opera definitely deserved it 's spot in my Top 3 Favorite films , and I 'll be one of the first in line to purchase the DVD early next year . " ,10
" The newest cult classic . This movie is not for everyone . But if you are someone who dresses up to go to Rocky Horror Picture Show , or you one of the rare few who actually liked Sweeney Todd -LRB- especially if you , like me , had to suppress a giggle at the idea of singing a sentimental heartfelt song while slashing someone 's throat -RRB- or if you watched The Crow a hundred times , and frequently bemoan the fact that goth has apparently died , then you will almost certainly like this movie . The music filled with raw emotion . Admittedly there are a few oddball scenes , but hey hardly detract from the overall experience . Anthony Stewart Head is brilliant as the Repo Man , and the Graverobber steals every scene he is in . This movie is a fantastic experience . I highly recommend that everyone who has a chance to see this movie takes advantage of their opportunity . It is sure to become the next cult classic . " ,10
" Repo ! - An exercise in `` gutsy '' film making . I saw Repo ! The Genetic Opera on November 12th , 2008 at a one night only screening at the Music Box Theater in Chicago . This is my first ever review on IMDb . So seeing Repo ! The Genetic Opera last night was n't on par with the theatrical experience of Grindhouse or There Will Be Blood , but it was close . Im appalled that the critics are saying its the worst movie ever made . While it was n't without its flaws -LRB- a few of the songs kinda sucked -RRB- , I can without hesitation say that it is one of the most ambitious and original concepts I have seen in a long time . If you can imagine Blade Runner meets Rocky Horror Picture show , with some really sick gore , even more fetishistic sexuality , and a hard rock\/industrial soundtrack , you have Repo . All of the character performances were top notch , particularly Anthony Stewart Head who steals the show in every scene hes in , and Alexa Vega who was very good herself . Much ado has been made about Paris Hilton but she gets all of like 10 minutes combined screened time in a 2 hour film - and even in that she was actually very , very good at playing a druggie corporate heiress who 's addicted to plastic surgery -LRB- a stretch ... I know -RRB- . I have a TON of respect for Darren Lyn Bousman after he screening and ensuing Q A last night . This guy is only 29 years old and had three Saw movies on his resume which he could have used to propel himself into a promising film career . Instead he burned all his bridges with Hollywood to make a film the way he wanted to without compromising any of his vision , and now hes totally being blackballed for it , but he could care less either way . He and the writer\/art director were both mad nice and I have a feeling I 'll be keeping an eye out and supporting anything they will be doing in the future both with Repo ! The Genetic Opera and other projects . All in all I think it was a great and ballsy bit of film making . While you can pretty much tell if you would like the movie by watching the trailer , I recommend it regardless . Be warned : aside from the copious gore -LRB- theres at least a half dozen scenes where the Repo Man collects organs on which payment is past due , including a nasty spinal extraction -RRB- , its all done in a way that is not only campy , but it embraces said campiness to the point of pitch black comedy . They 're talking about doing another road tour to hit up a dozen more cities after this tour was such a success and if they return to Chicago I would totally go again . I might even join some of the crazies and dress up as one of the characters just for the hell of it . Like Rocky Horror , its not a movie for everyone , but the crowd it appeals to is definitely a fun bunch . If you get a chance , check out the song `` Zydrate Anatomy '' either on the Repo website or YouTube . Its one of my more loved songs in the film and it stars not only a sexy Paris Hilton but the Graverobber , who in the movie plays the role of that observing Shakesperean style narrator . " ,9
" A truly unique film , not to be missed ! . After having first seen a small clip of Repo ! over a year ago , I have desperately wanted to see this movie . It would have been easy to come here and write a review about how amazing it is to get people interested , but in fairness to the review process , I have waited until officially seeing the film . Last night , I had the opportunity to finally see the movie I have been craving for over a year - - and it exceeded all of my expectations and more ! First to dispel any misconceptions , yes , it is by the same man who directed the majority of the Saw films . But , no , this movie is NOT Saw . It is not a horror movie . There is a ton of blood and violence -LRB- after all , it is about legal assassins who repossess human organs -RRB- , but it really is n't scary . There are a few tense moments , but those are brought about by the scenes in which the action makes you concerned for certain characters . The music is phenomenal ! I have been completely blown away by the soundtrack . And the film is a true opera -- all singing , all music -LRB- there are a few spoken words , but I would not consider it proper dialogue , and it is always underscored -RRB- . Co-writers Terrance Zdunich -LRB- Graverobber -RRB- and Darren Smith -LRB- Bandleader -RRB- succeeded in having over 50 songs that are all different styles of music -LRB- rock , punk , opera , classical -RRB- , yet they are extremely cohesive as a group , no song or style seems out of place . And the songs are catchy -- if you 're not humming Zydrate Anatomy for the next week , something is wrong ! My personal favorite `` Needle Through a Bug , '' a duet between the heroine Shilo and Graverobber , can be found on the soundtrack , but was deleted from the final version of the film . It will be included in the January DVD Blu-ray release . The performers\/cast are all in top form . Yes , even Paris Hilton . Many people will refuse to see this movie out of principle because they hate Paris Hilton . Please , do n't be one of those people . I have never been a big Paris fan and was n't very impressed with some of her other roles , including House of Wax . But Paris IS good in this , great even , the perfect person cast for the role of Amber Sweet . In a fantastic scene\/duet between her and Paul Sorvino -LRB- Rotti Largo -RRB- , her true singing and acting talents are shown , and I am now convinced of her abilities . I could go on and on about the others -- Tony Head -LRB- of Buffy fame -RRB- is amazing as the Repo Man\/Nathan who alternates singing voices depending on which identity he is , Sarah Brightman -LRB- I doubt she needs any review , her fame speaks for itself -RRB- as Blind Mag adds the ` traditonal ' style opera to the movie . Fans will be impressed and surprised by a grown up Alexa Vega who is the role of Shilo Wallace . The shining star of the film , in my eyes -LRB- yes , I am personally a big fan ! -RRB- , is truly co-writer Zdunich , who as Graverobber is equal parts creepy , sexy , and intriguing . Graverobber is present not only as a character involved in the world of the film , but also steps outside and acts as a sort of narrator . Zdunich also created all the graphic comic book - style art you see throughout the film . Not everyone who sees Repo ! will like it . You may be one of those people who hate it . But see it . In a world of movies that are all the same remakes , `` American Pie '' sex joke rip-offs , and cookie cutter romantic comedy nonsense , this film is truly something original , unique , and visionary . Darren Lynn Bousman has directed a wonderful film and truly brought this to life . The sets , the costumes , the way the film is shot are all impressive . I would never have guessed that this film had a ridiculously small budget . The world he has created is so rich and vivid it is easy to get lost and sucked into the year 2056 . There is so much to see , so many hidden gems that one viewing wo n't be enough to find everything . The film is , in a way , a tragedy , but Bousman has made many of the darker moments have elements of comedy . Withouth giving away any spoilers , one scene in particular to watch for is `` Thankless Job '' which had the audience members laughing and cheering while still managing to make them cringe ! On a personal note , having met both Darren Lynn Bousman and Terrance Zdunich at the Chicago screening , you would be hard pressed to find two nicer people . Both are amazingly humble and show huge amounts of gratitude for the fans , spending hours signing autographs , answering questions , and genuinely conversing with the people who are helping to make this film a success . Their passion and dedication for this film should not go unnoticed or unwritten as it shows how deeply they believe in Repo ! and the fans and that this is not just another film a director was forced to do . In the end , the decision is ultimately yours . You can believe what some critics are saying -- that this is THE WORST film ever made -LRB- that 's a bit hard to swallow -RRB- or that the music is completely atonal -LRB- not at all , check out the soundtrack on iTunes , or watch some of the clips on this page -RRB- . You can listen to the `` reviewers '' who wo n't say anything about the movie other than , `` Paris Hilton is bad . '' Or you can chose to believe the army of fans who have become deeply connected to this film , who show up hours in advance to just wait in line , who spend their time , energy , and money to help support a film that has received no backing from the studio . Either way , see this film now ! It is worth the trip and you will be able to make your own decisions ! " ,10
" REPO is a good movie and deserves to be seen !! . Let me preface things by stating that , flat-out , I am not a fan of horror movies . Not my thing . Add to that I 'm 37 yrs old and have stepped foot in a Hot Topic maybe once in my life and it 's pretty clear I 'm not the target audience for this flick . And with that said , I loved this movie . Is it perfect ? Of course not . It 's got plenty of issues and flaws , but so does every single movie out there anymore . But this is a good movie , a fun movie that 's heir apparent to ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW that deserves to be seen on the big screen by as many people as possible . Is it for everyone ? No . Will it disgust\/horrify\/turn off some people ? Absolutely . But does it deserve a wide release in a country that made BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA the number one movie two weeks in a row ? Damn straight . The plot 's been described before , so I 'll short-hand it here : in the future , the rate of organ failure is skyrocketing . A corporation called Geneco is formed to combat this epidemic , complete with easy financing for those unable to pay for the transplants at that time . However , if you fail to pay the corporation what it 's owed , they 'll send a shadowy Repo Man out after you to recollect the organ from you , with all the pain and gore and death it takes to make it happen . This film uses that backdrop to look at two families bound together by corruption and tragedy and sets it all to music . As far as the performances go , they 're all across the board but none of them really fall into the `` negative '' column . The highlights for me were Anthony Stewart Head as Nathan , the single father with a dark , sinister secret , and Terrance Zdunich as the Graverobber , who serves as our narrator for a portion of the movie . Sarah Brightman did a phenomenal job as Blind Mag , an opera singer with unique vision , but was under-used in the cut that was released -LRB- the directory , Darren Lynn Bousman , said in a post-viewing Q A that there were another 45 minutes or so that had to be cut due to budgetary concerns -RRB- . Alexa Vega did a good job and definitely shed whatever SPY KIDS remnants were left in my mind . The rest did well but these were the standouts . That brings us to the music . This is an opera , not a musical , so if somebody is saying something to someone in this film , odds are it 's going to be to music . The songs themselves are hit-and-miss , definitely , but for every one that fails or seems unnecessary\/tacked-on , there are one or two that work really well . Probably the best examples of this are `` At the Opera Tonight , '' the one used in the initial trailer that has the entire cast coming together in song -LRB- if not physical presence -RRB- and builds to the film 's climax ; `` Zydrate Anatomy , '' in which Zdunich explains to Vega the specifics of his job ; and `` Genetic Emancipation , '' Vega 's final song . Overall , though , I think these are songs that are going to be sung by amateur actors portraying the characters as midnight showing for years to come . And that brings us back to Lionsgate : there IS an audience for this film . They 're not your precious critics , trying desperately to seem artistic by casually dismissing this film and instead falling firmly on the side of pretentiousness . They 're the fringe element , the ones who do n't fit snugly into studio demographics and do n't rate inclusion in most test audience surveys . They 're the teens and twenty-somethings who could give a damn about the latest Kate Hudson romantic comedy or whatever new Rush Fast Mummy Furious Return Hour action drivel is being spewed out this week . Lionsgate could , for almost two hours , give a cinematic voice to these types and , thinking like a studio type , tap into their wallets for a healthy return . And then reap it all again when the DVD hits a few months later . And it might just attract a few people who do n't fit into that niche people like me . Instead , they 're looking to bury it to where they 're hoping nobody outside of LA , NYC , and a few other select cities will ever see it . I 'm sure they consider a DVD release little more than a contractual obligation at this point . And that 's just sad . Finally , I want to say how much I admire Bousman , Zdunich , and everyone involved for taking this on the road , trying to raise awareness of the film and prove to the studio that the audience will show if Lionsgate just provides the door . It would seem just so easy to let the system chew up this film and spit it out , then shove it under the rug . But Bousman and the rest have a real passion for this , something I could definitely see in them . Lionsgate do the right thing here . Give the guaranteed fans what they want . Do n't mess this up .

" Repo ! The most AMAZING experience of my life !!! . its almost too amazing to believe that I 've been a part of the limited group of people to see this `` Event '' . if there 's anything thats been done right about the marketing of this `` movie '' is that its not a movie ... it IS an event . as much s \*\* t the release of this movie has received , its at the same time almost a blessing . why ? because what i got to experience -LRB- chicago , music box theater , Darren and Terrance present -RRB- was the most amazing experience of my life ! its because of the utter lack of faith that lions gate has put in this movie that has allowed Darren to travel with the film . in a way its a lose\/win situation but at the same time a win\/win situation . if this movie received just a normal theatrical release , it just would NOT be the same . how the bout the film itself ? well i did give it perfect 10 . . because it is indeed perfect ! but really going over it.its not . its not the smoothest film . it poses questions and does n't even try to present an answer . but it does n't matter . you 're provided with such amazing writing and directing and ! MUSIC ! and cinematography and characters and situations and violence and girls and guys and and and everything!that you have to remind yourself that , again , its not a movie , its an event . none of the flaws , that a d \*\*\* he f \*\*\* a \*\* reviewer will rip to bits and let em be the only thing they see , distract a true viewer from appreciating this event . as Darren said at the QandA ... it is not for everyone but there definitely is an audience , which for whatever reason lions gate just cant see . not to compare this event to any other movies , but if Sweeney Todd -LRB- a movie with constant singing , blood and gore and cannibalism and murder -RRB- can have an audience and be successful , why not this ? also rocky horror picture show -LRB- a movie with transvestites , and constant singing , murder , homosexual undertones , cannibalism , aliens , -RRB- has a HUGE following and , true , it was n't successful at first , it grew into its success , but if there 's an audience for that ... why not this ? this has -LRB- constant singing , slashed necks , stabbing , gutting , spine removal , heart removal , eye gouging , impalement , grave robbing , surgery addicts , drug addicts , murder , brief boobs , shooting , hitting , `` other peoples face '' wearing , faces falling off , botched plastic surgery , sluts , ... . . -RRB- almost too much to be amazing ... just to clarify though ... the above movies are not RePO ! and never will be . RePO ! is beyond better , beyond amazing , beyond original ... its just too tragic that not that many will get to experience what i and so few others have . so many get to experience prom night and other like pieces of s \*\*\* which further illustrates how f \*\*\* ed so many people are . sure people can have their freedom and opinions , but than why does n't this get its freedom to be more than what its been given ?

" Rockey Horror Meets Phantom Of The Opera . This movie is the open door to a brand new , unbelievable world of original , fantastic entertainment . I went to see this movie on its Road Trip through the seven cities -LRB- I 'm so glad I live near a big enough city to get something like this ! -RRB- and I am won over as a die hard , vicious fan for all of all time . Let me put it this way ... This movie is for those people who are so sick of watching a revamp of the same story every time anything comes out . How many Friday the 13th 's are there ? How many Nightmares happened on Elm street ? It 's one of those things where you 're taken in , and you fall in love with it from start to finish because it 's seamlessly woven together in a myriad of fantastic threads . The music is diverse and NOT boring ! I mean , it 's not the run of the mill , same-old-same-old that we 're all so used to ! The acting is cutting edge and to a T ! The actors themselves are brilliant in every way , from Sarah Brightman 's common romantic-Gothic beauty and brilliance -LRB- a true star in every way -RRB- , to Paris Hilton hitting the mark in every scene she played . We have Alexa Vega who just dominated the screen and stole your heart to the split-personality Anthony Head ! The best movie to come out in at LEAST two decades and I 'll tell you something else ... The next time I hear someone say that there is n't a fan base for this , I 'll tell them how the theater was jam packed -LRB- and people had to be turned away -RRB- , and we were singing along , and there were people in costume ! The next time I hear , `` Worst Movie Of All Time '' , I 'll tell them that it 's not a bad movie ... it 's just brand new and they do n't like it , cause they do n't get it . All in all , I 'd go see this movie every night it showed . I should think you should too . " ,10
" Revolution is NOW ! . The imagery in this film is one of the reason to see it . The propaganda definitely gives you a sense of cold throughout the scenery . It melds so well with the music and content of the story . The characters are so unique with all they down to the way they sing . If you are a fan of film this is definitely a spectacle not be missed . Never has there been a film which such operatic integrity and completely nail on the mark . This film is an instant cult-classic and will forever be known as the opera that has inspired so much in me . On top of the movie being excellent , the filmmakers have gone through so much during the production and release of this film that they have earned a viewing from an audience that is not interested , too ! BUY the soundtrack ! SEE the film ! BE PART OF THE SHOW ! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE ! " ,10
" Dark , Campy , Brilliance . I just saw this movie at the Chicago showing , and I am glad I did . I first heard about this movie from a friend who when he told me it had Ogre from Skinny Puppy , Paris Hilton , and Sarah Brightman in it , I new I had to see it -LRB- just because I new it was going to be at least interesting -RRB- . I did n't have the highest expectations going in , I was expecting a Rocky Horror type experience -LRB- not exactly Oscar-worthy but entertaining in its ridiculousness -RRB- and the film definitely had those moments -LRB- for instance , Anthony Stewart Head using a freshly gutted corpse as a ventriloquist 's dummy , stuff like that -RRB- . But there was also genuine emotion in this movie , something that is seldom seen in modern films . Alexa Vega 's performance as a 17-year old involuntary shut-in was heart-wrenching , as was Head 's performance as a Organ Repo man\/slash father to aforementioned shut-in . And as for the big question on everyone 's minds , Paris Hilton does n't suck nearly as much as I thought she would . Plus , she 's in the movie for roughly ten minutes and it 's spread out , so it 's not like she has a huge part , so there is no need to ignore the film due to her involvement . All in all , I have no idea why this movie is being treated as if it has leprosy , but I ca n't wait until the DVD " ,9
" Saw it Last Night ... . So , first off , I listened to the soundtrack for a couple of weeks before I went to see the movie . A friend had told me about it and the stage production , so I figured I 'd look into it . The soundtrack was fascinating . I ended up adding it to my regular play list and , by the time the movie got to Chicago , I knew most of the songs . While some reviewers might claim to hate the music ... seriously ? I have to ask if their idea of good music is elevator jingles . The quality of the instrumentation was excellent and ... well , you should listen just to hear Paul Sorvino and Sarah Brightman , if nothing else . If you like Kamelot , Nightwish , Evanescence , Rasputina , or Abney Park ... this music will make you very , very happy . It helps to listen to the soundtrack before you go see the movie . Secondly , the directors have respected their audience . This movie had a story that was complicated , yes , but they did not dumb it down for the typical viewer . It is not silly or vague . The imagery is shocking at times , and the plot is taken straight from an Italian opera . It was a great deal of fun , visually . The gore was tolerable to me , and I am not , generally , a horror fan . I keep trying to find something comparable to this , visually , and it 's hard to do . I 've never seen anything quite like it . The movies I have come up with are in the science fiction genre and various horror movies , vampire flicks , and music videos . But none of those quite compare to actually sitting down and seeing this movie in action . Thirdly , none of the actors in this film did poorly . Say what you will , I would highly recommend going to see Repo ! without making any assumptions beforehand about who is in it . I ca n't say enough how much I enjoyed Shilo 's -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- interaction with her father -LRB- Anthony Stewart Head -RRB- . And his ability to shift seamlessly from the caring father to the hideous nature of the Repo Man carried the film . If nothing , else , that is worth a look . Blind Mag , played by Sarah Brightman , does something at the end of her roll that ... well , I 'm not going to spoil it . It sent chills through me . All said , I had no complaints . This movie was completed on a shoe string budget , but the ingenuity of it 's director , writers , and actors is apparent in every moment of the film . While Repo ! wo n't appeal to everyone , it should n't have to . I think , even if it just opened at Universities and Art House theaters throughout the U.S. and Canada , it would surprise the distributors with how well it would be received by audiences . The audience in Chicago LOVED it . Maybe they were n't entirely the main stream sort of audience that most movies want to draw , but there happen to be a lot of people in the world who will like it and will want to see more of it . Hell , if it comes to town again , I 'm buying tickets for myself and friends . It was good fun for the rocker girl brainy types :D " ,10
" Everyone Should Go to the Opera Tonight . You generally go into movies like this one with the feeling that it will be genuinely , horribly awful or so horribly awful that it 's good . Rarely ever do you expect it to actually be a good movie . Given the awful critical reviews of the movie in conjunction with the rabid approval and overwhelmingly positive moviegoer reviews I was expecting a Rocky Horror-so-bad-it 's - good movie . Repo way exceeded my expectations . Right from the opening sequence of comic book frames setting the scene to the climatic blood-bathed opera sequence , it captivated my attention and blew me away . It is an opera so every word is sung , or at least spoken in rhythm . The style is futuristic with soft-edged dark colors that match the mood perfectly . And the performances are all top-notch fantastic . Alexa Vega carries the movie as the main character , Shilo Wallace , proving that she can sing and act quite well . I loved Sarah Brightman as Blind Mag , it was awesome seeing as acclaimed an opera singer as her having a blast in this movie . Contrary to what some may think , Paris Hilton was great , I even found myself wanting to see more of her character . While not understated , she 's not a scenery-chewing showboat either , she knows the scope of her part and plays it within those confines very well . The music is fantastic and while the movie is bloody , I -LRB- who has a weak stomach -RRB- found the violence just sparse enough to not make it hard to watch . This is a fantastic , visionary film that deserves more recognition\/publicity\/of a release than it 's getting right now , please go see it . " ,9
" Absolutely Amazing . I was one of the very lucky people in Seattle to get see this movie and meet the director . My friend turned me on to this movie about a year ago and I 've been waiting since then for it to come out . But I was very surprised when I realized they were n't releasing it . I learned later it was because the critics thought it was crappy . Well I am here to say that this movie is fantastic . I 've been waiting for something new and exciting to hit the screens . In an age of sequels and re makes its hard to find something original . For one let me say the music was amazing . Everything had a way of flowing together and it was very interesting to see a movie where 95 % of it was just music . The visuals were great even on such a low budget . Although , and I 'm not sure if it was the theater I was in or if thats how the movie was edited , but there was a faint glow on everything white and it kind of annoyed me -LRB- hence the 9 out of 10 score -RRB- Everything else was just great , Paris Hilton -LRB- despite the bad publicity -RRB- did exceptionally well and deserves more credit . Sarah Brightman was just spectacular ! Now lets not forget Anthony Head here either . He was just as amazing if not more then then the others . Along the lines of Rocky Horror , if you enjoy music and violence , you will adore this movie ... and if your not , well this movie will still be appreciated by those with more conventional tastes . " ,9
" Wonderful . A truly rare gem from the movie world , Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a movie I feel everyone should experience . Even if it does n't seem like it is `` up your alley '' it is definitely worth seeing . I came across the video for the song `` Zydrate Anatomy '' and was immersed in the nursery rhyme style of the song and the catchy words . I immediately looked for more and came across `` Chase the Morning '' and `` Seventeen '' which were equally as catchy . Then I read reviews and summaries . Even the negative reviews did nothing more than fuel my curiosity . `` An instant cult-classic '' was a phrase I read many times in my research . I have been to showings of cult movies -LRB- i.e. Rocky Horror -RRB- but they did nothing to prepare me for what I saw when I pulled up to the theater for Repo ! People who had not even seen the movie yet -LRB- as it was both the opening and the closing night in the one theater in this whole state -RRB- , were in full costume -LRB- which meant half dressed -RRB- out in the cold wet weather that is Seattle , Washington . Once my friend and I took our seats in the decrepit theater we were enveloped in song . The fans had begun singing -LRB- rather well -RRB- songs from the movie and this continued until the movie started ! The movie itself left little to be desired . It had an amazing story , the songs were wonderfully written and performed , and the music itself was breathtaking . The only thing that could have made the movie better is if they had better funding . Lionsgate gave them a grand total of 8 million -LRB- ridiculously low in the movie world -RRB- dollars to create this because they did n't believe it would have enough of a fan base to bring the money back in . But even though the funding was insanely low it is n't too obvious on the screen . The sets are beautiful , the costumes are beautiful and the world fully enveloping . After the movie the director , Darren Lynn Bousman -LRB- Saw sequels -RRB- , the co-writer\/illustrator\/prop master\/actor , Terrance Zdunich , and the music producer , Joseph Bishara , went on stage and answered questions , signed autographs and gave hugs\/handshakes . They were down to earth and entertaining . They also said that due to lack of funding they had to cut a lot of scenes from the finished product which made me sad . I think Terrance Zdunich 's character , Graverobber , needed a larger part -LRB- mainly because it was obvious he was supposed to -RRB- . Point is we need to rally behind this amazing movie . It is amazing and it needs , it DESERVES , a wider release . Lionsgate was VERY wrong in saying there is no fan base for this movie . It is OUR job to prove them this movie deserves more ! GO SEE IT ! " ,9
" A new Hollywood standard , . Repo ! is quite simply a masterpiece . Darren Bousman , Darren Smith , and Terrance Zdunich poured their hearts , souls and careers into making this film and produced something unlike anything we 've ever seen before . A truly unique vision that will leave anyone who sees it screaming for more . The film really is a rock opera , meaning there is no dialog in the film , all of the performers sing from beginning to end with very little pause . A truly spectacular performance from all those involved . But the biggest surprises came from Paul Sorvino and Paris Hilton . I 've been a fan of Paul Sorvino for a long time , but I had no idea of the range and control he has over his voice , I was amazed . Paris Hilton , I can only say wow . From the beginning let me say that I have never been a Paris Hilton fan . Her death scene in House of Wax was the only thing that made that movie watchable . But here and now I take back a lot of what I said about her . Not only does she deliver an out standing performance , but for the majority of the picture you nearly forget that it is Paris Hilton . She makes you believe in the character , and from what the director said , is one of the more professional actresses he 's worked with . And yes , she can sing . Repo ! The Genetic Opera delivers a beautiful and stunning example of the type of directorial devotion that Hollywood has lacked in the last few decades . An example of artists and performers standing by there art and fighting for what is nothing less that an instant classic . Critics are saying there is no audience for this type of film , and that if Darren Bousman , Darren Smith , and Terrance Zdunich are lucky , in ten years it might develop a kind of Rocky Horror cult following . But the bottom line is this , the film sold out in no time , people who had never seen the film arrived in costume singing pieces of the Opera in the rain hours before the show started . This is Rocky Horror on enough acid to kill a small village , and it has a cult NOW ! If it 's coming to your city soon , go . Do n't think about it , just go . If it 's not coming to your city , drive to were it is playing and experience it . And scream at your local theaters , demand Repo ! This truly is one of the greatest films I have ever seen . " ,10
" I really wanted to like this , but ... . . . God awful . Just terrible . I followed the hype with giddy anticipation from the first whisperings about it on horror fan-sites , the concept sounded brilliant , the casting was irresistible , I was sure this was going to be real entertainment . Even if it was bad , it had to be good . I could n't have been more mistaken . There are glimmers of what this film could have been , but they are few and serve only to remind you of how much this good idea failed to live up to its potential . Remember the poems you used to write in third grade . `` I love to see the blue blue jay , I love to see it fly all day . '' This is about what you can expect from the lyrics throughout . The actors ca n't really be faulted , they did the best they could with what they were given . About halfway through I just started cringing every time a new song would start because I was embarrassed for these actors trying to breathe life into possibly the worst dialogue I 've ever heard . Just sad , I really wanted to like this . But do n't believe the raves , it really is just bad . " ,2
" Absolute Crap . The worst songwriting I think I have ever come across . Absolutely terrible . I gave it two stars because it was funny bad in a couple of places and I laughed once or twice . Some of the costuming is cool but sitting through the whole movie is torturous . The singing is all bad too . Imagine a 14-year-old who knows a few power chords on guitar that decides to write a musical and somehow gets funding to make a feature length production and produces an opera at that . How did they get Sarah Brightman to be in this production ? I 'm thinking they sold her on the costuming she was going to wear and did n't let her hear the music until she signed the contract . I 'm not going to be eloquent here . This movie sucks . I saw it for free and I still feel ripped off . " ,2
" Warning ! Cheesy rock opera inside . For the DVD release of this -LRB- the Scandinavian one at least -RRB- they made absolutely sure that no mention of it being a musical appeared anywhere on the cover , knowing full well that musicals just are n't good sellers here . So there you are with your new Thriller\/Horror movie and right away they start to sing . WTF ? Your money is gone . It is unwatchable and can only be classified as a scam . No , I 'm not fanatically opposed to musicals any more than I am fanatically against porn . There just is n't very much of it that is any good , that 's all . For instance I liked Singing in The Rain even though I was born a long long time after its era and also happen to be straight . Not only was it very professionally made and scored but you could tell what it was before you paid to see it . But this is pure exploitation . A fake front meant to lure you in . Exactly why people will never stop illegally downloading movies , because as long as they are lied to by marketing departments , the only way of knowing for sure is to see for yourself first . " ,1
" Repo was a disappointment and I think Kurt Loder best described it in the following review . Anyone intent on reviving the rock opera , that most misbegotten of pop-music genres , should consider two things . The first would be , do n't do it . The second , if one were determined to do it anyway , would be the need for songs brief musical compositions of sufficient sturdiness to ensure that they wo n't be forgotten while they 're still being sung . With `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera , '' director Darren Lynn Bousman has ignored the first of these precepts ; and his songwriting collaborators , Terrance Zdunich and Darren Smith , have n't been especially successful in observing the second . The result is a work that stirs retrospective appreciation of the mock-bombastic Meat Loaf . Meat Loaf , you 'll recall , had songs . The movie has metastasized from a 2002 stage play written by Zdunich and Smith and directed by Bousman . It 's set in a post-apocalyptic world in which millions have died in an epidemic of organ failures , and a biotech company called Geneco has arisen to sell transplantable organs to needy survivors and to repossess the pricey innards whenever the owners fall behind in their payments . The scalpel-wielding characters who carry out these grisly interventions are called repo men . One of them is secretly a doctor named Nathan Wallace -LRB- Anthony Head , of the `` Buffy the Vampire Slayer '' TV series -RRB- , who 's been forced into this vile sideline by Geneco founder Rotti Largo -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- . Largo is terminally ill , and determined not to let his lucrative organ business pass into the hands of his good-for-nothing children -LRB- one of them played by Skinny Puppy frontman Ogre ; another , with unwarranted enthusiasm , by Paris Hilton -RRB- . Instead , he wants to bequeath his empire to Wallace 's daughter , Shiloh -LRB- Alexa Vega , of the `` Spy Kids '' films -RRB- , because her late mother was , as he sings in a characteristically tuneless interlude , `` once very dear to me . '' The plot thickens like a week-old blood pudding . The movie 's art direction -LRB- by Anthony A. Ianni -RRB- and production design -LRB- by David Hackl like Ianni and Bousman , a veteran of the `` Saw '' movies -RRB- are deliriously flamboyant . The city in which the story is set is dank and tainted , shrouded in endless night . The lighting leans heavily toward a super-saturated blue , the characters skulk about through a fog of halation , and the visual quality in general is pure Polaroid . Wardrobe designs are goth , of course lots of black-leather S M gear , with mascara and lipstick all around and the city itself is a lurid digital chowder of grim streets and dark graveyards spread out in the shadow of the towering Geneco headquarters . All of this might have been fun , sort of , were it not for the grinding metal guitar-riffery upon which this being a rock opera the characters ' every word must be conveyed . Thirty years after `` The Rocky Horror Picture Show , '' there 's nothing shocking about the third-hand decadence on display here . What really startles are some of the unexpected performers lunging around in the murk . What could Sorvino have been thinking as he blustered through the din , trailed by a long gray ponytail , belting out lyrics like `` Maggots , vermin you want the world for nothing ! '' And how did actual singer Sarah Brightman Andrew Lloyd Webber 's onetime wife and muse feel about being tricked out as some sort of pop-eyed Elvira puppet ? The songs are n't uniformly dreadful one of them , `` Seventeen , '' is a lively arena-punk anthem that Vega delivers with near Avril Lavigne-level energy but the tunes are largely formless , and many of the lyrics have the flat quality of words that should have been simply spoken , not sung . -LRB- `` Did n't I tell you not to go out ? '' Wallace bellows at his sheltered daughter , in response to which she warbles , `` You did ! You did ! '' -RRB- The picture runs just 98 minutes , but it already feels too long three-quarters of the way in . It feels unnecessary from the beginning . " ,1
" Worthless movie . I can see how this movie tries to take everything that is popular in this genre and mix it together . You throw a little Tim Burton , Ichi The Killer and Hostel in a blender and you get Repo ! The Genetic Opera . The movie starts out interestingly enough but it quickly loses it 's focus as the first song starts playing . Let me tell you how much the music sucks in this movie : Evanescence . It really is one of the worst soundtracks I 've ever heard . The music was actually one of the main reasons why I had to shut off my DVD player after 50 minutes . I must add that I have never ever stopped watching a movie because of it 's badness before . The story is so much over the top that it 's not even funny . They were n't making this movie for the story but why did it still have to be so cheesy ? I got only one thing to say about the acting . Next time : get some actual actors ! Repo ! The Genetic Opera really is one of the worst movies I have ever watched . I really like this kind of bizarre\/violence-horror genre and the elements it was working on . Repo ! failed to deliver me any kind of enjoyment . " ,2
" If you like this movie you 'll hate me for this review . . Music is one of my passions . I love music , and sometimes I enjoy the occasional musical . So one day I 'm at a party with a group of friends , and things wind down until there are like ten of us left . So someone brings up the fact that I have never seen this movie . One thing leads to another , and we watch this movie . This is where I must also say that I 'm a pretty big movie buff . I love cinema . However , whilst I love music , and cinema I do have standards . This movie simply did not meet those standards . People say that this is the next big cult classic . I would have to disagree . If you want a cult classic watch Rocky Horror Picture Show . If you want a good musical look up Sweeny Todd , My Fair Lady , or The Sound of Music . This movie is n't so great . The acting is poor at best . One of the lead characters is the girl from freaking Spy Kids . Do I really have to say more ? The music is n't very appealing , and I 'm open minded with my music . I listen to everything , but I have standards . The music in this film really missed the mark in my opinion . The lyrics were just plain out terrible . There were only five or so songs that I halfway enjoyed throughout the entire film . Which for a musical is a really big problem . Then you have the plot , I 'm not even going to open that can of worms . Yet now I have to be fair . This movie has a few redeeming qualities . I liked the artistic design . The backgrounds were haunting , and quite depressing . The comic strips they used to move the plot forward were also done nicely . The fact that everyone was goth kinda threw me off , but hey what can you do . So since this movie had a few redeeming qualities I 'll give a four , as generous as that rating may be . " ,4
" More repossession less singing . I understand that it is supposed to be an opera , but the title is so misleading . I was not a fan of the plot at all . The singers are not bad besides Paris Hilton . She ca n't sing or act at all and deserves her razzie award for this film and for all films . Keep her out of productions please . Title of the movie should not be repo , it should be called geneco organ donors . That is a more accurate description of this movie or musical whatever you would like to call it . Very upset with the producers because it has nothing on Saw . If you are a musical type of person with a little sadistic side than this may be the film for you . Otherwise I 'd pass . " ,4
" An Epic Goth Musical !!! . I 'm usually not a big fan of musicals , but I decided to give this a chance . I bought this with Max Payne and Saw V a few hours before Obama 's Inaugurated . I thought Repo was really good ! I love how it had the goth look and feel of the movie ! I also loved the style , visuals , and beautiful scenery it had ! Darren Lynn Bousman did an awesome job ! In the future , an epidemic of organ failures plagues the city , but GeneCo gives organ transplants , but if the person never pays up , GeneCo sends out the Repo Man . Repo Man happens to be the father to Shiloh , played by the beautiful Alexa Vega . The owner of GeneCo , Rotti Largo is dying and wants to give GeneCo to Shiloh . Rotti 's children , Luigi , Pavi , and Amber Sweet want to inherit GeneCo , but Rotti hates them . I loved the rock music ! I highly recommend REPO ! THE GENETIC OPERA !!! " ,10
" It 's not just a movie , its an EVENT . REPO ! THE GENETIC OPERA On November 21st , movie theaters everywhere were seated to maximum capacity with hardcore super fans , writhing in their costumes with anticipation . Unfortunately , the majority of these fans were going crazy for the entirely wrong movie - Twilight . Unbeknownst to many , there was another movie that premiered in Toronto that very day , a movie that is easily cinematic gold next to the mindless and dreary vampire-romance rubbish : Repo ! The Genetic Opera . Based on a stage play originally ten minutes long , Repo is set in the year 2056 , a time when an epidemic of organ failures devastates the planet . Out of the tragedy , a savior emerges ; GeneCo , a bio-tech company that offers organ transplants , for a price . Surgery becomes a fashion statement . The trouble is , if you miss your payments , GeneCo sends out the Repo Man , who can legally bring back GeneCo 's property by any means necessary . The story revolves around Shilo Wallace , a girl with a blood disease , searching for a cure . Her father Nathan keeps her locked in her room , because the same disease killed her mother . Nathan also happens to be the Repo Man , unknown by Shilo . Their story intertwines with that of Rotti Largo , the head of GeneCo , who is dying of a terminal , incurable illness , and his three children , Luigi , Pavi , and Amber , who fight over who will inherit GeneCo once Rotti dies . It also happens to be a rock opera , inter-cut with comic book segments , in lieu of programs given out at conventional operas . If many of you are scratching your heads in puzzlement because you have never even heard of this movie , I do n't blame you . Repo has had no promotion done by its studio , Lionsgate . There have been no trailers released in theaters , not even any backing to get it into theaters . Repo was originally going to be a straight to DVD release , because no one believed in the movie . No one , except for the film 's director , Darren Lynn Bousman -LRB- of Saw 2 , 3 , 4 fame -RRB- and Terrance Zduinch and Darren Smith , the stage play 's creators , who portray Graverobber and Bandleader , respectively . After an incredible amount of promotion done on their own time , with their own money , DLBerranSmith -LRB- as the fans fondly refer to the trio as -RRB- were able to get Repo into a couple of film festivals , and into two theaters , in New York Los Angeles . With the help of the dedicated , die-hard fans , Repo embarked on a road tour , and was able to get shows in Dallas , Las Vegas , Chicago , Seattle , Orlando , and more , with DLB and Terrance attending each showing . But most importantly , Repo came to Toronto , at Bloor Cinema downtown . DLB came for the Toronto opening , and did a Q A session for the fans for about an hour . Afterwards , he took pictures with the losers -LRB- me -RRB- , and talked to the stragglers -LRB- me -RRB- . Darren was such a genuinely nice guy , and really passionate about Repo , a movie he had been fighting to get out for eight years . He told us that the studio told them over and over again that no one would like this movie , that it was a niche market , that this movie would fail miserably ... I was utterly flabbergasted . This movie has a such a wide range of potential fans . Take Alexa Vega -LRB- of Spy Kids -RRB- , Anthony Stewart Head -LRB- Buffy the Vampire Slayer -RRB- , Paul Sorvino -LRB- Capulet from Romeo + Juliet of grade ten English -RRB- , Sarah Brightman -LRB- professional opera singer -RRB- , Bill Moseley -LRB- Devil 's Rejects , House of 1000 Corpses -RRB- , Ogre -LRB- front man of industrial band Skinny Puppy -RRB- , and Paris Hilton -LRB- no explanation required -RRB- , and put them all in one movie ? You 've got an enormous fan base . Even Paris Haters could get in on this movie , considering her face falls off at one point , due to ample plastic surgery . That 's not even looking at the genres - musical , horror , and a hint of comedy . And the music - from the pure opera of Chromaggia , sung by Sarah Brightman , to the poppy-techno beats of Blame Not My Cheeks -LRB- Dont Touch the Butt -RRB- , sung by Paris Hilton , to the punk rock Seventeen , sung by Alexa Vega . Any music lover could watch this movie and find at least one song they fell in love with . Where else could you find a song that uses the cello and kazoo as its main instruments that actually sounds GOOD , as in Mark it Up , sung by Moseley and Ogre with a campy , over the top Italian accent ? DLB is constantly quoted as saying `` It 's more than a movie , it 's an event . '' Completely true . While fans of Twilight were probably giggling and squealing about how `` hawt '' Eddie C is whilst in line , us Repo fans were all dressed up and singing Zydrate Anatomy . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is an inspiration to all . From its fight to get the wide release it so justly deserves , to the stunning visuals , to the contemporary music , to its revolutionary concept , Repo is a beacon of hope to movie goers lost in a sea of Disney 's latest PG-13 family friendly romps or romantic comedies starring aging has-beens . It 's so important to broaden your movie horizons and try watching something new or completely different , or else the movie industry will never move forwards , and we will be stuck with remakes and sequels forever . Repo is a must see . You just might learn something about yourself . Or maybe you just enjoy knife wielding maniacs , rapists who take woman 's faces and wear them as masks , or more simply , Paris Hilton in barely there corsets . Either way , it 's a cult classic in the making and will only gain momentum as time goes by . Get ready for Repo , coming to a midnight screening near you . " ,10
" This movie was an awesome experience . Well , the summary kinda says it . I got a chance to see this at a showing in Pittsburgh Pa. . I 'm not someone who normally likes opera or musicals . Hell , I think Sweeney Todd and Rocky Horror are the only musicals I 've ever seen and really liked , and Phantom of the Opera was about the only opera . Nut Repo is definitely going on my list of favorite movies . The story was like a mix of goth and cyberpunk to me ; and being a fan of both groups , I loved it . You have a guy running around repossessing organs , and people way too obsessed with cosmetic surgery . Like cyberpunk , it shows a possible future ; one that may come true if we are n't careful . The shear amount of musical talent present in the movie was astonishing . From what I can remember , this is Sarah Brightman 's only movie appearance . Her voice was phenomenal as always . Alexa Vega , Paul Sorvino , Anthony Head , Paris Hilton , and Terrance Zdunich give outstanding vocal performances . All in all , great music , great acting , a fun story ; it all made for an excellent movie . I would definitely recommend this movie . " ,10
" Near Gene-iusCo . For the past few days , I 've been trying in vain to rationalize an argument opposing all the `` Rocky Horror '' comparisons that have befallen `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' in the wake of its all-too-limited release , but have come up with only weak hypotheses . So , there you have it : `` Repo ! '' is kind of like `` Rocky , '' at least insofar as the potential for a Cultural Phenomenon -LRB- that runs the risk of overshadowing the film itself -RRB- is concerned ; I could easily see this tale of a bleak future where organs are repossessed like cars becoming a celebrated , participation-heavy midnight tradition -LRB- and the handful of theaters playing `` Repo ! '' have clearly been trying to capitalize on this with later showings -RRB- . The difference between the two ? Well , `` Repo ! '' is actually worth your time . Drowned in prerelease hype largely inspired by distributor Lionsgate 's endless shuffling of an official release date , `` Repo ! '' amassed a cult following before it even played a single theater . Now that it 's here , I can easily say it 's one of the most visually and conceptually unique films to come out of the compost-heap year of 2008 , and also the most rousing movie musical since `` Sweeney Todd . '' -LRB- Yeah , my tastes lean strongly toward the macabre , so I 'm a tad biased . -RRB- That being said , `` Repo ! '' is not without flaws . As directed by `` Saw '' sequels alumnus Darren Lynn Bousman , the film 's overall look veers a bit too closely to the familiar bowels-of-hell grit and grime of some labyrinth torture chamber -LRB- which is appropriate given `` Repo ! '' 's subject , but the visuals simply could have been a bit sharper and dynamic -RRB- . Another issue is the characterization : while all of the main players in this complex , richly interwoven narrative are given a chance to convey their personalities and vices through song , some of the parts feel truncated -LRB- maybe this is just my way of saying I wanted to see\/hear more -RRB- . And the comic-book panels that frequently intercut the action with important plot points , while complementing the bleak futurist world , are also presented \* without \* sound , a curious choice that makes me wonder if the budget ran out during post-production . But these issues are all ultimately minor quibbles -LRB- I just wanted to get them out of the way before digging into the meat -RRB- . `` Repo ! '' is a sometimes-humorous , sometimes-satirical musical that swells to a pitch of dramatic tragedy so potent and heartfelt that even Bill Shakespeare would have shed a tear for its characters . Nathan -LRB- Anthony Stewart Head -RRB- is father to the terminally ill Shiloh -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- ; but he 's also a Repo Man for GeneCo , the organ-replacement empire founded by the ailing Rotti Largo -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- ; in the meantime , Rotti 's children -- the sociopathic Luigi -LRB- genre staple Bill Moseley -RRB- , vain Pavi -LRB- Skinny Puppy 's Ogre -RRB- , and surgery-addicted Amber Sweet -LRB- Paris Hilton -RRB- -- are taking matters of inheritance into their own hands . As with `` Sweeney Todd , '' getting used to a cast not known for their singing takes some adjustment , but once `` Repo ! '' takes off , it becomes a deliciously unorthodox model musical , with the sung dialog filling in bits of nuance , foreshadowing , and psychology that would have come across as bland in a conventional narrative film . Even if that pesky `` Rocky Horror '' comparison dogs it for the rest of its days , `` Repo ! '' 's reputation will be built , first and foremost , on its skilled film-making . With inspired horror films becoming increasingly sparse as the new Millennium wears on , `` Repo ! '' breathes fresh life and renewed potential into the genre . 7.5 out of 10 " ,8
" Review . I went to the Bloor Cinema with two friends , and went to see this movie . I heard about this movie in the beginning of the year , and I was excited ever since . I told my friend about this and showed her the trailer , and she loved it as well . I loved the music , the acting , and just everything about it ! I love how Nathan 's voice changes when he 's Repo ! Man . Alexa was awesome , and so was Paris . I did n't realize that they both had good voices until I saw this movie . I like them a whole lot better now . I suggest you find a theater near you and go watch this movie ! It is sooo worth it .

" Amazing ! . Seeing this movie , or rather , going to the event was so amazing and fun . I had listened to a couple of the songs before seeing the movie , but I did n't realize how unprepared I was for so much awesome . All of the characters were great and I felt like I was transported to another world -LRB- or at least , this one in about 50ish years -RRB- . I did n't want the movie to end at all because it was just that great . I wish it had been much longer . The movie was serious and sad , but it was also very funny in parts . I really ca n't say enough good things about this movie . You 'll just have to experience it for yourself and see how great it is ! " ,10
" ADDICTIVE film , I 'm a regular user . There are so many excellent reviews for this movie , I do n't want to over gush . The story is clear , concise and engrossing . It brought me from giddy to mournful to aroused to disgusted . And I loved every minute of it . I left the theater at 3am bouncing down the sidewalk . Buy the soundtrack , it 's more mobile and just as enjoyable . If you have n't seen the film , visit the website , www.repo-opera.com to see the high quality video clips of the film and some pre-film clips . Currently REPO ! is not in all theaters , in fact it 's only in select theaters across the US and a few Canadian cities . Keep an eye on the REPO ! website to see when it 's playing near your city . Rumor says the DVD will be out in January . " ,10
" I Loved Repo ! The Genetic Opera . I have been hearing some quizzical reviews about this musical movie and I am unsure why ? It seems the bad reviews want to hate it and not giving it a chance , so I wanted to share my personal review that I 've been posting , pretty much everywhere ... My review : Recently , about two weeks ago , JUST heard about this movie . I have a bit of a handicap finding out about movies that come out into the world in `` selected theaters '' until it is to late , especially the cool horror flicks - but I FORTUNATELY have a friend that is up on everything and had to see this movie , so I was invited to come along to NYC and I am SOOOOO Glad he did . I have to say I really did n't hear about it before and he gave me a bit of a background to the plot so it sounded pretty damn cool . And being a musical - well , I was more than little skeptical for the most part , I was DRILLED as a child with the classic musicals -LRB- West Side Story , Sound of Music , Fiddler , etc. . . -RRB- . My mother is one to watch something she likes over and over and over and over and over again , so being a child subjected to what your Mother wants to watch with only one T.V. is kind of hard , shall I say it , a bit of TORTURE ... even though I 've come to appreciate musicals , I am VERY critical of them . Although I thought Sweeney Todd was pretty decent , there were moments where I wanted to fast forward while I rolled my eyes . Repo ! The Genetic Opera had , let me say , NO moments where I cringed or rolled eyes , this Movie is a piece of ART ! I LOVE this movie , absolutely 100 % LOVE this movie . The story is original , the music is KICK ASS and the Cinemaphotography is incredible , everything that was done with this musical movie flowed in the right spots and was awesome . I loved the cast of characters , have always been a BIG fan of Anthony Stewart Head since Buffy , and being introduced to Terrance Zdunich and his voice , OMG ! Amazing ... I am still swooning as I think of his baritone voice ... I do hope he makes some more music ... PLEASE ! ;-RRB- Sarah Brightman is , of course , always great to listen to she has one gorgeous voice . Alexa Vega - first time I 've ever heard of her she to has a great voice . I even did not mind Ms. Paris Hilton , she actually did a decent job -LRB- I was shocked -RRB- and they put her in just enough so you did like her -LRB- I know I am bad -RRB- , Bill Mosely hello ! Awesome ! , Ogre have to say I have n't heard of him before this , but great Character , and Paul Sorvino - excellent job - although a couple of moments through the movie I kept thinking of Goodfellas ... LOL ! Repo ! The Genetic Opera - an Excellent movie - and definitely MY TYPE OF MUSICAL ! LOL ! I hope to see it again , and again ! So if you are fortunate enough to live near the `` Selected '' theater it is in , go see it ! I do hope they can bring it to a theater in Philadelphia ... " ,10
" Repo ! The Genetic Opera . This movie is amazing ... I have been expecting this movie for a while and its while worth the wait ... The music , acting , and singing are all amazing . I was expecting Rotti 's kids and Graverobber to have bigger parts but i liked it how it was . . Anthony has an amazing voice , as does Paris , Paul , Terrance , and Alexa . Pretty much the whole cast have amazing voices . And they all are good actors . The way the movie was shot with the sets and clothing are also great . All in all this movie is really amazing . Its a well worth movie and I plan on seeing it again as well should a lot of you . repo-opera . com at least go to the site and give the trailer and movie clips a try . Testify !!! " ,10
" some may love it , and some just wont ... I definitely did n't . Sometimes a cult film just ca n't be made when it 's just made by `` whimsy '' or whatever to be so . Sometimes it works , like with Snakes on a Plane , but then other times we get a film that ends up dividing the audience so thickly that you can feel tension in the air during a screening . Luckily I watched Repo ! The Genetic Opera at home on DVD , so me and my wife had and took every chance to bemoan , groan , yell-at-the-screen and curse it to high heavens - I may have even thrown something like headphones at the TV - and did n't have to worry about other meddlesome audience members getting in the way . Because this was , to me at least , not something much enjoyable or memorable as a cult film . It 's not a complete failure , but something pretty much close to being , and it is not something I would ever want to watch again -LRB- how I got through it I ca n't quite explain here ... maybe blackouts ? -RRB- The filmmaker is Darren Lynn Bousman , responsible for a huge chunk of the Saw franchise , and here he continues his legacy of film-making that is pretty sickening to watch . He has some competent skills , like say knowing how to make BLAZING lights all over the place , or giving it the `` blue-tint '' look . So he tries , Lord he tries , and if that 's your game well then have at it . But it 's not much different in quality than the Saw movies except with ... a song . Or a bunch of them . Actually , that 's a lie ; as an opera , this is a case of people `` trying '' to sing - and good , accomplished singers like Anthony Stewart Head -LRB- who proved he could sing wonderfully on Buffy the Vampire Slayer -RRB- and Paul Sorvino -LRB- a TRAINED opera singer -RRB- tossed in with , well , Paris Hilton -LRB- best thing I can say ... her boobs grew ? -RRB- , and there are no real melodies , and if there are they have that grungy awfulness that makes Hot Topic look as bad as it probably is when it comes to these pre-manufactured pieces of industrial rock-dung . But , one should take my words with some measure of salt . At best , the music just is n't for me , and if others like some of the songs -LRB- or when they are songs -RRB- I can respect that . What I ca n't respect is film-making that ignores competent storytelling for a lot of nonsensical singing-when-should-be-talking . Since the title proclaims it to be an opera then that should be an indicator of how the style will reflect this description . Trouble is , there 's nothing there worthwhile in the opera category . Some of it is laughable , some of it completely unbearable , all around some hackneyed story that could have some level of simplistic pleasure -LRB- as far as these stories go , which by the way Saw fans , Bousman does his Saw 3 trick here of flashbacks as a means of making up for actually , you know , progressing the story meaningfully -RRB- . And as someone who can dig pointless and excessive violence when done right here it 's just done wrong , totally hackneyed there as well ... another word for hackneyed ? Just ... blah ? So , I guess , watch the trailer first . Maybe make a somewhat educated guess as to where to go . If loud and monotonous rock anthems that make Rocky Horror look like a cinematic marvel -LRB- which is more deservedly so if it is compared to this -RRB- topped with blue-tint cinematography and crappy CGI and songs that go nowhere , then here 's the ticket . But just in case here 's a few other things sort of in this vein you could -LRB- or should -RRB- watch instead : Buffy 's episode `` Once More , with Feeling '' where we see just how much better Head is comparatively -LRB- and , frankly , I blame this more on the creative team behind Repo than any lack in Head 's skills -RRB- , The Saddest Music in the World -LRB- which also tries for this crazy cinematic exercise in cult-in-the-making movie-making with music and works far better -RRB- , and ... and I ca n't believe I 'm writing these words : Paint Your Wagon . Period . " ,3
" Perfection on Screen ! . How could you not want to see this movie ? Everything about Repo ! the Genetic Opera is pure gold ; from the songs to the visuals and the plot to the characters . Each actor does such a great job . For all of you Paris haters , put the hate aside , this is her best role and no one could do a better job then her as Amber . Sarah Brightman is sublime in her first movie and once again highlights her versatility . Them two along with Alexa Vega , Anthony Stewart Head , Paul Sorvino , Ogre , Bill Mosely , and Terrance Zdunich take this cult classic to its height that creates a movie comparable to the amazingness that is Rocky Horror Picture Show . Everything about this movie is perfection on screen . There is an actor and character for everyone to like . Everyone must see this movie ! Lionsgate unfairly and wrongly gave this movie a limited release . Make up for this by either attending the Repo Tours with Darren and Terrance or order it online . I 'm not one to order things off the internet but when the movie was ready to pre-order , I broke out the credit card and ordered it on as fast as I could . You all should do the same . " ,10
" More Than A Film . Repo ! is somewhat of a phenomenon . The continuously bulldoze criticisms and Lionsgate Films by collecting devoted and ridiculously loyal fans from all over the globe . They thought there would be no audience for the theaters . -LRB- Repo ! continually sells out it 's Repo Road Tour stops -RRB- . It was supposed to be straight to DVD - Repo ! is now playing in over 20 theaters across the states and Canada , and it 's still growing . Repo defies everyone 's doubts . But enough of that ; there 's a reason it 's doing so well . The story is a a good one . It 's a tragedy and a drama , and watching the movie is a pleasure . Those who knew the words sung along in the theater , people dress up as the characters yada yada yada . But the concept of the movie , the universe , the characters and the way everything is connected , is amazing . That 's what makes this movie fantastic . The movie exceeds the film . There 's a way that every single character is connected by the actions of one character that has about as much screen time as an extra . The universe of Repo ! is a stretched version of something that is entirely possible . Organ sales and repossession are real , though they are not legal . The obsession with cosmetic surgery is real . The characters draw you in , their interaction draws you in , the plot spurs a spiderweb of subplots that prompt individual interpretation and thought . I loved Repo ! because of the intricacies of the characters , the concept of the world surrounding Shilo and Nathan\/Repo-Man , the dynamics of Marni 's butterfly effect on the two central families . All of it . I was reading the message boards for The Devil 's Rejects earlier , and I laughed out loud at one of the comments I saw . It was pitiful . It 's not an exact quote , but I 'm taking no liberties . ` When I watch a horror movie , I do n't want it to provoke thought . ' If that quote rings truth for you , then by god do not see this movie , or anything beyond the intelligence of Napoleon Dynamite . You will be sorely disappointed . On a final note , go see Repo ! . Form your own opinion . If Paris Hilton strikes fear and loathing in your heart , pretend she does n't . If gore irks you , well , I do n't really have anything for you . Except that the gore in this movie is always a `` OMFG I ca n't believe that I 'm watching this , this is freaking awesome ! '' . Pretend you do n't hate musicals , pretend you do n't hate Saw 2 through 4 , and just watch it . Do n't let anyone force an opinion on you , including prejudice . " ,10
" Dark , twisted , and just a pleasure I did n't expect . When I went to see this , I 'd only see two previews for it on the internet . I was intrigued by the dark music and the images . I was in for a treat . I LOVED the music , Anthony Head was perhaps one of my favorite singers in this movie . His voice was strong and he portrayed his character flawlessly . I also thoroughly enjoyed Terrance Zdunich , his voice was fun and he gave just enough creepy on the screen and you just got ta love his smile . The music was strong , fun , and dark , and was hands down my favorite aspect of this movie . All the characters were each enjoyable in their own right , the actors and actresses portraying them brought them all to life very well . You felt for Nathan Wallace over his dark secrets , strove for freedom with Shilo , and wanted Rotti to get his just rewards . Paris Hilton made a fun Amber Sweet who 's final embarrassment will make you laugh out loud . This movie is dark , funny , twisted , and not a mainstream pleasure . It makes me think of Blade Runner , 5th Element , Nightmare Before Christmas , and a number of other bizarre , futuristic , and dark movies . I can hardly wait until I finally get my copy of the soundtrack and in January , I will be owning the movie and then sharing it with everyone I know . One of my favorite movies ever but if you 're close-minded or expecting a Saw replica , this probably is n't for you . " ,10
" Our generations ' Rocky Horror Picture Show . I was lucky enough to see Repo at the SOLD OUT show in Boston . It is a sight and sound sensory overload of beauty and filth . The concept of this film was masterfully drawn , written , sung , and filmed by everyone involved , including Paris Hilton , to all you haters . Mainstream does n't understand this film , stage show , soundtrack , or culture that it is portraying . It brings life back into theaters , making a night at the movies and entertainment event , not just something to do when you 're bored . Making this film was a huge risk and sacrifice for Darren , Terrance , and everyone who has been working for over 10 years to share this fireball of passion , beauty , and darkness with true fans of originality . I hope this vision can continue to break barriers and will continue to unfold in the prequel and sequel . " ,10
" Girl goes out in search of a cure for her disease , and discovers many dirty secrets about the world around her . . -LRB- I apologize ; that summary does n't say nearly enough about the film . Wikipedia has a very in depth synopsis , although it will contain spoilers . -RRB- I have not had this much fun at a movie in so long . A modern rock opera , Repo included good acting -LRB- I 'm not a Paris Hilton fan , but she did perfectly fine in this movie , and I 'm sick of hearing about reviewers just following trends and bashing her instead of writing a proper review about this wonderful film , especially after learning that it 's sold out all 16 shows on its tour ! -RRB- sexy people , great catchy songs , intriguing , original plot lines , cool sets and costumes , and more . Much in the vein of Rocky Horror , they tend to do 10pm or midnight showings , to which people show up in costume and are extremely exuberant and friendly , singing along and calling things out during the show , which really only adds to the experience . I 'm eagerly awaiting the DVD . It was definitely on the gory side , but while I 'm normally upset by such things , I did fine with this movie , and really had a blast . I definitely recommend you go out and give it a try ! " ,10
" Great , original movie ! . Repo has had literally no backing by Lionsgate so few people have had a chance to see it unless they were lucky enough to live near a theater that the Repo roadshow has been to . I saw it in Boston at a sold out midnight screening . I must say the movie was excellent . Do n't listen to negative reviews . Form your own opinion . The style is not for everyone 's tastes . I truly think that this will become the next Rocky Horror where audience members will actively participate in the showings . People who had n't even seen the movie showed up in homemade costumes when I went . It is unfortunate that the same production company that pimped all the Saw movies was unwilling to advertise a movie that is actually original in style and quite frankly a lot less gruesome in comparison . " ,9
" Original , innovative , and AMAZING ! . First of all , i 'm sorry this movie has an audience , any person who is into music first of all will ADORE this movie , my roommate went with me and she is far from the audience and she enjoyed it because Sarah Brightman of course was amazing in it . Second , the fact that this was an original idea in a land of sequels , re-makes , and copy cats was shocking , it was Gothic rock musical , when in the hell was the last time you could put any of those together and say it was utterly amazing ?!?! Third , you 'd be shocked at the cast and how well they all worked off and with one another , Paris Hilton deserves to receive some credit because she was perfect in this role and Anthony Stewart Head was breathtakingly twisted and it fit so perfectly it was scary . For those of you who know nothing of this movie , do some research check out the myspace page , the facebook page , the website , do it all just check it out and trust me you 'll love it , and if you do n't , you 'll at least love the fact that it was an original thought coming out of Hollywood . " ,10
" Sure to be a Cult Classic . When this movie returns to New Orleans I will go see it again . The visual effects are comparable to movies with 10 times the budget . I went to see this movie just on the first two names . Darren Lynn Bousman , director of Saw 2 , 3 , and 4 . Also Paul Sorvino wonderful actor in Goodfellas , and until this movie , I never realized he had an operatic background . What really made my jaw drop was Sara Brightman 's role in this move . The special effects combined with her voice are just mesmerizing . When this movie gets rolling I can see it making the top 5 cult movie list . If this movie comes to your city\/town even if it is near you spend the time and money to go and see it . I can not wait for the DVD release . Leave the kids at home -LRB- this movie is rated R -RRB- , and show up with your Zydrate in your little glass vial ! This movie is a Rock Opera not a musical . " ,9
" Not for everybody but one of the greatest films . I went to the Chicago showing this is such a dark colorful morbidly fun movie . It 's so original that I can see why some people do n't like . Repo ! goes beyond the mainstream . You have to be a certain person to love this movie . But do n't bash it until you 've tried it . My friend , a semi preppy music major was not sold when I dragged her to go see . But by the end of the night even she was sold . I felt something watching this movie that I never felt before . As an audience member you can tell that everyone working on Repo ! was emotionally involved . You can tell that they were having fun and loved what they were doing . Repo ! the Genetic Opera is a fun movie . The only flaw is that it does seem choppy . The audience can tell that some story lines were cut . That was due to time restrictions . However , that can be over looked when you found out their low budget and that they only had a month to film . A month to film an opera ; I think they did wonderful . And yes , this is an opera not a musical . There is no talking only signing . I can go on so let me end by saying people seem to either love or hate this movie . But I dare you : If you 're able to see Repo ! see it . It might surprise you " ,10
" Never before have I written a review ... until now . . After reading past reviews of this movie , I decided to stay neutral until I saw it to form my own opinion . I thought it was going to be good , but I was prepared for it to be horrible . It looked to be one of those movies that could go either way . This movie is n't for everyone . Anyone who goes to see it trying to compare it to something is going to be disappointed . You CA N'T compare it anything . Repo ! is its own unique thing . The closest you could compare it to would be The Rocky Horror Picture Show because of the close community the fans have -LRB- although the movie is n't anything similar except they both have music and are outcasts -RRB- . The casting was superb . There was so much emotion in all of the characters that it drags you into their world . At first -LRB- having only seen the videos put out -RRB- I was n't a fan of hardly any of the characters , but after seeing the movie it was perfectly clear why they were all chosen for their parts . In the end of the movie I had tears in my eyes , which was something I had n't expected . Also the music that I did n't like before , seeing it in context in the movie , I loved it . They were catchy , despite what past reviews had said . The only thing I did n't like about the movie was there was NO talking ; everything was singing . It was talk-singing . I wished the talking bits had been just that and not tried to be put into music . Then again , it IS an Opera ... I must say that the sets and costumes were beautiful ! Who would have thought futuristic meets victorian would have worked so well ? The Repo team did and they were right ! Would I recommend this movie ? Yes . To all audiences -LRB- that can handle it as it contains major gore\/drug use\/sexual content -RRB- . Even if you 'd hate it , I 'd say go see it anyway . It 's something unique . There is n't anything else like it out there ; you should see it just to be able to say , `` I saw a musical about a repo man that collects organs . '' However , it may surprise you just as it did me . I moved from my neutral stand point to huge fan ! " ,9
" It was worth every penny , every minute , every ounce of love and passion poured into it . I was lucky enough to get tickets to the Orlando showing of Repo ! The Genetic Opera as the last stop of the first Repo Road Tour . For those who are n't aware , the director Darren Lynn Bousman and co-creator\/friendly neighborhood grave-robber Terrance Zdunich paid out of pocket to take Repo ! on tour around the country . Seven cities in seven days with the tag line `` It 's not just a movie ... it 's an EVENT '' . And it was . We showed up at the Enzian Theater at 4pm and sat at the Eden bar , prepared to enjoy ourselves for six hours while we waited for the movie to start . We met people who were members of the discussion forums -LRB- www.repo-opera.com\/board -RRB- , and we met people who did n't know the boards existed . We talked it up with several people and helped others secure their standby tickets . -LRB- standby tickets were handed out so that if there was room after the actual ticket holders were seated , they could purchase a ticket to get in . -RRB- Oh , that 's something I forgot to mention . The show was sold out 2 1\/2 weeks prior to the show-date . I walked into the theater knowing only 2 things for certain : 1 -RRB- I love the soundtrack . 2 -RRB- I 've been waiting for this film for months and was very active in promoting it . I hoped like hell that I did n't talk a bunch of people into spending $ 15 to see a truly crappy movie . I did n't have to worry about point number two - Repo is FAR better than `` the worst movie of the year '' \* cough \* tropicthunder \* cough \* There are so many things I could talk about , but you do n't need a novel . You need to know what to expect without getting details ... so here 's the deal . The ONLY thing you really need as a potential audience member is an open mind . The following are some items that can help you open it , just in case . What Every Person Interested in Repo Should Know Repo is NOT a musical . It can not be accurately described as `` Rocky Horror meets Blade Runner . '' I 'm sorry , but whoever said that did this film a serious disservice . -LRB- Darren , if it was you , I 'm doubly sorry -RRB- It 's nothing like Rocky . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with Rocky Horror - I love that movie too , but it is known for the oddities , the sexually taboo -LRB- well , at least for the times -RRB- and so on . Repo is , as the name infers , an opera . A rock opera . Repo is NOT a mainstream movie . It is n't going to resemble much of anything you 've ever seen before -LRB- unless you were lucky enough to have witnessed any of the many stage performances since the story of the Repo Man emerged from the minds of Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich -RRB- . Some of you might even see this movie and hate it ! Because it 's a grass roots project , it had a low budget . The only criticism I could think to offer about Repo was that the editing was a bit choppy - mostly because due to budget constraints they had to cut out an HOUR 'S worth of material ! I ca n't wait to see it again on the big screen , but my biggest hope is to get a fully-featured director 's cut of the film , with EVERYTHING they have in the archives . I had a big tweak of disappointment because I did n't want it to end ! I wanted more ! More Shilo ! More of the Largos ! More Blind Mag ! And of course , because he 's my favorite , MORE ASH ! -LRB- Anthony Stewart Head -RRB- My hope is that , if you 're like many of the people who will neighbor you in the theater , you will be excited and intrigued by the unknown . By the possibility to see something original . Something artistic and emotional . Something that had thousands of people waiting to get in on chance over the course of a one week tour . Something that had people driving from hours away to see , in costume , because they wo n't get the chance in their home town . Some could n't even see it in their state . And of course there is the two stories of those fans who flew in - one to the Chicago showing from Paris , France and one to our Orlando showing from Puerto Rico . The best way to learn more is to visit the film 's official website at www.repo-opera.com . You may get to see a couple clips online , and get a copy of the soundtrack , but you wo n't get the full scope of the film 's true EXPERIENCE until you see it and make your own decision . Probably the most humbling point of the evening was that Darren and Terrance took questions from the audience and made this plain : Their goal is not to make you love it , and manufacture a following . They encourage you to talk about the movie , whether you loved it or hated it . I loved it . " ,10
" A unique film that 's well worth seeing . Forget what most of the reviewers are saying . It 's got some high tech floating billboards and a sci-fi futuristic setting , but it 's nothing like Blade Runner . It 's got a lot of singing and a dark macabre tone , but it 's nothing like Sweeney Todd . And it 's not like Rocky Horror , either . It 's really not like anything else you 've probably seen . It is , in fact , that rare and elusive beast - the unique original effort . The concept of organ repossession is something you might hear exhausted doctors and nurses talk about after a bad night of call , but no one that I know of has put it up on a big screen before now . And the creators managed to set up a world where the idea is even plausible . Bizarre as it is , they make it easy to suspend disbelief and get into the story . There 's no question it 's a low budget movie , but in this case , low budget did not translate into `` cheap '' . The effects are surprisingly well done , given the money they had . If you go into this movie expecting quality on par with Sci-Fi channel original movies or the post apocalyptic offerings of the 80 's , you will be in for a very pleasant shock . Some people have a problem with the comic book style exposition sequences . Apparently they were a necessity being the mother of invention kind of thing . They just did n't have the money to shoot all the scenes they wanted to . But they work very well and help move a very complex story along without dragging . The music is probably a love it or hate it kind of deal . It 's made as an opera , not a musical , and most of the dialog is sung or talk\/sung . I thought it was cool , but if you 're not into that , you might find it annoying . The music is not , as so many are claiming , repetitive . To someone who does n't like this kind of music , it might all sound the same , but really , the score is fantastic . There are a couple songs that do n't really seem to work , and a couple that are good but do n't quite mesh with the film , but there are also some sequences that are just outstanding . Overall , it 's an an experience akin to watching a good stage performance . In the end , what makes or breaks a movie are the performances , and there were some amazing ones in this film . Everyone wants to talk about Paris Hilton , so let 's just get her out of the way . Whether she was acting or just playing herself , she was perfect for her role and did a great job . And even though she figures prominently in the teasers , she 's really not in the movie all that much . Alexa Vega does a fantastic job , both in her acting and her singing . Anthony Stewart Head gives the most outstanding performance in the film as mild mannered Nathan\/savagely brutal Repo Man . He manages to play them as two almost distinct individuals , including a brief scene where he switches rapidly back and forth . This could very easily have come off as a bad parody of Gollum , but Head handled it masterfully . And he is given plenty of opportunity to showcase his excellent singing voice . Sarah Brightman takes over the screen as Blind Mag for her all too brief appearances . Terrance Zdunich 's Graverobber serves as narrator , and , again , does a great job for the brief time he is actually on screen . Which brings us to the film 's major shortcoming . A lot of complex characters are introduced , hang around long enough to get you interested in them , then disappear before they can be fully developed . Graverobber and Blind Mag , especially , needed a lot more screen time . That aside , though , this was a great movie . It wo n't appeal to everyone . It 's clearly not intended to . But if the crowd in Seattle is any indication , there are a lot of people who would love to see it . It 's a shame it 's had such a limited release . At least there 's the DVD to look forward to .

" Uniquely Wonderful . REPO : The Genetic Opera I want to start out by saying I loved this movie . I had been hearing the hype for over a year and kept following because it sounded more and more interesting . When the Repo Road Tour finally happened I was excited to see Kansas City on the list . -LRB- I did n't find out until a week before KC is Darren Bousman 's hometown -RRB- There have been several movies , High Tension and the Machinist come to mind , that I 've have heard hype for and wound up being disappointed in , so I was still hesitant . I picked up the soundtrack a week before the showing anyway , and was surprised that I loved it all by itself . So now going into the movie I was extremely excited and it did not disappoint . The songs were all great , the effects \/ look was as realistic as you could hope for in a sci-fi movie , the gore is gory but only when it was needed , not just there to shock people , and it was a heartwarming , but sad story . It almost had a Shakespearian type feel to it . I have now been listening to the soundtrack daily and am dying to see this again . My only real negatives are that the song `` Seventeen '' , while a good song , feels a little out of place in the movie , especially the way it was shot , and at first I was worried it would have a music video feel to it . The first few scenes jump to several different shots while the character is singing the same note -LRB- ex sitting at the end of the hall , walking down the hall , looking out the window , all in the coarse of two or three words -RRB- but that stops very early in the movie and the camera stays back and lets the performers perform . By the end , those little nit picking things do nothing to diminish an Amazing movie experience . This is probably a rambling review , but I ca n't express how pleased I was with this movie and I ca n't recommend it highly enough . The soundtrack can stand alone , the movie , if it was just spoken , I think would be great , but together they make the most uniquely wonderful movies I 've seen in a long time , maybe ever . " ,10
" the `` Not Your Parent 's Opera '' is for everyone , including your parents . . Although Repo ! claims to be ` not your parents opera ' Repo ! is for your parents , and you friends , professors , and the man at the gas station . Mixed with humor , gore , and amazing vocal performances this film is far more than even the posters can explain . My father took me to see my first rock opera when I was 8 -LRB- Jesus Christ Superstar -RRB- , and so I returned the favor and brought him to Repo ! The fans are not just opera , or horror fans , nor are they all goths or emos . Couples older than my father sat next to college students with gadges large enough to stick a bottle cap in . This is more than your average film , this is THE film of the year , and the best musicly based film of the decade . The songs are impossible to get out of your head , and the acting is beyond the latest ocsar winner 's standards . When they hand out awards in Hollywood this year , I hope and pray they do n't forget this diamond amongst the sequels and triquels that Hollywood is producing . Afterwards my father told me that this was the same theater he saw the first ever Rock Opera film , Tommy ! I am proud to say that I am able to follow my father and see the greatest Rock Opera -LRB- film -RRB- of my decade , and I will treasure my ticket stub for the rest of my life . " ,10
" A truly unique movie that leaves you wanting to see more !! . As an avid Anthony Stewart Head fan , I found out about this movie through his website and could n't wait to see it . I bought the soundtrack and was able to see the film Monday night ... WOW !!! This movie is truly unique and one of the best rock operas I 've ever seen . One of the other reviews here mistakenly calls it a `` musical '' , it is n't , it truly is an opera where you have very little in the way of spoken dialog . The music is driving , intense , yet tender , and very memorable . The same can be said of this movie . Granted , this is a horror movie as well and therefore may not be for the squeamish or faint of heart . The only thing I could wish for this movie would be to see the original 2 + hour long version , so that more of the details of the story could be seen . Ca n't wait for the director 's cut comes to DVD . :--RRB- " ,9
" excellent ! . Repo ! the genetic Opera , Repo ! for short . First off , if you like rock , drama , violence , gore , Gothic themes , or dark comedies , this is for you . From reading the title , I thought it would be about a bunch of kids avoiding the repo man like some futuristic Jason rip-off . I was wrong . The plot is amazing ! It deals with more with drama than violence but still delivers . Basic plot - In the future , disease sweeps the world . Organs fail . But , out of the tragedy , a savior emerges , GeneCo . The owner , Rotti Largo and his 3 twisted kids . -LRB- excellent characters -RRB- A girl , Shilo lives alone with her father , Nathan . She has a blood disease and can not go out side . unknown to her , the supposedly doctor of a dad is the repo man forced to work as punishment after he accidentally killed his wife . The movie deals with her seeking her cure and coming of age even if it means disobeying dad . The rip-off of this movie , repo men , is predictable to the point of being boring . yes , I can call it a rip-off . Repo ! started as a stage play in early 2000 's . The book for repo men was started in 2003 . There is no way the producers of Repo ! could get their hands on a copy and the similarities are too much to be coincidence . The only explanation is stealing the ideas . If you want insane characters , drama , rock , and not just action and violence , the choice is easy . You may not like all the songs in the film but do you always like every song on CD 's you buy ? The point , Repo ! has a little of everything . Not all people like songs in movies but I think it is still better than another Hollywood sell out , remake of a good movie that does not deserve being destroyed , and slasher films only differing with the killers costume . It 's a cult film , meaning not for everyone . But if you can deal with singing and gore , go for it . If it 's not you , take it back to the store and move on . " ,10
" Never Seen Anything Like it ! . This is the first time I have ever written a review like this for a movie , but for this one , I felt i needed to because the critics are all wrong . Now , I am not going to go into the story of REPO ! because their are plenty of other places one could find that . So here is my review : THE STORY - 10\/10 - I never expected this movie to be so deep and layered as it is . There are multiple twists , some sad moments , and some things that are utterly amazing ! The story is so deep and immense , I have no complaints on this end . The story was very good . That 's all I can say . THE CHARACTERS - 8.5 \/ 10 - I am giving the characters an 8.5 \/ 10 not because I did n't like them , but because they were n't as developed as they could gave been . Now , I understand that the movie had to be cut , but still . I still like ALL the characters though . THE MUSIC - 9.5 \/ 10 - For the most part , the music is very good . My only complaint is that some of the lyrics were odd ... An example ? `` Dad , there were these bodies ... they were all dead ! '' . Haha That made me laugh . THE VISUALS - 10\/10 - This movie was made for something like less than 10 million dollars . These visuals are so mind-blowing that I could n't imagine what they would have been like if this movie had a bigger budget . The lighting was really cool too . IN CONCLUSION , see this movie . You may hate it , but at least see its originality . Movies like this are hard to find nowadays , and they are few and far between . So please , see this . 9.5 \/ 10 " ,10
" Rocky Horror of our generation ? . If someone would have told me years ago that a movie starring , Alexa Vega , Paris Hilton , and several other people I have little or no interest in other than Bill Mosely that it would have become a must have for me , I would have laughed in their face . Repo ! is an instant classic from beginning to end . There is just no weak points in this movie . The weakest points of the movie are still strong , keeping you compelled to want to unravel this unique and incredible story . But if you have not seen it , the premise of the story is simple . In a not so distant future , surgery , much like plastic surgery , has swept over the world . You can now finance organs , or anything you desire for the human anatomy . But what comes of this legalized repossession , or in other words , legalized assassination to get the organs back after 90 days of delinquency . I will leave it at that , for most of the story would be spoiling an amazing experience down this twisted and creative road . Now the story is just great as is , but the singing is where this movie truly shines . Personally , I found myself listening to every song constantly days after seeing the film . Each song is so unlike anything I have ever heard and distinct in difference , and they all shine through . Some are more twisted , others humorous , though they all are great and compose a great story along with perfect acting . The acting of the movie surprised me the most . I am not a fan of Paris Hilton , not at all . However even she blew me away in this movie . Others like Alexa Vega , who honestly I thought would be a horrible edition , were amazing as well . You felt part of the story , living in this world and watching them tell a story through actions alone . Anthony Stewart was my favorite character of the movie , I will not post why and leave that mystery for you to find out yourself . Each character is different and yet , they are alike in some morbid way or another . In a short summary , this movie to me is the Rocky Horror of our generation . Fans of musicals will find this an impressive film and great addition to any movie collection . Those who are not interested in the musical aspect , I still encourage you to rent this film . I think if given a chance , this movie will surprise some of the biggest critics out there . Easily one of the best films I ever had the privilege of seeing . " ,9
" Haunting Rock Musical . Repo is haunting in the same vein as Sweeney Todd . But even more , the plot is original , the acting good and the music great . The basic premise for the Repo : The Genetic Opera is organ financing . Human organs have been failing , and many people do not have the money to fund their own transplants . GeneCo offers to finance , then transplant organs into failing bodies . When their customer 's do n't pay , GeneCo sends a Repo man to foreclose on their organs . While this is the setting , the story is about the people in this world more than the world itself . Alex Vega 's voice is excellent as the ill daughter ; Anthony Head plays her father and is riddled with conflict . And do n't be afraid of Paris Hilton - her character is perfectly in line with her tabloid image ; she pulls it off perfectly . Motifs of free will , guilt and rampant capitalism run throughout this film . To sum it all up , Repo ! A Genetic Opera is a hauntingly intriguing rock opera . NOTE : Not for those sensitive to blood . " ,9
" An Amazing ride of a movie . I ca n't understand why this movie did n't get a bigger push by the studio ! I 've seen Repo ! 3 times so far , and will probably watch it a hundred more now that I 've picked up the DVD . The movie not only holds up , but gets better each time . Yes , it 's a musical . Yes , it 's violent in places . Yes , it 's campy . But , somehow all of those elements stew in the pot just right to create a fantastic blend . The music to Repo is amazing on it 's own right and Terence Zdunich and Darren Smith really deserve some kudos for it . The tunes go through an amazing range of styles from operatic to rock to industrial and even a few more traditional `` musical '' moments . It really helps , though , to listen to the soundtrack before seeing the movie because then you 're more focused on actually watching what 's going on instead of simply trying to catch the song . Visually the movie is superb . Despite having a limited budget , the film pulls off a Gothic noir aesthetic like few others and use well rendered computer graphic for extra touches here and there to fill out the world a bit better . The entire visual pallet is cohesive though from the cinematography -LRB- in a world where there appears to be no sun -RRB- so some down right awesome costume designs . The cast , though , is the piece that holds it all together . Anthony Stewart Head of Awesome !! as Nathan Wallace\/Repo followed closely by Terence Zdunich as the ever charismatic GraveRobber . The rest of the cast are all great in their own right and will no doubt prompt `` I never knew they could sing '' more than once . Heck , even Paris Hilton is good in this -LRB- god , I never thought I 'd hear myself say that -RRB- . If you have any doubts , just move past them and give Repo ! a chance . It really got buried by the studio and needs all the fan support it can get . It deserves far better than it 's been given . " ,10
" Amazing Movie ! . Repo ! The Genetic opera is is amazing . It 's twisted , dark , funny , bloody , and has great music , in short , everything I love in a good movie . The singing is great , I mean I knew Anthony Stuart Head could sing from the Buffy musical episode , I knew Paul Sorvino had an incredible voice and well Ogre is Ogre -LRB- Skinny Puppy -RRB- love his voice too , but I would have never guessed that Alexa Vega could sing , the same holds true for Paris Hilton . I had heard of Terrance Zdunich -LRB- co-creator and plays Graverobber -RRB- from a friend of mine who tried very hard to get me to see Repo ! The Genetic Opera when it was on the stage . Regrettably , I never got to see it and I wish I had . To see Terrance Playing Graverobber live would have been wonderful to see . This movie is not for everyone , think of it as a cross between Blade Runner and Rocky Horror , but for the 21st Century . I 'm not just saying this because I 've been fortunate enough to go to Repo ! Road Tour 2 and 3 and have met Darren Lynn Bousman , Terrance Zdunich and Alexa Vega . Even if I 'd had not met them , I 'd still love this movie , the fans that have supported and actually advertised it , got it into all the theaters that it 's been in by word of mouth alone , the fact that this movie was not created to sit and watch like other movies , but they want\/expect you to yell callbacks , sing with the movie , dance and just have fun ! I 've seen this movie twice in the theaters BOTH times I 've driven over 4 hours to see it . I 'd do it all again . " ,10
" Testify ! . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a visceral feast for the eyes and the ears . Its draws you into a future where surgery is fashionable , people are addicted to Zydrate -LRB- The 21st Century Cure -RRB- and everyone has concerns over being visited by the REPO Man . This rock opera hits you where you are most vulnerable . It is a gory musical ride that grabs you by the jugular and does n't let go until after the credits are done with . Once the music stops and the ride is over , you ca n't wait to experience it again . A dark world inhabited by colorful characters . Created by Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich , who both grace the screen as the energetic Bandleader and the charismatic Graverobber . Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman who is well known for his work in the SAW films . And one can not leave out the incredible cast . Paul Sorvino as Rotti Largo , the father and creator of GeneCo . Bill Moseley , Ogre and Paris Hilton play Rotti 's three deranged and spoiled offspring ; Luigi , Pavi and Amber Sweet . Anthony Stewart Head kills as the REPO man . Sarah Brightman truly is the voice of GeneCo . And Alex Vega as young Shilo Wallace The fans have spoken . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a must have . While drawing some comparisons to the Rocky Horror Picture Show , Repo ! The Genetic Opera stands out . It is a fresh new look and feel for musicals of 21st Century . It is joyously alive , invigorating and truly epic . At the end of the movie you will found yourself asking : Would you change who you are if you could ? " ,10
" A visually dazzling musical for deaf people . . Looks good , and a good idea , but the music is lousy . It 's composed almost entirely of those tuneless dialogue\/exposition scenes that make up the boring bits of all the great musicals you 've seen , all the same tone , level and mood , and none of the tunes you leave the theater humming . Watch Dr Horrible 's Singalong Blog , and you pick up the songs immediately . Not so with this . A sadly wasted opportunity . Most of the cast are fine , but Alexa Vega 's surprisingly weak . It 's a shame , because cinema 's crying out for something different like this , and the more failures we have like this the less likely it will be that they take off . I notice a lot of people are comparing it with Rocky Horror , which is apt , because that 's another film loved by people who want to belong to something . But at least that has some songs you can hum . " ,4
" Repo ! The Experience . Picture a future in which surgery is a necessity for some and a career for others . A world exists where the industries of health and science have become greedy an obsessed with offering perfection at high cost . Sound familiar ? The world of Repo ! The Genetic Opera may not be as futuristic and far-fetched as its creators intended . Whether this is good or bad becomes irrelevant as the audience is carried into a fantasy world richly designed by co-creators Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich . The gore-factor of film and dark tone certainly appeals to fans of director Darren Lynn Bousman 's previous works -LRB- the Saw films -RRB- . At its core the plot gives unique homage to classic Baroque era opera , blending campy humor with the exploration of a young heroine 's tragic quest . In the year 2056 GeneCo has developed a way to provide refuge from the global outbreak of organ failure . They monopolize the provision of necessary transplants and addictive painkillers . Soon the people become addicted to the process of surgery and the appeal of having more\/better features than anyone else . Average men and women become drug addicts and `` scalpel sluts '' . The surgeries go from needs to wants creating a society of individuals spending beyond their means for a superfluous breast augmentation or a face lift while GeneCo reaps the benefits of those willing to pay the high price . However , if you fail to make payments , the Repo Man will repossess your organs . Terrance Zdunich stars as a grave robbing drug dealer acts as a narrator who guides the audience through the evolution of GeneCo . The plot focuses on young Shilo -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- , the daughter of Dr. Nathan Wallace -LRB- Anthony Stewart Head -RRB- , who was born with a rare blood disease . When the founder of GeneCo , Rotti Largo -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- is diagnosed with a terminal illness he begins searching for the heir to his fortune . His own children disappoint him and he has little time to find a suitable replacement . Paris Hilton is Amber Sweet , a spoiled heiress and veritable parody of the typical media portrayal Hilton 's personal life . `` Amber Sweet is addicted to the knife '' , the grave robber informs Shilo in one of the films most memorable musical numbers -LRB- Zydrate Anatomy -RRB- . Amber and her brothers Pavi -LRB- Ogre from Skinny Puppy -RRB- and Luigi -LRB- Bill Moseley -RRB- constantly clash over who is to inherit GeneCo . The film boasts a unique cast , ranging from newcomers such as Zdunich to seasoned horror veterans like Bill Moseley . One of the films greatest strengths and weaknesses is the addition of stage diva Sarah Brightman . Her performance is incredible but the role is lacking in screen time for talent of her magnitude . Audiences can expect the unexpected when viewing musical talent such as Brightman and Skinny Puppy 's Nivek Ogre . Many of the films musical numbers bring to mind acts such as Tom Waits and Lacuna Coil . Music producer Joseph Bishara used a wide range of session musicians to accomplish a sound unlike any other movie musical of our time . Repo ! elbows its way into the horror and sci-fi genres as an excellent example of inspired work . This movie has been compared to the likes of cult classics such as Rocky Horror Picture Show because of its underground favor . It 's not hard to see why if you 've been to a screening . The audience participation encouraged by the cast and crew reinforces the relationship not typically seen between a film 's creators and its target demographic . Director Darren Lynn Bousman encourages participants to get out and talk about the film , whether they liked it or not . Fans of horror , science fiction , and musical theater can appreciate the film for its ingenuity and refreshing story . Repo ! The Genetic Opera offers audiences a break from the standard Hollywood cat scare tripe offered up in the fall season . The success of the film seems largely dependent on an active message board and fan-based marketing . With the increased popularity of viral marketing campaigns emerging from late 90 's independent horror film The Blair Witch Project , it 's interesting to see advertisement controlled primarily by the films fan base . It is easier to measure the success of a film when its popularity is not falsified by big budget advertising . After viewing a screening audience members should feel inspired to spread the word and hopefully garner a national release for the film . If nothing else viewers will at least go home knowing they 've never seen anything like it before . " ,9
" A Unique , gripping experience . - First the costumes . OMG I can not stress enough how much I loved the costume design in the movie . - The setting for the movie was amazing and really gave that feel of glimpsing into another world . Nothing I could notice distracted from the feel of the movie , only added to it . - The sound : I did notice the sync off at parts , but other than in the first few moments it was such a small bad in comparison to how glued to the movie . I stopped noticing it pretty quickly , but honestly there will be people out there that such a thing will ruin the experience for them . I implore the people who will judge the rest of the movie off this error to look past it and keep an open mind . You 'll loose out by being so quick to judge . - the cast : another thing to OMG about . I loved the cast and was very impressed . Anthony was amazing in his moments of switching between the father and the monster . To me nobody 's acting distracted from the movie . The singing was also amazingly done . - the editing : overall the editing was good , minus the few sync issues . There were a couple cuts between scenes that were a little awkward , but they did n't cause me to loose the feel of the movie . - Dialogue : I ca n't remember any line that I would have preferred not hearing . I enjoyed it all . - Concept : two words come to mind `` absolutely brilliant '' I was hooked on the concept of the movie since the first time I viewed anything on it , which was during the scream awards -LRB- I believe that was the awards ceremony -RRB- . Overall I loved the movie and even if it 's not the type of movie you think you 'd normally see , I recommend making the decision to see it . It is such a unique experience . If you enjoy horror movies , musicals , or even have been thinking that all the movies you 've seen lately are n't original then you must see it . Do n't wait for the DVD and do n't watch it for free online somewhere . It 's so much funner to experience with a large audience . I 'm not going to say they you have to think it 's the best movie ever , that 's all a matter of individual opinion , but I do n't think anyone can in all honesty call this movie the worst movie ever . I can name many movies that have been so bad it was hard to even sit through 5 mins of it . I can name movies that are nowhere near as original . I can name many movies where people have walked out the theater thinking they have just wasted their money . From my viewing last night I did n't hear a single person complaining that they wished they did n't watch it . I did however hear a lot of people complimenting the movie in one way or another . So please if you have n't seen it already , or had thought that it was n't exactly for you , see it . Even if you walk out of the theater thinking it was n't the best movie , you 'll at least know that you will have just seen something unique and special . A movie that was made with passion and love and not one that was made just to bring in money . If you have seen it definitely tell others about . If you loved it , tell others why . If you hate it do n't just say you hate it and leave it at that . Tell people why cause the reasons you hated it could be things other people are interested in and do n't make others miss out on something they might love just cause you did n't like it . And lastly those of you who I hear thought you were interested until you heard Paris was in it . See it . She does not take away from the movie . She does very well , so get past the dislike and see it " ,10
" A Must See . There are many things that one might think of when they hear the words `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' Let me tell you that after seeing this film , I can attest that everything you might think you know is incorrect . I have been following the film since its sneak peak in Comic Con . Going into the film I had already spoken with the creators , heard the soundtrack , reviewed the 10-minute opera that inspired it , and yet this film still managed to catch me completely off guard with its plot 's twists and turns , it 's characters , it 's ambiance . The intricacies of the storyline flow flawlessly through a world of surgery and drug addiction , of broken hearts and dreams , of character flaws and severely disturbed individuals . The cast was impeccable at capturing the details of their character 's conflicts while expressing themselves with out most finesse through music . This film is , quite frankly , an epic culmination cinematic art . Everything from the sets , the special effects , the story , the music , the actors , the conflict development , and the wardrobe is perfect . Everybody behind Repo ! The Genetic Opera worked extremely hard for it , and it shows . Do n't like horror movies ? Go see it . Hate Paris Hilton ? Go see it . Do n't like musicals ? Go see it . The plot confuses you ? Go see it . Do n't like gore ? Go see it . Repo has something to appeal to everybody . As I wandered outside the theater , I realized what a diverse crowd this movie is bringing . Everyone from elder Sarah Brightman enthusiasts , to angsty teenagers in love with Skinny Puppy , to socialite-wannabes adoring Paris Hilton congregated to enjoy this film , and boy is it something to enjoy ! In short , do n't shun Repo ! The Genetic Opera . Whatever prejudice or preconception you have of this movie I assure you will change once you see it . Absolutely amazing and a MUST see ! " ,10
" An Incredible Marriage of Grand Guignol , Greek Tragedy and Music Spectacle . Words can not do justice to the experience of this movie . It 's a heady fever dream that has to be processed and reviewed - and re-viewed again in order to come close to understanding the masterpiece that is REPO . Both Anthony Head and Terrance Zdunich turn in hauntingly unforgettable performances that are both incredibly nuanced and full of intensity . The music is quality . Quality , quality , quality . The world Bousman has created is complete and visually arresting . Alexa Vega 's performance is an incredible blend of vulnerability and strength . In other words , it 's more than a movie - it 's an event - an one I hope to repeat as soon as possible . " ,10
" The most mind-blowing original film this decade !!!! . Where do i begin with this film . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is by far one of the most mesmerizing awesome films i have ever seen . It literally is my number 1 favorite movie of all time . It will probably be another 17 years before i find another movie that STICKS OUT the way this one does . Repo ! is not a sequel , Repo ! is not a remake , Repo ! is ORIGINAL NEW . That should give it some kudos right there . Let 's talk about the film-making , Darren Lynn Bousman -LRB- Saw 2-4 -RRB- made this film on a -LRB- by Hollywood standards -RRB- shoe string budget of about 8-10 million and the film looks like a high budget blockbuster ! It has STYLE and looks extremely professional . The films lighting and shot composition creates a mood and an ATMOSPHERE that entices you to want to keep watching the film , it keeps you in a constant state of `` Holy sh \* t what is going to happen next ?! '' . It is simply amazing what Darren has accomplished . The acting was also AMAZING , all the actors completely got lost in their roles , in the way that you watch this movie and do n't even realize you are seeing Bill Mosley stab a Gentern , or seeing OhGr -LRB- The lead singer of Skinny Puppy -RRB- wearing Paris Hiltons face , or that you are seeing Paris Hilton in it at all ! Every actor played their roles FLAWLESSLY , it 's like they are real and that the movie is a portal to another dimension rather than just simply `` a movie '' . The music ! The music in this film spans every possible musical genre except Hip-hop and Country -LRB- no one likes them though , no offense , but come on -RRB- . It is rock , it 's opera , it 's metal , it 's goth , it 's punk , the list goes on . With a crew of musicians so long i wo n't even begin to bore you with that list , this film just oozes originality and sex appeal from the speakers . The music is great in how , even though each song is very different , it all flows together amazingly and seems to fit like pieces to a puzzle . My personal favorite song -LRB- and self proclaimed theme song of Repo ! -RRB- is the song `` We Started This Opera Sh \* t ! '' That song basically sums up the fun and camp of this movie , and this movie sure as hell is a lot of fun . The story ! This films story is deeper than i expected upon first hearing about it . It has LAYERS upon LAYERS of character back-story -LRB- told through extremely well drawn comic strips by writer and actor who plays Graverobber in the film , Terrence Zdunich -RRB- . The film was written by Darren Smith and Terrence Zdunich who also wrote the original stage play . This story has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a movie . It 's beautiful , it 's heartbreaking , it 's horrific ... again , the list goes on . Overall , this movie is something that can -LRB- and must -RRB- be seen by everyone , it is literally every genre rolled into one -LRB- thus making Repo ! it 's own genre in my opinion -RRB- . It is opera , it is a musical , it is horror , it is camp , it is comedy , it is action , it is romance , it is thrilling , it is DRAMATIC ! If the ending of this film does n't have you whipping tears from your eyes , you have no soul . This , again , is one of the most amazing films you will ever see . Whether you love it or hate it , it is worth seeing because it is just such an out there experience . Even if you see this movie and hate it to the core , you wo n't forget it for a long time . Go see Repo ! The Genetic Opera . " ,10
" Repo - sex , blood and opera 'n roll . It 's been a while since I saw Repo ! on the Fantasy Film Fest in Frankfurt , but nevertheless I love this movie . Before I entered the room number 6 in the cinema where REPO ! screened I noticed more and more black-clad figures around - including some with Skinny-Puppy Shirts . Lets just say I had an idea which movie they wanted to see . I was a little skeptical if I would understand everything - like most Germans I 'm used to dubbed movies and this one did n't even have subtitles - but that was n't a problem since it 's spoken and sung pretty clearly . The story at first seems to bounce around a lot but in the end it comes together . The songs are n't so easy to the ears like your ordinary pop-songs , but they totally suck you into the story , and the actors just fit for the characters -LRB- I tend to call Paris Hilton a limited singer but that 's just perfect for Amber Sweet -RRB- . Nathan Wallace or the Repo-Man - both are maniacs in their own way , two sides of a broken man who would do anything to protect his daughter . And after seeing the Largo-siblings a lot of parents surely had some hugging to do , since their own children are oh-so-normal and nice . This movie does n't have a problem with clich s - it just dances in the their entrails , from the spoiled rich brat to the anger-filled brother , heartless mogul and the shy , unworldly girl . Those are mixed with an evil humor that 's just fine with me but left the guy next to me moaning : `` They did not just do that ! '' Of course they did . And guessing from the reaction of the audience , that was fine with most of them . Loved it and wanted to see it again . Unluckily I do n't think it would have a big chance outside of something like the fantasy film fest , since people are so used to dubbing , which would totally destroy the songs . The Original Version with subtitles while they sang was accepted with a big blockbuster like Sweeney Todd , but that 's really an exception.So I guess I 'll have to wait for the DVD . " ,9
" `` So Good , The Audience Applauded ! '' . Repo ! The Genetic Opera Review-University of Maryland Prescreening `` So Good The Audience Applauded ! '' First off , I will come clean and admit that I do not like musicals . Regardless , I can not remember a time that I was in a theater and heard an applause after a film . This was an exception for Repo ! The Genetic Opera . It was evident before the film started that people were excited . I overheard discussions about the soundtrack , which were all positive while in line . This is impressive when considering that the film has received little if any promotion from its film company . It seems that it has been too long since there has been a movie made for a creative minded audience who wants more than a film , an experience . I kid you not , people were dressed up for this event ! I had brought a friend to come see the film , mind you , she primarily listens to rap and I on the other hand listen to mostly classical music . My favorite movie has always been Titanic , so it is no surprise that I would be nervous when the movie started that I would n't like it . A Rock Opera ? How good could that Be ? Boy was I wrong ! I have heard people describe the movie as a mix between Blade Runner and Rocky Horror . Well I have never seen Blade Runner and quite frankly , thought Rocky Horror was just weird . I think the beauty of Repo ! , is that it seems to appeal to a much larger audience . I do think that Rocky Horror fans would die to see this film though . I mean , they are probably getting tired of the same film decade after decade . Repo ! has something new to offer , as well as great actors , camera work , MUSIC , and a great story . The film is the child of Darren Lynn Bousman , the creator of the SAW movies , and he really outdid himself this time . It is very difficult to say much about the movie without spoiling it other than a few points . The film takes place in the not too distant future where organ failure becomes an epidemic . A company -LRB- Geneco -RRB- sells organs and surgical procedures with a payment plan . If you ca n't make the payment , the Repo Man comes to take your organs back ! Yea , awesome right ?! I would say this movie is more like a mix of SAW and Phantom of the Opera , with a kick of humor which was totally unexpected . There were times where you would be rocking out to the catchy music , closing your eyes from the gory scenes , or laughing your ass off ! Remember that rap loving friend ? She loved it too ! Although I enjoyed ALL the music and acting in the movie , I was particularly impressed with Sarah Brightman who portrayed the character `` Blind Mag '' , an opera singer with genetically implanted eyes . The woman can act , sing and captivate an audience . The cast also included Paris Hilton , Paul Sorvino , Bill Moseley , and Alexa Vega to name a few . If you are debating over whether or not you should see it , SEE IT . If you are debating over whether or not you should buy it , BUY IT . Let 's just say I 'm not so sure Titanic is my favorite movie anymore . Sahand Miraminy " ,10
" Groomed to be a Cult Classic ? . I know a few people that absolutely love this movie . One friend had just bought a copy of it , so I bought it from him . Big mistake . I like movies from many genres , I like the Saw Series , -LRB- although Saw II was a letdown -RRB- . The movie I watched directly before this -LRB- might have been a bad choice to have watched them back-to-back -RRB- was another musical , High Society -LRB- 1956 -RRB- scored by Cole Porter . Trying to compare Repo to a Cole Porter Musical is like trying to compare apples to Volkswagens . Repo is a bad rip-off of Rocky Horror Picture Show -LRB- 1975 -RRB- . The storyline is different , but the background score and lyrics are reminiscent of Richard O'Brien 's , closer to his second movie , Shock Treatment , but nowhere near as clever or catchy . The costuming is actually similar to Shock Treatment too . The graverobber fits the role of the Criminologist -LRB- Charles Gray -RRB- in Rocky Horror perfectly . Both narrating the movie in a fashion . The movie nudges Rocky Horror a little too much . The score makes me , as another reviewer commented , made me cringe . Bousman likes his quirky opera , its a personal project , based on the interviews on the DVD , but its not fit for anything other than a recycling container . The people who made this movie thought they could improve Rocky Horror or pay homage to it . Either way , no soap . I love Paul Sorvino -LRB- Rotti Largo -RRB- , I do n't hate Paris Hilton -LRB- Amber Sweet -RRB- as much as other people seem to , and I even have a regard for Bill Moseley -LRB- Luigi Largo -RRB- from his other roles , notably House of 1000 Corpses -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , Halloween -LRB- 2007 -RRB- and the Alphabet Killer -LRB- 2008 -RRB- . The characters and their roles are augmented by a cartoon\/comic book background , similar to A Scanner Darkly -LRB- 2005 -RRB- or Creepshow -LRB- 1982 -RRB- , but I felt the whole mechanism fails badly . The characters and the acting hobble around without any guidance or point . I should add I was amazed at Sorvino 's singing ability at this point . Did n't help though . A few thoughts\/reactions to the movie from our watching of it : We 're watching Repo , laughing at it , making fun of it , ridiculing it . We 're not laughing with it , we 're laughing at it though . It has a quality that does n't allow me to turn it off and throw the DVD across the room , but that does n't really make up for the lack of what makes movies good . Sorry . The complete absence of what makes movies good . I like movies that are campy and ones that are classy , and this movie is n't either . I like Hershel Gordon Lewis ' work . All of it . I like Dario Argento and Giallo . I love Sci-Fi , I love horror movies , especially zombie movies . I even like some of Troma 's offerings of movies -LRB- The Last Horror Film -LRB- 1985 -RRB- Especially -RRB- . Alexa Vega 's singing is awful . Really awful . The movie has a nails on the chalkboard quality to it . Screechy . The scene with Paris Hilton on the Genetic Opera almost got me to break the DVD . Almost . Making farting noises for 98 minutes would be about a wash in terms of enjoyment factor . It has an unfortunate comic quality to it ... similar to a clown being run over by a balloon truck . Terrible . " ,1
" Sliced Bread , move over ! . The populace has been waiting for a cult movie like this since RHPS . It was exquisitely imagined realized . The creative director and team really went above and beyond for this film . Despite the fantastical nature of any musical , this one really sold me . And the performances of all the major cast members were quite simply perfect . Anthony Stewart Head , Alexa Vega , Terrance Zdunich , Sarah Brightman , even Paris Hilton ! Just fantastic ! The only performances I have any beef with are the two brothers . I felt their performances were n't nearly as solid as the rest . I wish I could go and watch it again and again , but it was only showing for one night near me . So , unless it is released to general theaters I 'll have to wait for the DVD . Which I will watch over and over again ! If this is anywhere near you , and you like alternative culture , musicals , or independent movies , go see this ! FANTASTIC !! I ca n't say it enough ! " ,9
" Excellent and Unique Experience . I just got back from seeing an advanced screening of this film , and have to say that it was one of the most original pieces of film and music\/opera that I have ever experienced . I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout most of the running time ! The movie featured truly excellent performances by virtually the entire cast -LRB- even Paris Hilton , to my own amazement -RRB- , but as far as I 'm concerned no performance was as incredible as that of Anthony Stewart Head , who truly stole the show -LRB- which , in this movie , was a difficult and remarkable feat -RRB- . The music was absolutely incredible -- an incredible display of the very best that Gothic rock music has to offer . Although I could have used a little more continuity in musical thematic material , the only real issue I had was with the lyrics , which were very simple -LRB- particularly in comparison to the rhythmically and harmonically complex musical accompaniment -RRB- . Also , I did n't feel like the lyrics were set particularly well melodically , with a few notable exceptions . But on the whole , this lack of lyrical complexity did n't really matter -- I was n't conscious of it all that regularly . All in all , a definite recommendation for anyone into the goth-rock scene , and is n't afraid of a little gruesomeness ! " ,9
" Great Movie !!! . I just saw this movie at a free screening presented by my university 's program board and since I am a total nerd , I already knew some of the songs and was one of the people whom Darren -LRB- yes , he was there -RRB- encouraged to sing as loud as possible along with the characters in the film . Right from the beginning , you can tell that this is not going to be like any other movie that you 've seen before . As Darren said during his Q A session after the screening , this was more of a passion project for him as he is trying to do things outside of the horror genre now . The point was to make a weird movie with a `` wtf ? '' cast , which is exactly what I feel has been accomplished here . Due to the lack of a marketing budget , it is up to the fans to spread the word , which is exactly what we were all told to do : talk about the movie , whether you liked it or absolutely hated it , as long as word about it got around . I was even the only one fortunate enough to get a personalized message on my poster when Darren signed it , `` go on IMDb ! '' Look what I did . I 'm finally actually putting my account on here to good use . It 's so worth it . =] " ,10
" This movie is Sushi . I just got out of a screening of this film with Darren Bousman , Darren Smith , Terrance Zdunich , and Jason Constantine . And I fully agree with a comment Mr. Bousman made about this film ; This movie is like sushi . If you go to a steakhouse , you expect to get porterhouse . You would be completely shocked if your waiter brought you sushi . You may like sushi or hate it , but it 's completely the opposite of what you expected . That 's how this movie is - nothing like what I expected . It combines comic book narratives with live action with opera in a post-apocalyptic world . It is about 98 % sung , and all completely by the people who play the characters . I was completely shocked by the talent displayed by everyone , especially Paris Hilton . Terrance Zdunich , one of the creators , is to be commended especially in his role as the Graverobber - he steals the movie . REPO ! is incredibly stylized - it has elements of Blade Runner , Rocky Horror , Alice in Wonderland , Shakespearian drama , Italian opera , and , strangely , Lloyd-Webber musicals . It is definitely not to be taken too seriously - some of the songs are hilarious , and if you do n't understand that they are supposed to be ridiculous and funny , you may end up hating the move . That being said , this is a movie that is for a specific audience - not for everyone by any standards . As I said before , everyone performs incredibly well , from Alexa Vega -LRB- who knew she could sing so well ? -RRB- to Anthony Stewart Head -LRB- a gem -RRB- to Ogre . Especially Anthony Head - his voice suits the duality of his role as the Repo Man\/Nathan perfectly , and he really gets into both sides of the character 's psyche . I was completely blown away by REPO ! Whether you love or hate the movie , you can not deny that it is the most original film you have ever seen . " ,8
" REPO ! is amazing . Horror industry goes under the knife . The Genetic Opera repossesses originality , leaves fan addicted The scene in the Alamo Draft House could rival 6th Street on Halloween . Fans from all over country had flooded into Austin for the US premiere of Repo ! The Genetic Opera . The bulk of the crowd , myself included , looked like a cross between a hospital morgue and The Rocky Horror Picture Show , sporting corsets , surgery scars and other outfits based on characters of Repo ! . From director Darren Lynn Bousman -LRB- Saw 2 , 3 , 4 -RRB- , Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a full-length rock opera\/horror movie , taking the concept of musically tuned murder and pushing it to unseen extremes . What sets Repo ! apart from movies such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show , is Repo ! 's lack of spoken dialogue . Unlike a musical , the film 's dialogue is completely sung , start to finish , and tracked to original instrumental scores . The hoard in the Draft House lobby remained relatively calm , until I could n't help but scream out `` Zydrate comes in a little glass vial ! '' As if on queue , half the crowd returned with the call `` a little glass vial !? '' The crowded lobby echoed as the fans continued to call out lines from one of Repo ! 's best known songs , `` Zydrate Anatomy . '' The pre-screening shenanigans was all to the amusement the director Darren Lynn Bousman , actor\/co-writer\/illustrator Terrance Zdunich and music composure Joseph Bishara , who were in attendance for the premiere . After the fans were shuffled into the theater , the manager at Alamo warned the audience anyone who talks will be forcefully removed , to which Bousman announced it retort anyone who knows that songs must `` sing with it ! '' In the time of Repo ! , the world has been plagued by organ failures ; millions died . Finally , a cure was discovered : organ replacement . Rotti Largo founded GeneCo , a company that manufactured genetically superior organs , and saved humanity . GeneCo ruled the economy , marketing fashionable organs , designer surgeries and the highly addictive , glowing painkiller , Zydrate . Organ replacements and surgery are not cheap , either . Those who could not afford their treatment were given the option to finance their organs , though all organs are subject to legal defaults . Anyone who goes 90-days-delinquent on their organs payments is hunted by GeneCo 's Repo Men . The best of these Repo men , Nathan Wallace must hide his secretive life from his daughter , Shilo , who has lived her life confined to her room because of a blood disease . But when Shilo ventures outside her room , she lands in the middle of GeneCo 's twisted stage event , The Genetic Opera , and learns Rotti may have her cure . With the guidance of Blind Mag and Graverobber , Shilo braves the horrific world she 's watched for years from her window . The idea of a horror opera may seem awkward , but the film flowed amazingly well . The mood of each scene was reflected by in instrumental music , and the vocals augmented the character 's emotions . Overall the audio gave a seldom seen compliment to the film 's visuals . The entire experience of the film was more like a concert than a movie screening . Within the first few minutes of the film , every person in the audience got into the groove of the music . Breaking into song repeatedly , nearly the entire audience sang at the top of their lungs with the songs released in weeks prior to the screening . Torrents of cheers and applause followed all twenty of the major numbers . The film 's soundtrack , released digitally Sept. 30th , includes 22 songs from the film . How well this album sells weighs heavily on if Repo ! will get a wide release . Please , please , please go to REPO-OPERA . COM , REPOROADTOUR.COM and NOTYOURPARENTSOPERA.COM if you have any interest in this film , it sinks or swims by fan reactions ! - Rachel S. " ,10
" 21st Century Rocky Horror . I laughed , I cried , I nearly threw up ;-RRB- Repo is the movie I 've been waiting my entire life for . I too saw this at the Fantastic Fest , I was lucky enough to view it twice . Darren Bousman and Terrance Zdunich were there also , hanging out w \/ the fans , making it even more of a memorable experience . Gorgeous film , amazing from start to finish . Perfect cast\/songs\/costumes , everything . You can really see the love and hard work put into this film . You need to see this at the theater to truly appreciate it - please , fill the seats when it opens in Ny\/La\/Vegas , try to get it as the national release it deserves . The soundtrack comes out 9\/30 -LRB- www.notyourparentsopera.com and\/or www.amazon.com -RRB- - once you hear these songs you wo n't be able to get them out of your head . See Repo , there 's nothing else like it and probably will never be . TESTIFY ! " ,10
" Unlike anything you 've ever seen ... . First off , Bousman has said numerous times he set out to make a movie like no one has ever seen before - and he delivers . With a vengeance . From start to finish , Repo creates a stunning world that is a little bit more eccentric ; other reviews have invoked Blade Runner , Nightmare Before Christmas , Rocky Horror and a slew of other movies when trying to describe but nothing can really come close . It brings together actors from all scores : from gangster movies to Joss Whedon ventures , to Broadway divas ; some of the names include Paul Sorvino , Anthony Stewart Head , Paris Hilton and Alexa Vega . The movie portrays a dystopic world where organ failures have become so wide spread that their transplants have become financed like cars and houses and just like cars or houses , failure to keep up with your payments can result in repossession . The dirty work is done by hooded and feared Repo Men , at the beck and call of the organ-lending house and world power GeneCo led by the sinister Rotti Largo , played masterfully by Paul Sorvino . Largo is dying and while his children bicker among themselves as to who will follow father to the GeneCo throne : Largo concentrates his efforts on settling a few old scores . On the other end of the spectrum is the Repo Man Nathan Wallace -LRB- a morose and at the same time vile Head who is clearly enjoying his role -RRB- who tries to shield his daughter from the world of GeneCo , Graverobbers , and the same fatal disease that took his wife and her mother 17 years prior . Spirited Shilo -LRB- Vega -RRB- , in true teen heroine fashion will have none of it and is determined to see what the world has to offer . The movie is many things ; being able to be both humorous albeit in a macabre Gothic fashion that Burton wishes he could accomplish and terrifying - the Repo Man relishes his job and often wastes no time in dispatching his targets . There are as well scenes of intense and genuine emotion ; some of which come somewhat surprisingly in cartoon feed-ins that a whole new level to the movie and help move the story along . This is what Sweeny Todd wishes it could be . The movie does have some faults : the small budget can be seen occasionally , and there are moments you can tell scenes were cut due to time constraints . But they are forgotten quickly when faced with the sheer ingenuity and talent displayed both in front of and behind the camera . The actors are enjoying themselves , the music is f \* cking amazing , and the sheer visual experience from costumes to the animation makes you wanting more . Bottom line : you need to experience this movie . It is not something seen - and sadly if the studio has it 's way - it wo n't be . Write Lionsgate , your local theaters , your blogs , your congressman ANYONE you can think of to demand this movie get a wider release . Find this movie at showings and film festivals . See it . Demand it . It deserves to be seen on the big screen in all its glory . You wo n't regret it . " ,9
" One of the best movies I have ever seen . . The title says it all . I was able to see this film through an advance screening at my school , and let me just say , this movie is not just a movie -- it is an EVENT . Every actor brought something different to the mix and played their part above and beyond any of my expectations -LRB- even Paris Hilton ! -RRB- . Anthony Stewart Head -LRB- Nathan\/Repo Man -RRB- and Alexa Vega -LRB- Shilo -RRB- are incredible as the lead characters . Head brilliantly captured a man with a tortured soul and mental issues ; the complex dual-personality he portrays is always spot-on and never overdone . Vega 's Shilo is one of subtle brilliance , as we watch her character mature from an somewhat weak , naive girl , into a strong , independent young woman . Of course , it goes without saying that Sarah Brightman -LRB- Blind Mag -RRB- was simply phenomenal in this film . Her songs in particular were some of the best parts of the movie , especially `` Chromaggia . '' Paul Sorvino , Bill Moseley , Paris Hilton , and Nivek Ogre were rightfully cast as the dysfunctional Largo family . Sorvino 's voice is just what the film calls for , and Moseley , Hilton , and Ogre all bring out their best in their characters , making them all likable . Terrance Zdunich as the Graverobber is a delight to see and hear on screen . The music , sets , lyrics , costumes -- everything about this movie was simply incredible . It was fast-paced , but not rushed , and the songs could n't have been done better . The amount of emotion in this film is almost unbelievable -- by the end I had been reduced to tears . This is definitely a must-see film ; you will most certainly not regret it . " ,10
" It 's The 21st Century Cure . To start off , Repo ! The Genetic Opera is not just a film , it is an experience . From start to finish Repo ! Gives your brain a sharp jolt and sends you on a ride you will never forget . This will be a spoiler free review so do not fear . Last night I had the opportunity to sit in on a film festival screening of Repo ! The Genetic Opera , the new film directed by Darren Lyn Bousman -LRB- Saw 2,3 , and 4 -RRB- and based on the stage play written by Terrance Zdunich and Darren Smith . I was able to see Repo ! not just once but two times in a row . As we entered the theater , women dressed as Genterns -LRB- the nurses in the world of Repo ! -RRB- greeted guest with playbills advertising the Genetic Opera -LRB- an event commonly held for entertainment -RRB- and Bling Mag 's -LRB- Sarah Brightman -RRB- farewell performance . Inside the playbill were 20 of the films principal numbers . Once inside and seated we were served glowing blue Zydrate -LRB- a very powerful pain killer that the characters are addicted to -RRB- Champagne . If that alone is n't cool I do not know what is . Once the film started a sense of awe filled my body . Every aspect of this film truly is a labor of love , and every single actor pulls his and her own weight , including Miss Paris Hilton who does a wonderful job singing and acting . Each performance was solid and unique making these characters very three dimensional . The visuals were quite possibly one of the best parts of this film . From the gritty to the pretty , Repo ! is filled with beautiful environments and stunning costumes . The writing is solid and delivers some good laughs as well has some great thrills . At the heart of Repo ! is the soundtrack . The music is original and catchy and every number is different and spans the wide ranges of rock music . Yes , Repo ! is a rock opera , the film is told all through song with very little dialogue in between big numbers . Each song has its own strengths and if you listen to closely , each number has a key instrument , and that instrument propels the number forward . Of course this review would not be complete with out talking about Mr. Darren Lyn Bousman 's directing . Mr. Bousman , who has inspired me since Saw 2 , has truly grown immensely in his talent and captured this story in the best way possible . No one other than Bousman could have done what he did and the way he did it . Bousman will be remembered as one of the most innovated and talented directors of our generation for this movie alone . However , my one and only complain of Repo ! Is that the film felt a little short after its stunning climax . This movie will leave you wanting A LOT more . However , I do not blame Bousman or Zdunich for this VERY minor complaint . Bousman and Zdunich stated that there is 45 minutes of music and footage that was left out of the film for money reasons alone , if they had had a better budget those 45 minutes would still be in the film . Some songs might be a little to short and at a few points in the film you could notice were some of the story and numbers would have been . Like I said though , these complaints did not bother me because of the justification . Bousman and crew did a great job slimming the story down with out leaving any plot holes , I just wish we could have seen the full product . All in all Repo ! Will blow your mind , leave you in awe , make you want more , and even in come cases cry -LRB- yes I did cry -RRB- . With great chills , thrills , and spills , Repo ! Is a one of a kind movie experience anyone and everyone should be able to experience . However , lions gate films is sadly giving this remarkable film a limited release of 10 screens . It up to us to show lionsgate that we do want a love Repo ! Please go to www.repo-opera.com , view the trailer and join the message boards and the community of people fighting for Repo ! Repo ! The Genetic Opera is set for a November 7 release . Soundtrack will be available for download September 30 at www.notyourparentsopera.com " ,10
" This WILL be the next major cult classic in the history of cinema . I was one of the many fortunate souls to catch a screening of `` Repo ! '' at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival . The energy in the cinema was high as we all waited to catch a first glimpse of this film . For well over year , I have been watching the progress of this film as it headed towards an unknown release date . I can recall seeing the first teaser trailer that premiered at the 2007 Scream Awards . From that point on I was already sold on what would surely become a cult classic . Alas , release dates would pass by and there would be no Repo in the cinemas . A few reviews popped up here and there from special critic screenings which kept my anticipation in the clouds . Then this past August there was the announcement that Repo ! would be playing at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival . Now I told you that story to lead you into this part of the story . As you can tell , I was extremely hyped to see this movie at the festival . And generally when I am this hyped for a movie I almost always seem to walk away disappointed in some form or fashion . The lights finally dimmed , a few trailers played here and there ... and then the movie started . A year of waiting , watching trailers , reading early reviews , and here it was finally playing before my eyes ... I did not walk away disappointed , at all . I 'm very diverse when it comes to my love of cinema , I am fan of several hundred different movies coming from all walks of life . So this review is not coming from someone whose sole focus is on just watching horror films . Repo ! The Genetic Opera will be a cult classic that will last for years . If it does n't end up becoming the next `` Rocky Horror Picture Show '' I will be very disappointed . The acting was very impressive given the subject matter at hand . Not only that , but 95 % of the movie is singing , so the acting had to be conveyed through lyrics and emotion in the songs . Anthony Stewart Head has such a wide range of emotion in his voice when he sings that its hard to believe that he is n't a heavy metal singer . One player in particular deserves special mention , Terrance Zdunich as the Grave Robber -LRB- also co-creator and writer -RRB- . Why have n't we seen this guy before ? The man is extremely talented -LRB- granted he should have the role down pat after playing it for nearly a decade -RRB- . Darren Lynn Bousman also deserves a standing ovation for breaking away from the beloved Saw franchise to direct this . He showed amicable talent in the Saw films , but here he really shined . There was no frantic shaky camera work , every shot was well orchestrated and composed . This was directed by somebody who had a deep passion for the material at hand . It 's unfortunate that this movie is not getting a wider release . Terrance Zdunich -LRB- during a special Q A -RRB- said that a majority of the success this movie has in the long run depends on the fans . Too be fair , on paper I could see why this film would be a bit of gamble for a movie studio . It 's definitely a movie that needs to be seen as a visual experience . However , after seeing the finished product , it 's unfortunate that Lions Gate is n't doing more to promote this film . So I can only hope and pray that this movie finds its massive audience and attention it deserves in the long run . " ,10
" Repo ! The Genetic Opera . Was asked to go with a group of people to support a showing here in Austin . I saw the trailer and thought `` OK , I 'll try it . '' I normally would never go to something like this . Within the first 5 minutes I was completely wrong , blown away and precariously perched on the edge of my seat waiting for the next tasty morsel . I never would have thought this would work if I had read about it first . This is no `` Tommy '' nor is it another `` Rocky Horror '' . This movie has the most ingenious combination of the most incredible actors , songs and story . Paul Sorvino is ever the consummate villain . Sarah Brightman is brilliant . Terrance Zdunich is just the right combination of smart ass and narrator . Alexa Vega has grown into a fantastic actress . What more could be said for the Jekyll and Hyde character of Anthony Head . Simply amazing . Paris Hilton made my jaw drop . She was spot on ! I have never seen something so rich , horrific -LRB- I 'm a wuss -RRB- and stunning in theater today . I am praying to every deity I can think of to help get a wide release date so I can go again -LRB- and again -RRB- . Like most other fans , I am sure , there simply are not enough adjectives in the lexicon to describe how much I enjoyed this . I have seen it 3 times already . The 3rd time even sinking to bribery and the possible sacrifice of my daughter to get in again . If you are fortunate to live in LA , LV , NY or SF do yourself a favor and take in the experience . You will not be disappointed . I would recommend learning the key songs from the website however . The entire theater will sing along with all of them loudly and proudly ! PS . No children were harmed or sacrificed in the writing of this review . " ,10
" If the people behind Hannah Montanna did a gore-hound flick . . First , I feel I must clarify something . Putting blood and guts and goth girls in a movie does not make it edgy , a cult classic , or provocative . It also needs to have acting , good songs if it is a musical , and an interesting story . I have not found a movie I have disliked watching more than this in a long time . As my title says , I felt like I was watching some Disney , Jonas bros kind of crap . But whereas Disney channel stories cater to Hollister type crowds , this is for the trendy , just as spoiled teenagers at Hot Topic . To me there was no difference , it was just blood and guts instead of haircuts and glitter . The lyrics and songs were terrible . The song infected was pointedly bad , and I cringed through most of her whiny teenager performance . I 'm infected ... with your GENETICS . I believe there was some sort of line like damn these GENETICS ! that made me want to vomit . The grave robber was some over-made up guy with this brooding I 'm an attractive , brooding trendy goth guy in a music video attitude . I think he 's supposed to come across as deep , mysterious and bad ass , but he just comes across as more of a self-centered , shallow fashion model then Paris Hilton does . At one point , in a perfect like srsly omigos u guiz lololol styled line , she spouts why , cuz i 'm seventeen , well , it 's better than forty ! which then cuts to a horrific rock and roll sugar-coated spoiled brat anthem . Every teenybopper who chose hot topic over ambercrombie was probably rocking out . Ya , my dad is so lame , he makes me take out the trash it 's no fair , i 'll show him what a bad ass rebel I am ! This one scene , this Joan Jett-respect killing scene , was more painful that any scene I have ever seen in any movie . Ever . The whole movie was filled with horrible lines that I could go on and on about . Bottom line is this , this movie made me cringe in it 's horribleness . Omigosh , guts and singing at the same time ? Yes , trendy teenagers go see it and pretend it 's ground breaking , and pretend it 's a cult classic , but it 's not . I love gore movies , I love horror movies , and any self respecting gore hound or true hardcore horror fan will stay away from Repo , forever . " ,1
" Why the ladies seem to like this one ... . ... is beyond me , unless they all happen to be goth geekettes with a predilection for leather outfits , dark lipstick , blue-tinted , dingy sets , droning faux-opera-metal-punk-noise music , and copious amounts of stage blood and squirming innards for shock value . All I can say is it 's a good thing I found this at the library , because it 's little more than an example of Murphy 's Law and Sturgeon 's Revelation all rolled into one . In a word : lame . Which is a shame , because the concept of the piece , bodysharking -LRB- cf. Judge Dredd comics -RRB- , has promise , but the execution left much to be desired . Do n't fool yourself ; whenever a film bills itself as a cult classic , it usually is n't . Almost everything about Repo ! The Genetic Opera screams , Pretentious ! The songwriting is atonal , unmelodious and unmemorable , the lyrics banal with nary a rhyme within earshot , the acting derivative and stagy , and the construction of the piece seems to have been done with the guiding precept of , Throw everything you can think of at the screen and see what sticks . Unfortunately , very little does . I 'd have to categorize this one as a vanity project , and unlike some vanity projects , what seems to be missing most is a sense of fun . Repo ! ... feels more like a Frankenstein 's monster pastiche of other far more successful musicals like The Phantom of the Opera , Rocky Horror Picture Show , Sweeney Todd ... , and the like , and a bad pastiche at that . The characters are all unlikeable , the music off-putting , the production and art design purposefully dark and oppressive ; the entire affair reeks of performance art snobbery and sado-masochistic self-indulgence . In another word : garbage . It tries way too hard , and succeeds in just falling on its face . How talents like Paul Goodfellas Sorvino and Sarah Aspects of Love Brightman got roped into this project is a mystery . Paris Hilton I can understand . Some of the others I can understand ; a paycheck is a paycheck after all . The current 32 % 10 rating here on the IMDb is risible at best ; I have n't seen such a clear indication of shill voting in a while . Repo ! ... gets a 4 from me strictly for production value extracted from a low budget ; there 's little else to recommend . I suppose Skinny Puppy fans might be pleased , or Joan Jett completists , or even Saw geeks . I 'm not at all surprised that this one tanked theatrically ; if ever a film deserved to flop , this is one of them . Sorry , guys , but it 's back to the drawing boards with you . Director Darren Lynn Saw II-IV Bousman may be a master of torture porn , but he simply has n't the chops for a musical , let alone one with such mediocre tunes and forgettable characters . Someone should have sent the repo man after this one . " ,4
" I know people like to latch on to stuff like this but seriously ... . When i heard about this movie ill admit i was pretty interested , the story sounded interesting , it was a musical , but really the only reason i wanted to see it was because Anthony Stewart Head was in it . Im a HUGE Buffy fan . But god was this movie terrible . The writing is terrible , the acting in some parts is just embarrassing -LRB- I was cringing during Alexa Vega 's little rock bit -RRB- . The most interesting character , the graverobber , has the smallest part . They took a really great concept and a great cast -LRB- with some exceptions -RRB- and killed it with terrible writing . Really most of the songs are terrible , the few that are passable are too short and the really terrible ones seem to drag on and on . Some people may find this movie entertaining simply because of the gore but the ridiculous story just makes it unbearable . Sure its different and creative but that does n't make a good movie . Skip it . Save yourself lots of cringing and wtf 's . " ,2
" No spectators with Repo . A film that 's lived as much as it is watched - in its purest sense , that 's the Repo experience . For anyone following the movie , you 'll know well the difficulty its creators -LRB- Darren Bousman , Darren Smith Terrance Zdunich -RRB- have had in getting a release . And for the audience , we go through the same struggle they do . Watching Repo is n't as simple as strolling down to your local theater and buying your ticket . Short of a few select cities , Repo appears only in festivals or via a ` Road Show ' tour with the creators themselves . That sort of exclusivity makes devotees out of otherwise eager fans , for to see Repo , you must seek Repo . Like many , I obsessively tracked Repo online , watching the exclusive website featurettes and buying its soundtrack on iTunes . By the time my chance to see the movie finally arrived , I was already in love . For me to not enjoy this film , beavers would 've had to have killed the main actors and replace them for the final act . So yeah , I 'm biased . But if you 're reading this , you probably are , too . If you have the opportunity to see Repo in a theater , do n't hesitate . Take it . Alone , with friends , with a group of strangers you met in line , just see Repo in a theater . And watch out for the beavers . " ,10
" Of course mainstream critics could n't enjoy a film like this . . It 's too WEIRD . Too disturbing , and even awkward at times . But that 's what makes it such a unique experience . Am I allowed to say that this film exceeded my expectations , without sounding clich ? It exceeded them , and embellished them . It stroked my expectations . It took my expectations and ran with them through the rain , dancing in puddles on the tar . It laid them out on red silk sheets with Rachmaninov playing in accompaniment . Every time I read a bad review I have to laugh . These are crotchety old critics trying to come up with something award-worthy , and in doing so , they are completely missing the point . REPO is hilarious , gut-wrenching , sexy , horrifying , fascinating , and completely original . It is not Casablanca or Titanic . It is a futuristic rock opera about organ failure . It is also moving and beautiful in ways that traditional dramas could never be . And the characters - how to describe ? A multi-personalitied organ repossession man , his frail and earnest daughter , an opera singer with digital-video implanted eyeballs , a graverobber who draws a narcotic from corpse heads , a sex-obsessed narcissist who wears female faces for fun ... you ca n't find this stuff at your local multiplex . It 's too edgy . It 's edgy to the point of nearly falling off - but it does n't . I managed to snag at least ten of my friends for the 7:30 showing , and none were disappointed . ` Absolutely amazing . ' ` The most fun I 've had at a movie in ages . ' ` So , so good . ' ` Wow . Just wow . ' After the film I could n't resist shaking hands with Darren Bousman and telling him he 'd made one of the best films I 'd ever seen . " ,10
" Epitome of spectacle . Bodacious and bombastic , `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' is a fine testament to the grit and gusto of modern filmmakers . It shows none of it 's low-budget , looking as lavish as any current film can . Each performance is worthy of praise , and each character is played to a T. It 's gripping up through the end , and flows smoother than hot butter . If you like using your eyes or ears , then watch this film . It deserves far better than direct-to-DVD . Call your local theater , and get this film taken up . I love it , and you can to . I caught an advanced screening , and I 'm already lined up to buy another ticket . It 's everything a rock concert tries to be . " ,9
" Well worth the travel time ! . I was lucky enough to see the first show in Toronto this past weekend , and I have to say that the drive was well worth it ! I originally found the movie on one of the gossip websites that I frequent , which had posted a video of Paris Hilton in her latest acting performance . After watching that , I did some research , and was instantly intrigued . The movie was excellent ! Going in to it , I knew that it was likely to be gory and filled with carnage , since it is made by the guy that does Saw . But it was n't actually so bad -LRB- considering that I ca n't stand Saw , I did n't have much of a problem with it -RRB- . The music was so amazing !! I have to say that I already knew that Anthony Head could sing -LRB- from Buffy -RRB- , as well as Sarah Brightman -LRB- that was obvious -RRB- , but I was VERY impressed by both Paris Hilton and Paul Sorvino ! Sorvino sang like a true opera star ! I have to admit that I 've never seen him in any other movies , but wow can this guy sing ! He did an excellent job ! As for Paris , I know that she can sing from her brief musical career . I know that some people said she sucked ; guess what , she was SUPPOSED to sound like anything but a fantastic opera singer like the character wanted ... that 's the funny\/ironic part of it ! But the parts that Paris sang were very well done -LRB- Zydrate Ananomy ? SO GOOD ! -RRB- Characters were all done very well . Alex Vega has certainly grown up since the last movie I saw her in -LRB- Sleepover or something ... \* shudders \* -RRB- and she has a lovely voice as well . The three Largo siblings were HILARIOUS ! The two brothers were so funny , and yet at the same time , so scary ! I mean , Pavi was CREEPY as hell !! But some of the things he said were hilarious ! -LRB- The end credits ... BAHAHAH ! -RRB- Nathan Wallace\/The Repo man was a really complex character ! I mean , one minute he 's this caring father , and the next he 's pulling the entrails out of someone ! And the twist at the end shines another light on his personality . Anthony Head did a very good job portraying him , and I have to say that I wish he was in more movies :-LRB- A couple complaints that I do have are as followed : I found that the plot went by VERY quickly . Like BANG this happens , the BANG this happens . There was n't a lot of explanation in between events , and not that it was hard to follow , but I personally like a lot of detail . My other complaint was WHERE WAS GRAVE-ROBBER !? He was one of the reason 's I wanted to see the movie !! Terrance is just so sexy in the part , and I was really looking forward to seeing lots of him ... but he was only in like 4 scenes !! Right now , I 'm hoping for some extras on the DVD or something . The movie was well worth the drive and wait , as I said already . It for sure has a ` clut movie ' feel to it , but at the same time I do n't feel that it can be compared to Rocky Horror -LRB- for one thing , it 's filmed a lot better , and I find that it does n't really impose on itself like Rocky Horror does -RRB- It 's for sure a movie that can be seen as a cult film , since it is after all only being released as of right now in select cities . BUT the composer was at the movie on Saturday -LRB- it was a film festival -RRB- , and he said that they were going to try and open up some other cities across the country -LRB- I 'm assuming both United States and Canada -RRB- because the devoted fan following is proof that people do and will go see it !! Great movie with fantastic music and character 's attached to it !! I would say a must see if you 're interested in the comic-book or cult movie scene !! " ,9
" Bad in every aspect ! . I felt compelled to write a review after seeing some of the comments here that have prematurely anointed this movie a classic . Since a few filmmakers out there abuse this site to generate more positive spin on what is otherwise horrible work , I feel it is important to comment . As for this film , if you can call it that . . I am quite sure it will end up in the top 10 list of worst movies of 2008 for many critics -LRB- in fact it already has for a few -RRB- . I had the strange coincidence of viewing this the day after watching the musical Rent with a few friends . The first thing I notice in this film was just how poorly written and constructed it is for a musical , this is something done by high school drama clubs . Now it is not a rule that every word in a musical needs to be sung . You can have people actually talking from time to time . But , if the decision is to have no spoken words , then you best be able to construct a flow of the songs to create a story . Jesus Christ Superstar is a perfect example of a musical with NO spoken words done right . In fact in my opinion it is close to perfection how the songs came together to form a story . This is not easy , each song must not only contribute to the moment , but more importantly must fit properly into the flow of the musical . This movie on the other hand seems like merely a collection of songs thrown together and patched to form a complete movie . As for the music , I was even less impressed . Best way I can describe it is music written by people who have no respect , interest , or preference to this type of music . It came off very much like in a network TV show they have in the script for a Heavy Metal band to play , so they hire some guys who have no clue how to write hard rock , and simply have them wear some wigs . In other words it was like having Hall and Oates write and perform Iron Maiden-esquire music . Sure some songs could be written , but listening to them would torture . I do have to add that the greatest irony of this movie was that Paris Hilton of all things was actually not that bad . In fact I could have had more Hilton and less Paul Sorvino who was poorly cast for this role . She definitely does NOT have a voice to become a professional singer , but there is talent there enough that she could easily do other musicals . But , I guess you could take this as a sign of this movie that Paris Hilton is the highlight ! Uggh . From what I read there is a plan two more in the series . My advice if they desire to gain any respect or positive reviews would be to hire professional Broadway writers and musicians to come in and at the very least polish and plug the holes . This movie did have potential , and I must say I was eagerly waiting for it 's release . But in the end the execution was so miserable this will certainly be in the top 3 of worst movies of 2008 for me . " ,3
" What the heck is this ? . Well , I have to say I only skimmed this thing . Is it a movie ? I do n't think so . It 's more like silly horror theater . Once the initial faux cartoon intro was over and the prose began , I quickly felt sorry for the actors . I literally squirmed in my seat . Adults participated in this ? Adults ? I 'm serious . I really felt bad for the poor saps who had the singing\/poetry parts . I really just could n't bring myself to watch much of it . And not because of gore or horror ! But because of shame and embarrassment . There has never been a moment in my life when I did n't know about the major schisms between my fellow members of the human race . Obviously I 've just been reintroduced to one of those schisms . The fact that people find enjoyment and entertainment in this ... and adults at that ! Well , one good thing about it is that I will never find myself among such people . Creepy , gross and embarrassing lot . Hey , I ai n't knocking horror films . Most of us enjoy a bit of horror now and again . But the mix of weirdness , horror , singing , Goth make-up , death , prose , medical fascism , etc. . . this ai n't horror . It 's something else . Obviously I do n't know what it is , I 'm not in that bag . I 'm glad I was able to scan through it and quickly get rid of it , never ever never to ever witness it ever again . Truly , I 'm sorry for the people who participated in this film . Honest , I am . Yet , there are extremely high reviews for this . Maybe you 're one of those and you 'll cream over this . Please steer clear of my house , thank you very much . " ,1
" It cold have been sooooooo good . When I heard that the creative team behind SAW was creating a musical I was skeptical , but also intrigued . I ended up seeing REPO ! The Genetic Opera and turns out that all of my fears were completely justified . That being said , I believe that the basic story of the organ repossession is a brilliant concept , and I loved how the back stories to the characters were all explained like a comic book strip , however , the rest of the movie lets down the good parts . THE CAST : there are a few exceptions to this , such as Anthony Head , who I loved in the Buffy series , his voice was good . Also Alexa Vega also showed promise with her voice , although most of the time their voices were not utilized to their full potential . Also Sarah Brightman , a very talented singer , but again not used very well . Then there is quite possibly the biggest mistake a film maker can make , putting Paris Hilton in your film . why ? THE MUSIC : A majority of the music to me was just noise , there was no catchy rhythms r anything , again there are some exceptions such as I did n't know I 'd love you so much . And Again putting Paris Hilton in ` singing ' after that album she made , one would have thought no one would ever ask her to sing again . In the end I believe that REPO ! had soooooooo much potential , which was squandered on poor choices . " ,1
" High Hopes = Bigger Fall . I was excited for this movie . I remember seeing the trailer back in November or October , and it made Repo ! look amazing . The music was catchy , the visuals stunning , the concept outlandish , and the whole thing seemed to be nothing short of visionary . I put in my pre-order for a copy of the DVD , and for months I waited with nearly-uncontainable anticipation . I passed the time reading lukewarm reviews . However , I was sure that these stuffy critics simply failed to see the brilliance of this groundbreaking musical . The final result was nothing short of disillusioning . As it turns out , the two songs from the trailer are 50 % of the good music from the entire production . Repo 's music is rather samey through the entire 97 minutes , with perhaps one or two numbers standing out . This is further aggravated by non-existent pacing , with one number spilling directly into the next . There is no build-up to any of the numbers , no moments of silence to add contrast , no clever transitions , and no pause to give the audience a rest . Instead , there is only a non-stop barrage of loud , angry sound . There are a couple of songs which -LRB- thankfully -RRB- depart from this , giving us a more subdued but intense , sultry sound . Sadly , there are too few of these to truly make for much variety . The performances themselves leave much to be desired . Props must be given to Terrance Zdunich , and Sarah Brightman shines in the few spots where she is utilized . Anthony Stewart Head is powerful and sometimes even electric , providing the only genuinely engaging moments of the musical . However , the rest of the cast is largely dismal , and the true talent often takes a backseat to lesser voices . Both Alexa Vega and Paris Hilton , have obnoxious and grating teen-sounding voices that not only lack any hint of expression , but which sound better suited to talking about boys over a cell phone than to singing music . I ca n't help but wonder if perhaps some of the other performers are perhaps more talented than they seem to be , but are handicapped by the actual parts they were given to sing . Paul Sorvino has a powerful voice and gets to show it off at the end ; for most of the musical , though , he is forced to `` sing '' short little clips of dialogue in a loud , booming tone and which ends up sounding like Broadway Tourette 's Syndrome . This brings up another major problem with Repo : characters sing when they should be talking and talk when they should be singing . Far too much dialogue is given some form of melody , even though it 's only for a sentence and does not flow into another piece . These sentences are n't even given any sort of rhythm , just notes . This sounds horrible and entirely unmusical . Meanwhile , most of the musical numbers are too short , and many of them are ruined by spoken dialogue just when they start to flow or reach a climactic moment . Perhaps one of the worst and most annoying things about Repo is that almost none of the lyrics rhyme . I do n't mean that they 're just off a little , I mean that nobody even bothered trying . Half the time , when a phrase is ending , the words not only do n't rhyme , but they have too many syllables , at which point an unnecessary measure is tacked on at the end . As a result , none of the music sounds symmetrical , or even like its phrases belong together . Also , many of the lyrics are sloppily thrown in places that cause the singer to have to emphasize the wrong syllables of a word , much like a poem written by a third-grade student . It seems as if somebody wrote a script for a play while another separate person wrote music , and the two were later crammed together without any adjustments . Other aspects of the presentation are schizophrenic in their successes . Visually , the aesthetic is fairly engaging . The costumes are neat , and some of the scene set-ups are actually pretty creative . Unfortunately , there seems to be very little change in the visual between singing and non-singing moments , giving the music very little dazzle . Perhaps an extra light or two may come on during a song , but Repo 's pieces mostly lack the visual flair that musicals are famous for showcasing . The same goes for choreography , which has a few good moments , but is mostly rather dull . Attempts at humor almost always fall flat on their face . Rotti Largo 's bodyguards -- whose robotic , men-in-black appearance seems out of place -- are about as funny as an ATM . The attempted humorous dialogue from the Largo children , which attempts to be witty and edgy , ends up being crass and annoying . Apparently , continuously yelling `` F \* ck ! '' and stabbing people is hilarious . There is one mildly funny moment in the film involving a call between Head and Vega in which both are trying to conceal their true activities , but it is barely capitalized upon . The plot is somewhat confusing , and often things seem to be thrown in out of nowhere ; the term `` red herring '' almost seems insufficient at times . Also , many of the character traits we are supposed to see , such as Luigi being angry and Pavi being popular with the girls , barely come through ; we have to take them on the film 's word . Sometimes , the plot is downright confusing , such as Rotti Largo 's plan to get revenge on the Repo Man by taking his daughter whom he loves , except that he actually wants to give her his company and kill the Repo Man , except that he never actually gives it to her , and somehow this relates to a song about gold . Overall , Repo is a film that tries to be edgy and clever but only succeeds in being gory and unprofessional -LRB- hint : see who produced it -RRB- . I , myself , am letdown by what seemed like a good idea at some point . However , no matter how good the original concept , Repo fails at almost every point of its execution . " ,2
" not your parent 's opera . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a breath of fresh air in a world of remakes , re-imaginings and sequels . I had the pleasure of seeing Repo ! at Fantastic Fest in Austin , TX on Friday . This is a movie with such a strong fan base that another sold-out show had to be added to accommodate them that day and had a total of three sold out showings at the close of the festival . Let me start by saying this : This is not your parent 's opera . It 's better than your parent 's opera . Though there are comparisons , it is also not Rocky Horror , or Jesus Christ Superstar . Having come into Repo ! long before actually being able to see the movie , I admit that I had some expectations when I walked into the theater . Not only did Repo ! meet them , it surpassed them . I was blown away by the imagery , the comic panels , the sets , costumes , the cast , everything . The cast is incredible . Yes , even Paris . Sarah Brightman could n't have picked a better movie for her first film role . Anthony Stewart Head -LRB- Giles to you Buffy fans -RRB- takes on the roles of Nathan and Repo Man and both appear effortless for him . The differences in mannerisms and voice between Nathan and Repo Man are something to see and hear . Going from quiet , loving father Nathan to the murdering Repo Man in the span of one song , `` Legal Assassin '' , Anthony Head shows us exactly why he was picked for this role . `` Thankless Job '' is more proof that ASH is Repo Man . Alexa Vega plays Shilo just as she should be : naive from being kept locked in her room her whole life . `` Infected '' and `` Genetic Emancipation '' are two of my favorite songs because of her . The three Largo children , Bill Moseley -LRB- Luigi -RRB- , Nivek Ogre -LRB- Pavi -RRB- and Paris Hilton -LRB- Amber -RRB- , in my opinion , did n't have enough screen time , but what they had was always entertaining . `` Who Ordered Pizza ? '' and `` Mark It Up '' , especially . Paul Sorvino does a great job as Rotti Largo , the dying head of GeneCo , who must decide which of his bumbling children to entrust his company to . Graverobber , played by the movie 's co-writer Terrance Zdunich , is a fun character who is a sort of Greek chorus during the film , and he sings one of the catchiest songs in the movie , `` Zydrate Anatomy '' . And I ca n't forget the Band Leader , played by the other co-writer of the movie , Darren Smith . You 'll want to `` testify '' about GeneCo yourself after seeing `` We Started This Op ` ra Sh \* t '' . I do n't want to give away too many plot points , but if you 're concerned about the presence of a certain person in this film , do n't be . Paris does a wonderful job as Amber , especially with the song `` Happiness is Not a Warm Scalpel '' . And remember , Darren initially did n't want to cast her , so something must have changed his mind . I think many people will be pleasantly surprised with Paris in this movie . She definitely won me over . So you 're sitting there reading this and you 're wondering why you should watch this movie . Watch this movie because it is one of the most original movies made in quite some time . Watch this movie because you are sick of seeing cookie-cutter movies being released every weekend . Watch this movie because you love horror movies , or musicals or horror musicals . Watch this movie for the performances . Watch it because you love Sarah Brightman , or Anthony Stewart Head , or Ogre , etc. . Watch it for the songs , because let me tell you , you will fall in love with them the first time you hear them . Watch it for the costumes . Watch it for the comic panels , created by Terrance Zdunich . Watch this movie for the directing , by Saw director Darren Lynn Bousman . Watch this movie because it will blow you away and you will want to see it again and again . I know I do . " ,9
" Worst ending ever ! . I was really liking this movie . Sure Hilton sucked , the music was lame as sh \*\* , and Joan Jet 's cameo was more creepy than anything but still , I felt like this movie could totally be my generation 's Rocky Horror Picture Show ... So I finally get to the ending ... and nothing happens . The whole movie was based around this notion that this Largo guy was gon na give his great , big , wealthy business to one of his 3 children , because apparently you cant divvy up a company in 3 ways in the future . But his kids are sh \*\*\* y and he does n't wan na give it to them . So he decides to try to give the company to his ex-girlfriend 's kid ?! But only on the condition that she kill her father . But she does n't because this movie is so f \*\* king predictable or so you think ... Then in a rapid twist of story ... Largo just flat out shoots her dad in front of her . BOOM ! nobody gets the company ... credits . All this talk about zydr8 and weird , singing , helpful grave robbers and endless possibilities for plot twists but in the ending there was nothing , no closure to any storyline or subplot . Some cool gore , like 2 good songs and ... Joan Jet , to see the f \*\* king fall of Joan Jett are the only reasons I can think of to see this movie . In other words , do n't waste your time . " ,1
" Pretty awful . I disliked the whole thing . I really enjoyed the performances by Bill Moseley , Nivek Ogre , Sarah Brightman , Paul Sorvino and Anthony Head , but that was obvious . I found the music very unpleasant . The script was so basic at times that it was n't even funny . I liked the whole organ repossession story but the dad being so disturbed by his wife 's death that he kept the daughter poisoned so she would stay with him forever was too lame . I found it to be too over the top and forced . Like it tried too hard to be dark and goth . For Evanescence fans , if you ask me . May work better as a musical on a stage instead of on a film . " ,1
" A failed attempt at `` creating '' a cult film . To call Repo ! The Genetic Opera a cross between Rocky Horror Picture Show and Saw is n't entirely accurate . While it is a rock opera like the former , and has its fair share of dismemberment and gore -LRB- courtesy of Saw IV director Darren Lynn Bousman -RRB- like the latter , `` Repo ! '' is really unlike anything that 's been done in not only the horror genre , but the entire medium of film . It 's nearly impossible to categorize the film it 's a sci-fi , a horror , a musical , and a drama all in one . In fact , the only category the film can be filed under with certainty is as a failure . What could 've been one of the most original entries in the horror genre for this decade , ends up being nothing more than a mish-mash of stringed-together musical numbers with some blood and guts thrown in . It 's the year 2057 and an epidemic of organ failure has spread across the globe . However , Rotti Largo sees an opportunity to make money from this epidemic and thus , GeneCo is created , quickly becoming a multi-billion dollar company . GeneCo offers transplants for faulty organs , which must be paid off in installments , similar to an automobile agency . When people fail to make their payments , GeneCo sends out a Repo Man , whose job it is to get said organs back , usually by slitting open his intended target and tearing them out . However despite starting the successful business , Rotti Largo feels as if his time is limited , and he now has to decide which one of his three delinquent children he must hand the reigns to . Once he realizes none of his own offspring are suitable , he eventually sets his eyes on Shilo , a teenage girl afflicted with a life-threatening disease . What follows is a series of intertwined story lines revolving around Shilo , Rotti and the Repo Man himself , as Rotti pursues Shiloh to be the heir of GeneCo . The premise is one of the most original in any horror film this year , and the ideas of conglomerates taking over the jobs public services , such as hospitals , to help feed a peculiar organ fashion trend , is a chilling comment on the nature of North American society and its media-controlled environment . The plot is very much a horror twist on classic dystopian literature , such as `` Brave New World '' and `` 1984 '' . Unfortunately , the movie pays little attention to developing the story , preferring to spend more time on mind-numbingly boring musical numbers . Understandably , an opera usually is comprised of songs in place of regular dialog ; however , here it comes at the expense of the story . Not much happens throughout the films running time maybe about forty minutes worth of story in the whole hundred minutes and the rest is just overdone , overwrought music video sequences . Throw in the fact that not enough time is spent developing the seemingly endless amount of characters , and you 've got yourself a film that falls way short of its potential . Repo ! is being marketed as a `` cult '' film and cult films are n't always known for being the strongest films in terms of character and story . Unfortunately , Repo ! is just too tedious for there to be any fun to be had . The musical numbers are a jumbled mish-mash of opera , industrial , punk-rock , and heavy metal . Although I 'm personally not one of those `` Rocky Horror '' fanatics , the tunes were catchy ; they stayed with you . With Repo ! , there 's nothing that will stay with you once the films over , let alone anything that sounds remotely pleasant to the ears . Bousman would 've been wise to at least have incorporated some sort of action throughout the musical numbers , but characters seem regulated to standing around as they belt out their numbers . Considering 95 % of the film is told through music , there is a lot of standing around going on , and not much else , save for a couple of gore gags . Bousman would have been wise to strip the film of the opera aspect completely and focus on developing the other aspects of the film , but then again , the musical aspect is key to the `` cult '' status that this movie is trying so hard to obtain . However , cult films can not be manufactured . There is a huge difference between Rocky Horror and Repo ! : Rocky Horror came out of nowhere and slowly developed a cult following over the years as audiences connected with it . Repo ! already had a fan following before it had even finished filming . It 's a film where everything from the stars -LRB- genre faves like Anthony Stewart Head and Bill Moseley -RRB- to the genre -LRB- musicals are frequently cult films -RRB- have been employed to create a `` cult '' film . A production company ca n't make a cult film . Audiences make a cult film . That 's why Repo ! will fizzle out and be regulated to DVD obscurity , while Rocky Horror will continue to play in theaters for many more years to come . - Dylan , allhorrorfilms.com " ,2
" Well , it certainly is unique ! . I watched this film with my daughter and her college friends . I think that there is a significant difference in how you 'll like it base on your age . Among teens and college students , this is a very hot film . Among older viewers , it 's a bit incomprehensible -- though I was surprised that Leonard Maltin gave such a positive review for the film . Several of the teens watching with me were singing along while my daughter kept covering her eyes at the goriest moments . Me , I just sat there and felt that the plot was awfully convoluted and had a lot of gaps , though I did admire the uniqueness of the film . I guess this is a sign that I am just getting old ! The film is a rock opera unlike any other . The music is certainly NOT the type you can hum along with or you 'd expect to hear on the radio . Instead , it 's as if they merged traditional opera with THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW , the stage play `` Les Mis rables '' and a traditional slasher film -- with gallons and gallons of blood and tons of gore . Because it 's such an odd combination , it 's a truly surreal experience . And speaking of surreal , think about the strange casting -- Paul Sorvino , Anthony Head , Sarah Brightman and ... Paris Hilton !? Despite the oddness of the cast , it did work pretty well . For the first time ever , Hilton seemed well cast as a self-absorbed lady who is addicted to plastic surgery . Her singing , while not great , was certainly NOT an embarrassment and she was more than capable . As for the plot , this is one of the weakest points . In many ways , it seemed like it was never truly complete and it left me a bit confused here and there . I know they are talking about making a prequel , but I really wish that had been made first in order to fill in the gaps . In order to fill the viewers in on the back story , graphic novel-style graphics are inserted here and there to fill in the gaps and explain the characters . However , some -LRB- such as Sorvino 's demented children -RRB- seemed to have no discernible motivation and I also was left wondering who and where there mother is and why they were total psychos . Also , the cities appear to have been blown to pieces and you wonder what has happened to the government and society . The film begins near the middle of the 21st century . Apparently some sort of plague hit a few years back and caused widespread organ failures . In the midst of the death and carnage , Sorvino 's company created a `` cure '' -- synthetic organs for the masses . However , because many could not readily afford them , a `` buy now-pay later '' scheme was created . But , because some defaulted , `` repo men '' were created to repossess the organs if they failed to pay . In the midst of this , there is a concurrent plot that never really seemed complete . A character named `` Graverobber '' and others have begun harvesting some sort of drug from corpses . You see this guy here and there and he 's obviously been inserted in the film to please the ladies , but he is never really explained and the drug angle is never really realized . My daughter disagrees , as she sees him as an archetypal Fool -- like a combination narrator , comic relief and the only character who seems to know what 's going on in the film -- sort of a literary device . Regardless , he just seemed to appear randomly and I wish there 'd been some back story for him or necessary reason for his inclusion . The main plot involves a sick relationship between Sorvino and Anthony Head -LRB- who , secretly , is a Repo Man -RRB- . Years earlier , Sorvino 's girlfriend left him and married Head . She died and left a daughter who Head adores but also smothers in his own little cocooned world . There 's a lot more to this plot than this , but I do n't want to introduce spoilers . If I were scoring this film only on how much I enjoyed watching it , I probably would only give it a 4 or a 5 . It was a bloody , disjointed and disgusting film . However , this is a hard film to rate and I need to consider how innovative and unique the film is as well -- and in this department , it certainly rates a 10 . Overall , my score of 7 seems like a reasonable compromise . I would love to see similar style films in the future , but with the blood and senseless violence toned down a bit . " ,7
" The most visually stunning yet atrociously awful movie ever . . Rare is there a movie I feel so compelled to comment on as this one . Perhaps it was because I went into `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' expecting what people told me is the next `` Rocky Horror Picture Show '' to be at least as decent as `` Shock Treatment . '' But I came out disappointed and I was n't the only one in the room annoyed by the raving fan that told us this movie was brilliant and continued to do so after it was over . The visuals were almost the only thing I liked about this movie . From the ever-dark city to the stiff women singing in the graveyard and even the comic slide shows this movie 's visuals were flamboyant and interesting . Both Sarah Brightman and Paris Hilton gave surprisingly astonishing beauty to the Gothic style . But anyone who 's seen a recent George Lucas film knows visuals do n't make a movie great or even decent . The movies most appealing aspect is it 's genre , a Rock Opera . Of course this is the most appealing aspect until you hear the instrumentals and singing . The only redeeming singer being Sarah Brightman who sees surprisingly little screen time aside from some transitions between scenes and the very end . Although I was surprised by Anthony Head and Paris Hilton . However any talent in singing was squashed by lyrics that must have just been salvaged from a script that had nothing to do with music . The biggest thing it lacked was any hint of a thought out rhythm . The only thing that hints that the lyrics were meant to be musical is the occasional rhyme and repeating verses . On top of this the instrumentals sound formless as if they were made up on the spot . I 'm no musician but even Gwar sounds better and they admit to the musical aspect of their songs being utter crap . Throughout all this rocking it 's easy to forget that there 's a story being told . A story that 's forgettable in almost every way . I say almost because the setting was interesting and brutal . But the setting is bogged down by the boring , self-pity plot . The yawn inducing plot is interrupted several times by the seemingly pointless Zydrate harvesting grave robber who 's part in the plot ends up minuscule and random making him nothing more than a narrator with a lot of screen time . While the movie felt like it was hinting at trying to be somewhat funny with Luigi and Pavi Largo I could only produce a slight chuckle at Pavi 's strange reactions and mannerisms . If the rest of the movie did n't feel like it was taking itself seriously maybe these could have gotten more chuckles from me . In the end I can only recommend this movie to people who absolutely love Gothic styled movies and swim in their own pity . " ,4
" worthless . This felt like a worthless piece of work through and through . Not a single song sounded like it was written by someone with ears , and the performances of them were even worse . The acting was just as bad , making several failed attempts at drawing an emotional response from the audience . Not only did the film suffer from poor performances , but it was executed poorly . Cinematography constantly made me dizzy -LRB- even on my small 37 '' -RRB- and the constant cuts almost induced seizure . Unfortunately REPO failed to live up to its hype , it had nothing to say , and little entertainment value . If your a fan of musicals , stay away , REPO may reposess all faith in the genre . " ,1
" A continuation of the 21st century disease . Compared to the Rocky Horror Picture Show ? Cult classic ? A breath of fresh air ? ... Sliced bread ? Good grief , people . Pull yourselves together -LRB- because the Repoman has obviously pulled your limbs apart -RRB- Where do I even begin ? Let 's begin by bullet-pointing the whispers that redundantly reverberated throughout the film . SEXY . ROCK . OPERA . SEXY : Sure , sexy to some sad middle-school rejects who nightly beat off staring at the `` intimates '' section on the Hot Topic website . For the rest of us who have grown up some , the appeal of the clich d mass-produced Gothic image is more of a bore than eye candy . Poorly choreographed hip-gyrations ? Undead cabaret garb ? White faces with deep , blackened eyes ? Sorry , Marilyn Manson , we 've seen it before and no amount of Emily the Strange reproductions will make it any more sublime . CHEAP . ROCK : Decades of musical brilliance is a lot to stand up to , but come on ! This movie contained quite possibly the most generic and uninspiring music I 've ever heard . These composers fall back on painfully stereotypical , `` gnarly '' riffs . If musical phenomena was what they were going for , why neglect the creative possibilities and settle for Kelly Clarkson-esquire noise ? OPERA : OK , we get it . Opera means everything must be sung . But could n't the writers be just a tad bit more poetic or virtuoso with the lyrics ? Mother of God . The lyrics are so simple and literal and the film might as well have been an `` Learn English Now ! '' instructional video for Russian immigrants . Cult classics like Rocky Horror are well respected because of their incendiary choruses and captivating lines . This rock opera was basically a badly written script , spoken with changes in intonation and whines . Now that we 've covered the amazing aspects of this thrill ride , I have a few more notes on the overall bad aftertaste that this film left behind . There was NO plot or character development . Repoman remained bitter and overcome with guilt , Shilo remained whimpering , clueless and oblivious to what 's going on , and the graverobber remained creepy and unnecessary . Whatever character there remained was stereotypical , shallow , and unmoving to the point where you did n't give a flying organ if everyone just died so that the movie could end sooner . Not to mention , for a movie that was n't supposed to be taken seriously , the makers of the movie also did n't take it very seriously . This movie was basically a transparent display of our own obsession with bloody porn , only instead of being executed in a satirical , stylish manner , it just turned out to be exactly what it was supposed to deface . Save your money , go rent Rocky Horror -LRB- Get the UK version ! -RRB- And yes , it WILL fade into obscurity , no matter how many fetish parties you will throw in its name . " ,2
" Repo ! rocks ! . In a dystopian future , a worldwide epidemic has turned organ replacement into big business ; unfortunately , those unable to keep up payments on their new body parts face a terrible fate a visit from the Repo Man . As much as I dislike Darren Lynn Bousman 's unnecessary sequels to Saw , at least their success at the box office has given the director the industry clout required to get a far more interesting and adventurous project off the ground Repo ! The Genetic Opera , the goth rock musical which he first pitched to investors in 2006 with a 10 minute short starring Shawnee Smith and Michael Rooker . Although the excellent combo of Rooker and Smith does n't appear in this feature length version , the alternative cast that Bousman has assembled for his twisted tale is equally impressive : in the lead role of the Repoman we get Anthony Head , who proved that he could belt out a decent tune in ` Once More With Feeling ' , the musical episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer ; Spy Kids star Alexa Vega appears as his daughter Shilo Wallace and displays a great set of pipes ; operatically trained actor Paul Sorvino plays Rotti Largo , despicable boss of powerful organ company GeneCo ; and West End star Sarah Brightman warbles away as a once-blind singer whose eyes are on the never-never . Hell , even socialite and amateur porn-star Paris Hilton gives surprisingly solid support in her not-too-taxing role as Largo 's self-obsessed , image-conscious bimbo daughter Amber . These amazingly talented performers -LRB- and Paris -RRB- throw themselves enthusiastically into their roles undeterred by the fact that , thanks to its dark style , subversive narrative , some extreme gore , and lack of instantly catchy tunes , the film is unlikely to find itself much of an audience beyond discerning fans of both cult cinema and alternative rock , people who understand that a little effort on the viewer 's part is sometimes required to fully appreciate a work of art . I found Repo ! The Genetic Opera to be a lot of fun the first time round , but I suspect that with further viewings -LRB- leading to a little more familiarity with the tunes -RRB- , it may become an even more enjoyable experience in the future .

" A chance passed up ... . Wow ! This could have been in the league of the Rocky Horror Picture Show . It could have been an instant classic . But it seems , they let the chance go by . The story is so utterly clich , it almost hurts . And the music is SO bad , I am so glad this is over . To me it sounded like always the same guitar riff , with really , REALLY bad lyrics shouted or spoken to it . It 's rarely real singing at all . And I promise you , you will never listen to the soundtrack , because there is no `` song '' worth remembering on it . I am kinda sad though . The idea itself has so much potential , I really was looking forward to liking this . If only it were n't executed so badly . A shame really ... " ,3
" The Things You See At The Graveyard ! . Repo ! The Genetic Opera was quite a unique and completely newfangled sort of viewing experience for me , as I went through various stages of appreciation whilst watching the film . At first , in the video store while deciding and during the opening 15 minutes , I felt very skeptical and started to mentally prepare myself for yet another gigantic failure of nowadays hyped horror movies . Then , gradually , I more and more began to acknowledge the originality factor of the plot and special kind of pitch black humor . The constant and anti-rhythmic singing was still annoying and I still could n't see an instant cult classic in it , but at least it started to get compelling . Finally , halfway through the movie and further to the climax , I was totally sold and literally worshiped every tiniest little aspect about Repo ! The songs and music became extremely addictive , the character drawings properly unfolded , the intensity suspense level rose to a nearly unseen peak , Darren Lynn Bousman 's dared and eccentric filming styles and gimmicks completely came to their right and all the tiny little details that have cult written all over them suddenly became noticeable . I never before experienced my opinion gradually changing during a viewing , but then again , Repo ! The Genetic Opera is n't your average and everyday type of horror movie . Unquestionably this is n't suitable for all tastes , but if you like darkly macabre set pieces , unhinged gore , unconventional story lines and sardonic comedy ; you are definitely advised to check it out ! On the condition that constant singing does n't bother you , of course , as it does remain an opera . In the near future , millions of people died as a result of viruses that cause the collapsing of essential organs . The planet 's savior was Rotti Largo , as he made organ transplants a wide-scaled and affordable business . However , his company GeneCo holds the right to violently repossess the organs in case the patients fail to make their payments in time . The relentless Largo is terminally ill himself and desperately seeks a successor for GeneCo . His offspring are ill-suited due to their bizarrely eccentric personalities . Meanwhile , the professional Repo Man has personal problems as well , because his chronically ill teenage daughter Shilo is eager to leave her isolated existence and curious about the vicious outside world . The wholesome of Repo ! ... may look morbid and unsettlingly grim , but in fact the real emphasis lies on the dramatic undertones and tragedy elements in the screenplay . The vile acts of organ repossession are actually just footnotes in a story revolving on loss of lovers , revenge , betrayal and heritage . The sub plot and supportive characters are next to brilliant as well . For example the creepy persona of the Graverobber , who lures surgery-addicted people on the runs with drugs he extracted from dead bodies at the graveyard . Or the fantastically flamboyant heirs of Rotti Largo and the ideally apt people that depict them ! Bill Moseley -LRB- House of 1.000 Corpses , Texas Chainsaw Massacre II -RRB- practically plays himself as the hot-tempered surgeon and Paris Hilton in a rare gracious performance shines as the vainglorious daughter addicted to power and plastic surgery . Obviously the top-billed cast members are elite as well , with the cherubic Alexa Vega , Anthony Head and veteran Paul Sorvino . Especially during the finale , set in an actual opera building , contains some of the most wondrous music and singing -LRB- Sarah Brightman is stupendous -RRB- and the last act is downright chilling . I 'm totally hooked on Repo ! The Genetic Opera , almost as much as I was hooked on The Rocky Horror Picture Show when I first saw it . Hopefully , it 'll become an equally big hit in the next few decades . " ,9
" I want my money back . I watched about 15 minutes of this movie and turned it off . Think Phantom of the Paradise , but with a lower budget , worse songs and only one good actor . I liked Phantom of the Paradise , ca n't say the same for this movie . The box says Horror\/SciFi ... more like funny horror-poor scifi-musical . Fantasy-musical would be more like it . The premise is that -LRB- among other things -RRB- congress passes a bill allowing this organ transplant company to repossess transplanted organs . Some guy in a funny suit chases transplantees around and and hacks em up enough to get their organ out . Of course a garbage truck comes along for the body , and everybody has to sing about it -LRB- and everything else -RRB- . If they had left the bad songs and singing out , I might have sat through it . The only reason I did n't give it a 1 is because there are other movies -LRB- very few -RRB- I stopped sooner and I 've sat through some pretty awful movies . I only paid $ 14 for it , but I 'd rather have used that money for anything else This will be going into my never to be watched again cupboard . " ,2
" Utter and Complete Crap . It is one thing when a direct to DVD movie turns out to be crap . They are working with no name actors and no production values . It is quite another when a movie that clearly did have backing turns into a sludgepit . Repo : A Genetic Opera is about a future society where a big corporation butchers people on the street when they do n't make the payments on their organs -LRB- and you thought your credit card company was tough ! -RRB- Of course , everyone is singing when this is going on . The special effects crew worked overtime in providing us with gallons of gore . The sad thing is , there are actually some good actors involved here , including Paul Sorvino , who looks like he is n't even trying in some scenes . Oh , yeah , and Paris Hilton is in here too , but thankfully , her scenes are few and far between . This was apparently a stage play at one point , and it plays like one . And I do n't mean that in a good way . At the Movies called this the worst movie of the year , and I ca n't blame them . " ,1
" I am sorry :--LRB- . This might have been great , but it 's not . Honestly ? `` Reefer Madness '' raised the bar for musical-movies tremendously . And `` Repo ! '' spend a fortune and still failed ... What 's good about this ? Great exterior shots ! No one was afraid of gore . Nice songs , some even more than nice . Great stylish introduction of the main characters as comic . Looks so nice ! Prologue and epilogue ... classic ! Background story ? Exciting ! -LRB- I wish we had Max Headroom on DVD at last ... -RRB- On the other side ? They spoiled almost everything . The timing lacks . The pace stumbles . The story and motivation gets driven away and hardly coming back . Music ? what 's so nice about music ? yes , you can recognize it . Ever heard of leitmotiv or -LRB- as wikipedia translates it -RRB- leading motif ? IMHO that 's what musicals are living from . And of course from the depth coming along when new layers get put on top of each other and moved around ... what works with music works also in literature ... conditioning somehow ... This one does none of this ... Story : nice but lost Story-telling : pretty poor Music : OK till nice ... Usage of music in a movie : as bad as the story-telling -LRB- even the arrangements of music had timing issues and spoiled most of the fun ... -RRB- The budget and the actors tell me that someone tried too hard to deliver something great ... they just failed . ... and I am sorry for that . It could have been easily an 8 but I am so disappointed from this waste of effort . At least we got to see the long awaited comeback of Rupert Giles as `` ripper '' ;--RRB- " ,4
" Stolen Concepts ... . This movie , from its beginning to the end is a complete copycat ! A complete mixture of some brilliant ideas which were used before ! The costumes , colors , atmosphere , characters , posters tons of other things are directly copied from the legendary game called BIOSHOCK . To be more specific let 's jump into the movie 's main plot . In the near future an epidemic causes human organs fail rapidly . When everybody thinks there 's no hope , a company comes into play , financing organs to the people ! What 's this company 's name ??? GENECO !! But why the word `` GENE '' ? Is there any relationship between Organ Implants Genetics ? NO ! Why then ? The answer is so simple . In Bioshock player can mutate his own `` GENES '' by injecting a liquid to his body with a hypodermic needle . To buy this tonics of mutation player must go to a `` GENEBANK '' . Ring a bell huh ? By the way this liquid mutagen is called `` Adam '' . Now guess where this Adam liquid comes from ? `` DEAD BODIES '' . Creatures called Little Sisters harvest `` GLOWING '' liquid from the `` DEAD BODIES '' with a `` HYPODERMIC NEEDLE '' . Huh that 's all the same in this movie ; the chemical called Zydrate how they harvest it from corpses . Soooo , moreover ... In Repo The Genetic Opera after the company Geneco starts to finance organs , people become obsessed with surgery . They become addicts of implants . They constantly want to improve , to look better maybe . This whole surgery addiction idea comes directly from Bioshock ! One of the characters in Bioshock is called Dr. J. S. Steinman . Let 's know more about him . Paragraph below is from Bioshock Wiki . `` Dr. Steinman is a high-profile cosmetic surgeon in Rapture , he is the main antagonist of the second level Medical Pavilion . A perfectionist , Steinman was in love with his work , so much so that he became obsessed with the human anatomy . Wanting to become a `` Pablo Picasso of surgery '' , Steinman began to mutilate his unfortunate patients ' bodies in horrific ways usually resulting in death . Upon the player 's first encounter with him , Steinman can be heard wondering out loud why humans have two of most body parts . His fixation on physical perfection , combined with the effects of increased use of ADAM , turn him from a surgical perfectionist into an `` artistic '' monster . '' Also in Bioshock people are obsessed with their mutations they become addictive to both tonics surgeries ! And one last more . The story of Repo takes place in near future right ? Then why in the hell are all these posters of this movie are Vintage\/Retro Style ? The answer is simple again . They are directly copied from Bioshock by style . Posters with retro slogans like `` A New Sensation from Geneco ! '' . In Bioshock it 's `` Evolve Today ! Do n't be a dolt , Use Electro Bolt '' Colors tones ... they 're all the same . There are so many stuff I did n't mention which are very similar to Bioshock . And these similarities are far more than innocent inspirations . Anyway take all these concepts I 've just written , add a little bit of Tim Burton , finally conclude your so called original movie with an environment just like Blade Runner 's . There you have it !!! Repo The Genetic Opera . " ,1
" The Rocky Horror Repo Show : Paris Hilton 's inner values . This is the kind of movie you do n't see every day : a trashy science fiction slasher musical mixing live action and cartoon artwork . Think `` Sin City '' meets `` The Phantom of the Opera '' , complete with parts of the latter 's original stage cast , and a dash of `` Kill Bill '' thrown in . Need I say more ? So let 's look at the cast . Alexa Vega , who plays Shilo and will turn 20 next week , has been in movies for 15 years . It seems she really has what it takes . True , she \* does \* have a cool name -LRB- yes , it 's her real name -RRB- and good legs . I guess that 's all it takes to make a starlet these days , or ever took . Anthony Head is brilliant in the Jekyll-and-Hyde part of Shilo 's loving father by day , organ Repo Man by night . He is all Anthony Hopkins could ever hope to be and more . He also gets the best songs , namely a ballad recounting his life as a widower , doubling as a tribute to his late wife : `` Years have come and gone without you , Marni . '' Also , do n't miss Paris Hilton in the role of her lifetime : meet Amber Sweet , a slutty heiress addicted to cosmetic surgery . Talk about type-casting . The only thing I ask , why is n't Meat Loaf in this ? `` Repo ! '' looks , feels , and sounds like it was made for him . Perhaps they 'll have it re-made as a real musical or a concept album some day , with him as organ loan shark Rotti Largo , Avril Lavigne as Shilo , Marylin Manson as Bling Mag , and Alice Cooper , the Grandmaster of Gore himself , as Nathan Wallace , aka Repo Man . " ,8
" Tailor made for fat chicks that shop at hot topic . Utter PAINFUL dross . Anyone comparing this to Rocky Horror is dead wrong . Rocky horror have fun songs , a fun story and was fun . Repo is full of on-the-nose lyrics a 6 year would write to narrate the lame plot . The music is simply horrid and the whole thing is painful . What else do you expect from the guy that insisted an perpetuating the worst horror franchise in memory ? Do yourself a favor and skip this movie , find a GOOD musical created by some people with talent and stop inflating Bousman 's head -LRB- I say that having talked to Bousman before the premier of this movie - the premier I wanted sooooo bad to walk out of -RRB- . This movie will fade away . Good riddance . " ,1
" Saw it at the world premiere last night . A movie got to be pretty bad for me to actually walk of the theater 30 minutes into the film but that exactly what happen last night when i saw this movie . It 'S not that the acting is awful because it 's not , the acting is pretty good and the songs are really catchy and full of energy but the problem is that even with that positive side , this movie just look incomplete . It 's like they did n't have the budget or the time to finish the script and shot it so it does n't look so amateurish and that 'S a problem . So i 'm know that they got time before releasing it to the general public , so they should take that time to find re-edit the movie so that you do n'T see all the problems that this movies as . " ,4
" breath of fresh air . A breath of fresh air in these formula times . While everyone else cashes in on old titles , brands and superheros , the film is surprisingly unique . Totally new age and ultra hip , it makes u feel you hang somewhere between the future and the past . A totally non-earthy feel , yet human storyline and characters makes for a strangely ` happy ' movie.The is story is marvelously set by the comic strips in the introduction , on to which the whole family\/love drama is pasted on . The musics great , especially ` Zydrate Anatomy ' and throughout the movie the story and dialoges are brilliantly delivered in songs , and even if your are not a fan of musicals , this will make you want more . BRILLIANT !! , although the ending could have been more ... dramatic " ,8
" Pure Amazing . This is simply the greatest movie I have ever seen . I HATE musicals and operas but even i LOVED this movie with a passion . The music is truly splendid and the singing is perfect . The movie is also REALLY funny -LRB- along with the obvious blood and guts -RRB- lions gate films really should have made more of a fuss over this movie as far as advertising and what not goes . Ever since I saw this movie I have been ranting and raving about it to all my friends and i have even pulled a lot of them into it and made them huge fans as well . Weather you like horror movies , comedies , musicals , or sci-fi you will LOVE this movie . I encourage everyone who enjoys any of the for mentioned genres -LRB- even a little bit -RRB- to go and watch this movie . " ,10
" A new obsession ... . So I do n't often get overly excited about movies . I love movies but lately it seems the ones coming out are copies of each other in genres that just do n't appeal to me . However , when I heard about this movie I was intrigued . My interest was piqued and I went looking for more information . I found my first Repo ! song on myspace . It was a moment for me . Here was something unique and sensational . Here was something I could watch and be amused and involved in . I could tell with the first line of music from the song Zydrate Anatomy that I would be hooked on the sheer fun of this movie . I 'll admit that it 's not for everyone but this movie is absolutely for me !!! It is my new favorite movie and my new obsession ! " ,10
" New fav film . Repo has taken the spot as my favorite film . A truly amazing -LRB- and eclectic -RRB- cast , killer soundtrack , and one of the most visually appealing films of all time , Repo is not to be missed . Dark , violent , sexy , and funny , it 's a film you have to see at least once in your life , unless you 're like so many that see it over and over and over again . I saw it -LRB- for the 3rd time -RRB- last night and the energy was simply amazing . If you 're cool , you 'll quickly learn all of the songs and not be able to get at least one of them out of your head . It did n't get a full theatrical release so grab the DVD . If you did n't already love Bill Moseley or Sarah Brightman , you will after this . They better make a sequel ! " ,10
" Revel in your abandon . Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was well received critically and commercially in 2007 . I did n't anticipate another film would capitalize on its success so soon . Repo ! The Genetic Opera has impressive visuals and visceral gore , but nothing else in common with Tim Burton 's better film . Burton , probably because he adapted Sweeney Todd from a play , kept the premise simple . Guy is angry at another guy and eventually kills him . Repo ! has too much plot . The film does n't have sufficient running time for it to develop . Characters simply regurgitate obvious information we already deduced . I admire the story , and I hope another film is adapted from its story . Repo ! confirms the bleak future predicted by Blade Runner . This movie takes place about thirty years after that one and society has further deteriorated . A haze persists , even during daytime . If the United States government has any influence , it is to appease large corporations that saturate cityscapes with Paul Verhoeven advertising . It is constant and inescapable . Whatever city in which Repo ! occurs is subjected to the desires of GeneCo , ultimate counterexample to the Hippocratic Oath . GeneCo profits by selling organs to patients who need them , with financing options . Having read economic history from early 21st century textbooks , GeneCo does not tolerate late payments . It lobbied Congress to permit reclaiming its property by whatever means necessary . Those assigned to punish defaulters are Repo Men . Armed with black latex and My Bloody Valentine weapons , they murder anyone who fails to meet monthly payments . Our protagonist is Shiloh Wallace , a teenager with a rare disease that requires her to stay indoors . Her father is the mysterious Nathan Wallace who lovingly protects her from everything while he sullies his hands looking for GeneCo property . Her mother died during childbirth and Nathan never forgave himself for her death . So , his penance is serving GeneCo and its president , Rotti Largo . Largo is about to die and must find an heir to his company . None of his children are worthy , and no one else in Repo ! is either . He decides to pass his title to Shiloh , after revealing his courtship of her mother . The signing will occur at GenCo 's own corporate-sponsored Genetic Opera . He Shiloh rebukes his offer following a bloody confrontation involving her father 's death . As the credits scroll , we see Largo 's deed in the hands of the street hoodlums , where it belongs . Almost all lines are sung rather than being spoken . A record 64 songs were recorded for this movie , about forty of which should not have been included . Many are purposeless experiments that make you stop and think `` why am I listening to this ? '' They blur together in an amorphous amalgamation of mediocrity . If you want to make a bloody musical , fine , you do that . Do n't simply add guitar riffs to regular speech and call it a song . The songs themselves are n't as poor as some vocalists are . Alexa Vega , who plays Shiloh , can not sing menacingly enough to convince me of accepting Repo ! 's bleak landscape . She sounds like a Hilary Duff teeney bopper . In her earlier movies , that would have been OK -LRB- had any of them been musicals -RRB- but not in a should-have-been serious picture like this . Now , compare her lacking performance to Paul Sorvino 's -LRB- Largo -RRB- . His deep , sonorous voice suits his authoritative figure . He enhances a scene , only to have Vega , or Paris Hilton -LRB- playing one of his children -RRB- , or someone else ruin ambiance . I watched Repo ! The Genetic Opera all alone at night with no fan energy to leech . Perhaps I could have enjoyed it more in a group setting , but that would require me to watch it another time . It is a unique film but an entirely forgettable one . Composing this article , I feel no more familiar with its music than I did when I added the Blu-ray disc to my Netflix queue . Sweeney Todd is preferable because of its skillful creation of suspense and occasional comic relief . Repo ! has neither . It is n't a spooky slasher pic or a sadist comedy . The movie winks at you while you watch and whispers `` Shush , I 'm going to be a cult classic . '' Let me be like all critics who watch would-be-cult movies and pan it . " ,4
" Repo!The Genetic Opera . An alt-rock score , a hellish nightmarish world right out of The Crow , colorful , hideous characters who sing , comic interludes expressing past incidents which tell us why the story has culminated to the point we 're witnessing , and the grisly operations of a repossessor of organs working for a futuristic tyrannical businessman who practically runs the goth city where the events take place . Paul Sorvino is an obvious choice for the role of Rotti Largo , an intense , contemptible , ruthless corporate giant whose face is perfectly etched with anger and disgust , rotten to the core and dying of a cancer progressively getting worse -LRB- . . his duo of gun toting female guards shoot the doctor for bringing him the news , just a sign of how the state of life is in this depressing future -RRB- . Anthony Head is his diabolical repo man , Nathan , who seeks out those who have signed a contract with Rotti for an organ they needed to live . . if these people fail to pay for their repaired organ , it 'll be collected -LRB- . . when Nathan viciously removes the organ , surgically , we can see the bar code ! -RRB- Rotti took advantage of a terrible plight sweeping across the country , organ failures , and offered those afflicted hope , with a price . Nathan is held accountable for a past tragedy , caused by Rotti who was enraged at him for stealing away his bride , Marni . Using a poisonous drug , Rotti had it placed in the vial containing a formula Nathan was working on for his pregnant Marni who fell ill . Nathan , using the infected formula , instead causes the illness to worsen , needing to surgically remove their daughter , Shilo -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- before certain death . Caught by police for his actions in saving Shilo , Nathan must work for Rotti as a way of paying off his debt for saving him from prison . Rotti , ashamed of his horrible offspring , Amber Sweet -LRB- Paris Hilton -RRB- , Luigi Largo -LRB- Bill Moseley -RRB- , and Pavi -LRB- Nivek Ogre -RRB- wishes to leave his successful corporation , Geneco , to someone else . He sees this as an opportunity to get the ultimate revenge against Nathan who he hates with an overwhelming passion , for taking Marni away , by targeting a 17 year old Shilo , who has been isolated from the outside world , yearning to experience what life is like away from the prison of her apartment . Nathan has Shilo taking pills for a supposed blood disease , but , unknown to her , it 's actually a poison -LRB- . . he wishes for her to remain distant from a world he wants to shield her from -RRB- and Rotti will take advantage of this situation so that he can turn daughter against father . And , Rotti has plans to leave his corporation to Shilo , for she is the only one he sees fit for such an enterprize . By drawing Shilo into the outside world promising her a cure for the blood disease , Rotti can successfully trap Nathan . Also , part of the plot has `` Blind Mag '' -LRB- Sarah Brightman -RRB- , a friend of Marni 's , whose eyes were transplanted thanks to Geneco thanks in part of a contract she signed in blood , wishes to leave her singing career and have freedom from Rotti . Mag will meet Shilo with a domino effect transpiring . . it 's only a matter of time before Shilo will discover the truth about her father 's practices and the real reason behind the death of her mother . I think this is indeed a cult item , the songs will work for a certain crowd , as well as the grotesque costume designs , and the industrialized look of the world , fallen to ruin , degradation , and decadence . The alt-metal music which accompanies the songs will also work for that target cult audience . It 's extremely graphic with some unsettling surgical organ removals . I personally found the music and singers horrid -LRB- . . but that 's because I 'm not exactly a fan of musicals , especially with a cast who can not sing -RRB- and the characters overbearing . This future , though , is not supposed to be a pleasant world , so the characters and what they have to sing about reflect this devastated society . Full of surgical freaks -LRB- . . like Hilton 's Amber -RRB- , junkies -LRB- . . addicted to a hypo-injected drug lifted from corpses called Zydrate -RRB- , and hedonists . Moseley has his usual psychopath , Luigi , with an uncontrollable temperament , often stabbing folks who just so happen to cross him at the wrong time . Vegas has the central role , a pivotal part that inadvertently controls the inevitable confrontation between Nathan and Rotti . The character of Pavi -LRB- . . and to a certain extent , Amber -RRB- reminded me of Eyes Without a Face , with his face covered by a skin mask . . I kind of wondered if this was a homage of sorts . Hilton was expertly cast as a self-absorbed drug-addicted tramp who is obsessed with surgery , and with designs of being a star that takes the place of the beloved Mag . Director Darren Lynn Bousman shoots with soft focus photography , and the bleak world looks lifted right from a computer screen . Vega has an innocence and vulnerability that works for the part of an angel lost in a nightmare where fiends and miscreants lurk around every corner . The make-up effects are quite effective , particularly during those notorious organ removal sequences -LRB- . . and a marvelous reveal of Amber 's ruined visage -RRB- . " ,4
" Hackneyed , but different . . OK , so apparently I 'm uncommon for disliking this movie . I should mention that I wanted to like this movie ; I like Anthony Stewart Head and I like musicals , -LRB- and Saw , for that matter -RRB- , and I thought the movie sounded `` fun . '' I was sorely disappoitned . If there 's anything positive I can say about this movie , it 's that it really commits to its own style . For better or worse , the film never breaks from its bleak dystopian opera style , and I admit it must 've taken some strong visual artists and directors to pull that off . Musically , while not my cup of tea , I 'll also grant that it 's a true opera , where all the dialogue is sung -LRB- well , mostly -RRB- . So I give the filmmakers credit for actually making an opera here . Unfortunately , everything else about the movie was sorely lacking or simply clich d. Characters are poorly developed , mostly stereotypes with no spark or idosyncrasy -LRB- not to blame the actors , most of them do fine -RRB- . The dialogue is forgettable -LRB- some of the lyrics are just stupid -RRB- . The plot is also incredibly thin -LRB- and predictable -RRB- . The movie focuses too much -LRB- and somehow not enough -RRB- on back story of the characters , while almost completely dropping the main `` plot '' of the Repo man . Truth be told , very little actually happens in this movie at all . A couple of character `` arcs '' -LRB- although they are predictable to the point of being uninteresting -RRB- , and that 's it . The movie gives you the `` set-up '' for the plot in the first 10 minutes ... and does n't develop it any further beyond that . Not enough `` happens '' in this movie to connect the plot points here . It just barely concludes the story in the last 10 minutes . Finally , I should say that there is definitely the issue of personal taste at play here . The movie has a strong style , but personally , I found it overambitious , empty , and sometimes annoying . The melodies -LRB- while sung well -RRB- were completely forgettable , the dialogue was lame , the movie has a resounding `` low-budget '' feel , and the characters are poorly developed and written . But if you love low-budget pseudo-gory poorly written B-operas , give this one a shot . " ,3
" Loved this . LOVED this !!!! Not in the crazy I 'm - your-number-1-fan way that most of the audience were dressed up in -LRB- BEFORE they 'd even seen it , we were at the Seattle opening night ! -RRB- , but in the quiet way I appreciate a really great movie that is much more than it first appears to be . Darren , Terrence and Joe Bishara were there last night , and were completely lovely and gracious , staying well past 2am to sign fan posters , cards , boobs , you name it . Guys , you ROCKED West Seattle last night ... Come back any time , I 'm sure there will be another line that long around the block to get in again , probably bigger . . Repo is the kind of movie that people tell their friends about , and I 'm sure the audience will explode for this one . I feel very lucky to have been there last night , and had some one on one time with the 3 of you . Lionsgate , you really think this one is n't worth supporting ? Let me tell you , you 'll be kicking yourselves in the ass for years to come , for not seeing a real gem of a movie here . This one will go big on the cult scene , absolutely guaranteed . Like the Rocky Horror , it will grow and grow , until every person you know can sing a song . Paris Hilton , Anthony Head , Sarah Brightman ? These are big people in a big movie , and it needs to be paid some serious attention . Amazing job on the music score !!! This one really is an Opera . I 'll definitely be buying the DVD , and telling all my friends , and blogging about this to get word out . Yet another case of Corporations vs `` Yes We Can ! '' Oh , and guys , next time you 're in Seattle , please do n't stay in a crappy hotel . You 're welcome at my place any time . " ,10
" The Best Film I have seen this year . I saw this last night in Seattle on the Repo ! Road Tour . It was one of the best experiences of my life . I love horror movies and I love musicals . This movie brought those two worlds together perfectly . The visuals of the film were stunning . I was amazed that they only had an $ 8 million budget . The opening shot alone was worth every penny . The story takes place 50 years in the future where organ failures crippled the globe . GeneCo could help you and prolong your life with designer organs ... for a fee . If your account becomes delinquent , you were going to be visited by the Repo Man . He will rip the organs from you body while you are still alive . Rotti Largo -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- the patriarch of the Largo clan is dying and his children -LRB- Bill Mosley , Orgre and Paris Hilton -RRB- are all hoping that he will leave GeneCo to one of them . There is also the story of Nathan and Shiloh Wallace -LRB- Anthony Stewart Head and Alexa Vega -RRB- . Nathan 's wife Marni died 17 years ago while she was pregnant with Shiloh . Since then Shiloh has been kept locked in the house with a genetic blood disorder . Her father is a doctor and tries everything he can to keep her safe , but , he also has a devastating secret . He is the Repo Man for GeneCo . That 's just the tip of the iceberg . There 's betrayals , lies , murder , and redemption . There is so much going on you do n't have a chance to get bored or look at your watch . The cast is perfect ! Yes even Paris Hilton . She does a masterful job of playing Rotti 's surgery addicted daughter . Sarah Brightman makes a wonderful feature film debut . Her voice and her mannerisms were hypnotic . Ogre was hilarious as Pavi Largo . Before this movie I had no idea who Ogre or Skinny Puppy was . I also can not help praising Terrence Zdunich as the Graverobber\/Co-Writer\/Co-Composer \/ Props Guy\/Illustrator . His voice is smooth as silk and he wrote some of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard -LRB- `` I Did n't Know I 'd Love You So Much '' -RRB- . I could actually say many words of praise for the entire cast . Never before have I seen a movie where the whole cast was perfect . A.S.H. with his stunning Jekyll Hyde like portrayal , Alexa Vega showing such depth as a sick , weak , but so angry rebellious teen , even Bill Mosley who really should not try to sing again , but was great as the Angry Largo Son . The music is some of the best I heard for a musical . I am not a big fan of hard rock or metal music . This movie blends modern and classical styles so well , you ca n't help but be in awe of the composer and the music supervision crew . the only song I could really do without is `` Mark It Up . '' I just did n't find it up to the standard of the rest of the songs . But hey , it 's only a 2 minute song . If you get the chance , please see this movie . It was made for the fans and we need to prove to Lionsgate that this film has an audience . " ,10
" Repo : Because Horror Musicals Are Killer ! . At first I was drawn to `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' because I am a fan of Tony Head . Then I was able to download the soundtrack and was blown away by the caliber of music and singing . Going to the `` Repo ! '' website I was able to finally see bits and pieces of what the movie would look like and I was astounded . There has never been a movie like this before - a truly horror musical . Many have compared this movie to `` Rocky Horror Picture Show '' but I would shy away from that . `` Rocky Horror '' is in a category all of its own , a horror comedy musical . By that rite , `` Repo ! '' , too , is in a class all of its own . I am fascinated and intrigued by this film and could watch it again and again , taking in nuances and details I missed the times before . It is truly a film that fits the times - taking a closer look at a typical class struggle , the bourgeoisie -LRB- e.g. - the Rotti 's -RRB- and the power they wield over the proletariat -LRB- e.g. - the Grave Robber and Zydrate addicts -RRB- and the inherent fights therein . Even in today 's difficult economic times everyone can understand what it is like to finance your life away with mortgages , credit cards and loans . The truly scary thing about this movie is something like this could possibly happen - who is to say that one day there wo n't be an organ shortage and they will genetically create organs for sale to the general population ? Is the world not going through medical shortages like this now as is a need for blood donations , organ donations ? I look forward to seeing what will come after `` Repo ! The Genetic Opera '' and applaud those involved with bringing this truly unique musical to the silver screen . " ,10
" A Fantastic Accomplishment and a Breath of Fresh , Blood-Misted Air ! . It 's about time I drop my review of this film , a review from someone in the demographic that all the negative critics pretend do n't exist . I got a chance to see Repo ! in its first stop on the Repo ! Road Tour , in Portland , OR . I know how poorly the film is being critiqued by those `` who make a living doing such '' , and it is , to this viewer , a terrible injustice . Fortunately , those critics are n't the only ones with voices that matter . So I 'm dropping mine . Repo ! the Genetic Opera is fantastic . Plain and simple . In having the difference between a musical and an opera elaborated upon by Terrance Zdunich , I have to say that Repo ! achieves exactly what it 's title promises . It is an opera , an ongoing stream of torrential harmony and conceptual -LRB- dis -RRB- harmony from opening to ending . Everything fits perfectly , and the fact that all those cast sing their own parts : a commendable addition . I have nothing bad to say about this film , nor should I. This movie -LRB- and those who had a hand in its conception -RRB- kept every promise made since I first heard about it many months ago . I loved every second of it . To those who find fault with the film , to those critics who gave their respectively shameful reviews , I just have to say this : it is to you all I will glance abhorrently when all of the world 's mainstream theaters are filled to the brim with tired remakes . Repo ! the Genetic Opera is the boulder planted deeply in the midst of the sluicing stream , and you all are missing something truly ground-breaking . Darren , Darren , and Terrance have brought to the screen a fantastic , murderous rock opera , and I am just thankful that I 've been fortunate enough to see it when I had the chance . This movie is going places whether the paid critics acknowledge it or not . As for recommending the film , I suggest it to anyone with a palate for the Gothic , the darkly comic , the brutal , the horrifying , the tragic , and the beautiful . All can be found bountifully in Repo ! The Genetic Opera ! " ,10
" Best movie I 've seen in a long while . . OK , I know a lot of people are going to dispute that quote , this is n't a movie for everyone , but it was amazing none the less . The flow of the movie is superb , the visual style is dark , smooth , and amazing , and the soundtrack is so catchy and powerful that I find myself singing and\/or humming one of the tunes at least twice daily . When originality in the movies seems to be deader than a WoW addicts social life , this movie comes as a great change of pace . I absolutely love this movie , and I wish I could have seen it more than once on the repo road tour . Everyone should see this film , in theaters , rent it , buy it , what ever , just see it . It may be something you like , it may not , but its still something new and out there , and it deserves support for that alone . " ,10
" Awesome ! Beyond Rocky Horror ! . Repo is superb , twisted , beautiful , and original ... did i mention the music was awesome ? It is ! Think Andrew Lloyd Webber meets Bowie , with Skinny Puppy as the band ... -LRB- ogre is in the movie yo ! -RRB- The plot was never dull , the visuals never failed to impress , and the acting was spot on -LRB- yep , even Paris was perfect in her role -RRB- For those who like goth,sci-fi , horror , you will not be disappointed.If you are into musicals , like Sweeney Todd , Moulin Rouge , Rocky Horror , Chicago , Phantom of the Opera , then you too will love this flick!I have been waiting to see how the cinematic treatment of this story would turn out , and i was surprised at how disturbing , and funny it was.The gore was top notch , from the people who did saw 2,3 , and 4 -LRB- so you know they know exactly what they are doing ! -RRB- A true opera style story with revenge , tragedy , humor , music , all rolled into one . " ,10
" When they tell you this movie will change your life , they mean it . . Let me start off by saying that I was only originally interested in this movie out of love and support to my friend , who is as close to me as a sister . I would call her and she was singing the songs , quoting the clips , and working on her fan costume plans , all before the soundtrack was even released . That being said ... I love this movie . You may ask why , and I could try to explain it to you . . but as it 's 3:30 am ... And I 've just returned from the First stop on the REPO Road Tour Screening in Portland , Oregon ... I 'm too tired to go into all the reasons why I love it . So I 'll stick with the one major one . Music . Music has a way of changing all our lives ... Of changing us as people . It inspires us . . A good song will stick with you all your life , the score , the notes , the lyrics . . all of it . Even when it 's bad it influences our lives to some degree . No one can deny that ... Music is the blood to all things creative inside ourselves . REPO the Genetic Opera is ; beginning to end , that creative blood inside us . DLB , TZ , Joe and CJ were at the screening tonight , obviously , and before the movie started they said `` This movie will change your life . '' And they are right . It may seem dramatic to compare the course of your life with seeing a movie , but it 's true . Under all the music , under all the character story lines and fantastic Art ... underneath the comedy , the tragedy and the sin that surround the Characters , the message is simple : Fueds , wars , grudges ... whatever you 're holding on to ... Let them go . . They do n't matter at the end of the world . What matter 's is what you make for yourself and where you take it . The Cast and Crew of REPO have made their stand with this movie , and they want to take it far . This is my hand to help them ... I want original pictures , original ideas , and something a little bizarre . I am the REPO Army , and I want REPO ! " ,10
" Blown Away . I had the amazing privilege to screen this movie tonight in Portland , Oregon . I do not know what Lionsgate is thinking by not doing a wider release of this title . Not since `` Tommy '' has anyone had enough balls to make a legitimate rock OPERA . This is not a musical folks . This is an Opera , but this ai n't your mommy and grandma 's opera . Amazingly cast , you may think when you look at the list of notables that you 're reading perhaps a list of people LEAST likely to star together in one film . But rather , it 's the list of amazing talent , yes TALENT , that makes this movie come to life . The visuals are completely stunning , and like a true opera , you see things that will make you laugh , things that make you cry , it will make you think , it will make you tap your feet and sing along , it will make you want to bring a GRAVEROBBER home with you . While I do agree , this movie is n't for everyone , I feel it deserves as much respect from their `` support '' as it 's predecessors . I mean , how much marketing was spent on `` Beverly Hill Chihuahua ? '' Come on people . I urge you to see this movie if you can . " ,10
" Objective Opinion . I was at the Premiere of Repo in NYC Friday night . There were many people like myself that are registered on the Repo Message boards , but unfortunately some were mainly Screaming fan girls\/boys -LRB- sorry gang it 's true haha -RRB- I 'm a Digital Film-making major and I am very disappointed at most of the critics . They will sit there and bash this movie when they honestly ca n't take it for what it is . I will admit there was a lot that could have been done . Lionsgate did not give them the biggest budget in the world . One of the catch lines for the movie is `` this is not your parent 's opera . '' Well this is n't your average Hollywood Polished Blockbuster . There were many things that had to be cut and replaced due to Budget constraints . But for what they did it was amazing . The Cinematography was original , and the way it was shot gave the entire movie a `` Comic-book-come-to-life '' feel while still feeling gritty and real . The actors gave outstanding performances and whoever cast this should receive a medal . Not only could they act , they could sing , AND do both at the same time . The visual effects while not the most stunning in the world in some parts were amazing in others - IE Blind Mag 's -LRB- Sarah Brightman -RRB- hologram-projecting eyes . This is a very original film , and has very original music that is sure to attract a major following in the spirit of Rocky Horror . I use that comparison loosely as this is nothing like Rock horror , while it can be considered in the same genera . I 'm sorry to bash the critics only to become one myself but from my point of view this movie is stunning in many different aspects . Its originality and basic concept are a refreshing change from the now standardized Hollywood blockbusters . " ,10
" Stunning , additcting , tragic , beautiful . If you like music , then you will love repo . Imagine the world of plastic surgery 100x amplified , and you will have one aspect of REPO . The cast is , for me , fresh and awesome . Paris was great , its pretty amazing how much she impressed me . Terrence Z , one of the creators , was amazing , lyrically and preforming-ly . Graverobber is quite the character , and will easily be many people 's favorite in the movie . Paul Sorvino is great as Rotti ... better than great , he IS Rotti Largo . The story is captivating , the characters moving , the visuals stunning , and the fans incredible . Seeing Repo in a theater is an event , people sing , act , yell , dance ... Take your friends , your parents , your brother your sister , no matter who they are , they 'll love it . Everyone should see this film . REPO FOR LIFE " ,10
" Wow . Repo ! was Amazing ! I do not understand how you could not like this . Great music you can not help but get into . and its not the kind of music you 'd think of when u think Opera . It is heavy , and definitely is a Rock opera ! It is so unique ! The artwork itself is amazing . The characters are interesting and in depth . You can not get sucked into just one of their story lines . The cast is also amazing ! I mean just look up ^ at the list ! some of them have such amazing voices you just get chills when they sing these songs ! I could not tear my eyes off the screen for a moment ! go see this , and actually take it in ! pay attention to all you see ! " ,10
" Loved this movie !!! . Best musical since Mullion Rouge ! Every one who liked Rocky Horror will love this movie . The ideas are all original and I have n't had so much fun in a long time . The music is great , but this movie for some reason did not make it to general theaters . I think this is a crime considering all the crap Hollywood puts in there these days . I have n't seen a movie I 've enjoyed watching for a long time and would appreciate this piece of art be available for everyone to enjoy . Sure it 's not for everyone , but neither is more than half the garbage that makes it 's way into the general theaters . Everyone should get their chance to see this Opera !!! " ,10
" Amazing ! . I was anticipating the release of this movie for awhile now . I luckily caught it at one of the few dates it was playing . I am so glad I did . It was very entertaining and had an ending I could n't have predicted . It had lot 's of good music in different styles . All the actors did a great job . I think a lot of people would like this , Sweeney Todd did well and this has better music and more gore ! I really hope it gets a wider release , the people involved with this project had a unique vision and it is deserved ! Many well known actors are in this and they do a great job singing and performing . It was like over an hour of music video . " ,9
" See it . . In the second week of September , when writing the fall movie preview for my college newspaper , I wrote : Repo ! The Genetic Opera 11\/7 -LRB- Limited -RRB- . I can not wait to see this movie . Anthony Head -LRB- Giles ! -RRB- plays a singing murder who repossesses artificial organs when the owners default on their payments . And it 's a musical ! The trailer looks great , and it 's buy the people who did saw when it was awesome . Also ? Sarah Brightman stars with Paris freaking Hilton ! The casting alone makes this movie worth the price of admission . Little did I know how much more awesome it would turn out to be . This movie is first and foremost unexpected . In a world driven forward by the grinding wheel of sequels and the dulling of the edge of entertainment , Repo ! is daringly original and cutting edge . The Genetic Opera completely lives up to it 's billing : it 's a rock opera , a `` goth opera '' sung from start to finish . The music is catchy and more driving then most dialogue , offering a playground of characterization that we do n't seem to find very often anymore . This movie is something that is unique , striving the line somewhere between Sweeney Todd , Rocky Horror and Army of Darkness . It 's an opera that is a bit horror movie , and yes there is blood here . When your main character is one who repossesses organs , there needs to be blood . The most gory scene is leavened by the choice of music though . In an age of PG-13 fake horror movies , the fact that Repo ! does n't shy away from the blood is an minor miracle especially considering the sort of audience that is going to be drawn in and create this movie as the 21st century -LRB- cure -RRB- cult classic . The blood is n't in the interest of torture porn ; the blood here comes from the furthering of the visual style . And the visual style is pretty amazing . Repo ! 's world is one in shades of dingy and neon , like every good dystopian society should be . However , the visuals are also the first place in which Bousman shows where he was hamstringed by the budget limitations that were placed upon him by the studio . In an effort to counteract that , Terrance Zdunich takes a duel role of using an animated comic-like storyboard in order to further the plot . The idea works to various levels of success , but it can occasionally seem a bit repetitive . It not only illustrates various levels of back-story , but it illustrates when they ran out of money . But for all of that , all the blood and gore and singing this story is at its very core a tale of relationships . At the heart of the tale is two families who are intrinsically bound together . The first family , Nathan and Shilo Wallace form the emotional core of the film . The performances here are brilliant . Anthony Stewart Head was always the best actor on Buffy and here he takes on the duel role of Nathan and the Repo-Man , playing both with gusto . If this movie had any studio support at all , I would predict a Golden Globe now . He has an amazing voice ; his awesomeness was not a surprise . The surprise came in the form of former Spy Kid Alexis Vega . She owns the role of Shilo Wallace . You 've heard a lot about Paris Hilton in this role . Her role is small , and she essentially plays herself . But she holds her own against Paul Sorvino which is no small feat . The other family of which Paris 's character Amber is part consists of the mentioned Sorvino as Rotti , Oghr from Skinny Puppy as Pavi and Bill Moseley as Luigi . The roles are small but pivotal , and their voices are stronger then I could have possibly predicted . Remember this name : Terrance Zdunich . Zdunich plays the Greek chorus in the form of Graverobber , and he is a tour du force in this film . Not only is his voice divine , but he also did all of the animation and co-wrote the original stage show and the screenplay for Repo ! Together , with director Darren Lynn Bousman , they form the heart of Repo . It 's a labor of love , one that extends from the world they have created to the community that they have forged . See Repo . I saw it . I saw it and loved it so much I would go back and see it again . And again . And again . It 's rare to see something different in Hollywood these days , and that 's what Repo ! is : something different . Support difference , support people who think outside the box . If you live near a showing , get out and see it . Tell your friends about it . Fight for it . But most of all , experience Repo . " ,10
" Repo ! 's gon na blow your mind , if you 'd only let it . . My friends and I had been excited for Repo ! for a pretty good while before we were able to go and see it last night . In a movie with this kind of original premise , innovative music stylings , ambitious aesthetic , and sub-culture hype , it had to be pretty damn good just to be worthy of its own components . This movie was bound from the beginning to be either completely brilliant , or a miserable disappointment . So you can imagine our giddy relief when our high expectations were continuously met , and subsequently exceeded in a splendid , bloody , catchy , and -LRB- really -RRB- prophetic mess . All we had to go on before the show was the soundtrack we 'd been listening to for the past month or so - and it 's a tribute to the creators of this fresh sound that it was pretty much all we 've been listening to . The music is unlike anything you will have heard before . Period . It 's as if one writer was walking down the hall with a stack of classic opera , and the other was dancing along with only the most rockin ' of roll , and they met in a brilliant collision in passing . `` There 's ... liberetto in my guitar rift . '' `` There 's ... guitar rift in my liberetto . '' And a bright new sound was born . Really , though , the term rock opera is NOT a clever little way to make it sound legit , this is real , true opera , sung from beginning to end , and probably one of the few times such a format would ever work with today 's audiences - especially young , horror-loving audiences . What I 'm saying with that is , Repo ! is original , unique , and GOOD , and as such can not be imitated . -LRB- I am looking at you , Reposession Mambo . -RRB- And therein lies the reason for its instant appeal as a brand-new cult classic . Repo ! was not \* trying \* to achieve that status . Cult classics are sub-culture gems of movies that are true to their own concept and simply trying to exist as the purest representation of their original idea . The showing I went to had at least a hundred people in costume already , with the actual film sight-unseen . There is something in the unique combination of elements , in the aesthetic , in the sincerity of the show , that draws out the bizarre family of the media counter-culture . If they were TRYING to achieve such a reaction , it would have been disingenuous , would have destroyed what makes Repo ! so fun to love . That feeling of investment in the project radiates from both meeting the people involved on the tour , and seeing the bizarre array of actors on the screen , all throwing themselves completely and whole-heartedly into a totally unknown element . Anthony Stewart Head brings a believable weight of humanity into the whole story , filled as it is with strange characters and caricatures , managing to maintain a brilliant dichotomy between Nathan Wallace and the Repo Man . His astounding voice and brave acting alone would be enough to make you want to watch this movie repeatedly . The fact that all the other characters are just as fun could be just an added bonus , really . Alexa Vega leaps away from her Spy Kids past and believably plays the sheltered , frightened , yet increasingly bold Shilo Wallace . It 's a pretty good bet that many a young lady , after watching this movie , will want to go out and imitate a couple of the pieces that Ms. Vega wears in the show - her Victorian-influenced stylings are a sharp and lovely contrast to the other characters ' more aggressive looks . Bill Moseley and Niveck Ogre share a wonderfully fun , quirky energy as Pavi and Luigi Largo , dosing us with a share of both horror and humor throughout the film . Paris Hilton exceeds and destroys all expectations and preconceived notions , respectively , as Amber Sweet - a role she plays with exuberance , landing no small amount of kudos for her final scenes in the movie , which had me actually feeling empathy for the spoiled-rotten princess of a character . Sarah Brightman is another surprise - I honestly did n't like her before Repo ! . I wo n't use any stronger language than that , but let 's say there was an aversion . I am now determined to go out and get some of her music , because the woman is a powerhouse of operatic , dark rock and roll with those pipes . I know that Repo ! will never be for everyone . But that can be said of all movies , all books , all music types - anything and everything , really . If one sits down expecting to have good , bloody , fun sing-along times , they will not be disappointed . If one sits down trying as hard as they can to find fault , of COURSE they 're going to find SOMETHING . Approached with a mind for new and progressive horror , Repo ! is , quite frankly , going to blow said mind . You just have to sit back and let it . You will laugh when you least expect it . You will , guaranteed , find something new . You will , yes , want to get up and sing and dance along with the actors - and with the crowds you 'll find watching it , you may just be able to . Enjoy . " ,10
" Pretentious , misguided trash . If there 's one thing I absolutely ca n't stand , it 's a film that tries to be something it 's not , and fails every step of the way . Repo ! The Genetic Opera thinks it is many things : horror , a musical , a rock opera , a cult film , artsy , and interesting . It is none of the above . Before anyone accuses me of not `` getting it , '' let it be understood that I am madly in love with the horror genre . I enjoy art films and blood-and-guts films , even bad ones . Repo ! left me reeling , not because I was bothered by the gratuitous gore , but because everything about it was full of pain . Somewhere in this mess was supposedly a plot . An evil , corrupt , futuristic company called GeneCo rules the world -LRB- oh , gee , how original -RRB- by providing people with dirt-cheap fashionable organ transplants . However , there 's a catch - if you ca n't pay on time , a guy in a mask called the Repo Man will rip your guts out . I 'm not kidding . So , we have Shilo Wallace -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- , a pale , sickly , pampered teenager who looks like she stepped out of a Hot Topic poster . She has a hereditary blood disease , and her devoted dad -LRB- Anthony S. Head -RRB- is the Repo Man . We find out this second plot twist roughly 15 minutes into the movie , eliminating any possibility that there will be real conflict or mystery . There 's also something about her dad killing her mom , but not really ; it was actually the evil GeneCo guy -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- , who now wants to turn Shilo against her dad and toward him so that he 'll have a competent heir for his conglomerate , as opposed to his three disastrous offspring , one of whom is Paris Hilton . Yes , I am confused too . About 85 % of the dialogue is sung ; this is a very bad thing . Not because rock operas are inherently bad -LRB- I loved JCS -RRB- , but because writers Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich -LRB- who also plays the Grave Robber , a narrator figure with no actual purpose -RRB- were too busy creating `` art '' to write lyrics that scan , we are treated to such accidental comic masterpieces such as `` Ashes , ashes\/dust , dust\/my children were a bust ! '' If I ruled the universe , I would make it divine law that you can not get into heaven if you have ever deliberately rhymed the words `` passing '' and `` guessing . '' Also , with the exception of Sorvino and Sarah Brightman -LRB- if you absolutely must see it , see it for her -RRB- , none of the cast can sing . Head is erratic , Bill Moseley and Nivek Ogre are ridiculous , and Vega and Paris Hilton are just plain annoying . This is not the Rocky Horror of my generation . Rocky Horror was fun , memorable , and featured extremely talented performers . Repo ! was agonizing , excruciatingly pretentious , and memorable only in its badness . Two days after seeing this film , I can not remember a single `` song '' from it -LRB- for the record , the background music sounds like the Nails-On-A-Blackboard Choir -RRB- . Repo ! will be forgotten by all but the bad-movie aficionados in a few years . `` Art '' it is not , unless you count unintentional comic gold . " ,1
" An Opera That Makes Sweeney Todd Look Like Hairspray . I saw this movie last night at a packed theater in New York City , The Angelika to be exact . I showed up with my friend Derek at 9:30 and they were completely sold out for the 10:45 showing , so we had to get tickets for the 12:45 showing . Now while that one was n't sold out , it was pretty packed , and there was a line to get into the theater an hour before show time . Now onto the movie , the basic story was simple , in the future people 's organs start failing and transplants are needed , so GeneCo appears and makes organs available to those who need them , but at a price . If you ca n't afford the price then a monthly bill plan is instated , and if you ca n't pay the bill and find yourself in debt , a Repo Man comes and repossesses the organ , and if you happen to die in the process , that 's not his problem . An interesting story idea , definitely gives me the willies just thinking about it , throw in some killer music and operatic themes and you got yourself an odd blend . A heavy metal horror opera . Sweeney Todd looks like Hairspray compared to this . The opening scene is a montage of comic book panels set to eerie music , my jaw dropped once it started . The montage gives the back story , and the way it 's done was magnificent . The comic book montages appear frequently to give some back story on various characters . In short , this movie was great . It had killer songs , memorable characters , amazing visuals , and a great cameo during one of the numbers -LRB- not gon na spoil it :P -RRB- . If you liked Sweeney Todd , then you will really LOVE Repo ! The Genetic Opera . " ,10
" A Gothic MASTERPIECE !! . 1st off do n't listen to the naysayers because this film is obviously not for the dumb masses since they will never ever understand something like this . people who have an open mind , a love of rock musicals , dark surreal imagery and characters , a bit of a dark side and are sensitive to things with a ` little ' more depth than what the average Joe enjoys will be blown by it , guarantied ... I saw the premiere at Fantasia Fest in Montreal , and all i have to say is : Cult Classic Masterpiece !! without exaggerating . the energy there was insane , palpable . Having been to 4 other Fantasia fest in past years i can safely say this was by far the most exciting of all . The director Darren Lynn Bousman was there which is awesome -LRB- common practice at Fantasia -RRB- , but in addition we had : Alexa Vega , Darren Smith , Terrance Zdunich , Bill Moseley and producer Daniel Heffner . They had a Q A at the end with everyone of them on stage . -LRB- all having watched the movie with us of course -RRB- Without giving a detailed review i can tell you this : the songs rock -LRB- pun intended -RRB- and the lyrics are beautiful and deep , Tony Head is a God as usual and has the best song in the film , Alex is at the top of her game as well and ... Paris Hilton does NOT suck , quite the contrary in fact -LRB- trust me you 'll see -RRB- . Every other performer in the movie did an outstanding job : Ogre , Moseley , Brightman , Sorvino were all genial while Zdunich as Grave-Robber was simply extraordinarily decadent and played it to perfection , also he had some of the best numbers . The visuals are breathtaking and the production values exquisite , costumes , everything ... A lot of work and love has been put into this and it shows . The audience was completely nuts and applauded after every number ... at the end credits the biggest applause and cheer was when Nivek Ogre 's name came up -LRB- not surprising at all , i wonder how many Skinny Puppy freaks were there -RRB- -LRB- lots of Goths and black clad folk , including myself is all i can say -RRB- and then the second loudest was Tony Head of course as i remember it . Anyway , it was amazing and unique right up there with Rocky Horror , but quite different because this a true Rock Opera not just a musical . Point is : go see it in theaters for the love of Hades , do n't pass up the chance . i can not stress this enough -LRB- you will regret it if you do n't -RRB- . A Gothic NIGHTMARE of epic proportions !! but such a sweet one , Enjoy darlings !! " ,10
" Mind-blowingly underrated . A kick in the teeth for original concepts . . This movie is , if nothing else , evidence that the opinions of professional critics should be taken with not just a pinch but a barrel of salt . It continues to boggle my mind that this movie is consistently trashed by critics and utterly ignored by the general movie-going public . Fantastic Cast ? Check ; Ridiculously catchy songs ? Check ; Paris Hilton 's face falls off ? ; Check Utterly gorgeous visuals , despite a low effects budget ? Check ; Musical talent that puts Les Mis to shame ? Check ; Paris HILTON 'S FACE FALLS OFF ? Check ! Honestly , this film is worth seeing just for the incredible experience of seeing Paris Hilton display a shining talent . With the exception of Anthony Head 's performance as a grieving , schizophrenic father\/mass-murderer , Miss Hilton is easily the most believable performance in a movie replete with believable and touching performances . The fact that you literally see her face fall off mid-song is just icing on the hilarious cake . It 's never an easy thing to translate a stage musical to the big screen but Repo ! does it so effortlessly it makes one wonder if the other musicals were even trying . Not one song feels shoehorned in , and virtually every aspect of plot development occurs lyrically to the beat of opera and electric guitars that blend perfectly and enter your soul via your ears . I do not exaggerate , you will be humming these songs for weeks after you first see it . There is absolutely not a single complaint I can levy against this film and you should watch it just so you can break up your steady diet of big-budget Hollywood action flicks and cookie-cutter romantic comedies with just one truly original idea . I guarantee you 'll appreciate the new flavor in your diet . " ,8
" One of my all time favorite films . I rated this title as excellent because of the pure originality of the music and plot The characters are completely believable and realistic . This is one of my all time favorite films plainly because of the fact that i think it reflects how our world is dependent of consumerism and the increase of plastic surgery , Bousman has created a very original plot which is tide together with the music and sang dialogue , this is a story of love , greed , and revenge , character deaths is another reason i love this film , all through the film Bousman really makes it so the audience connects with the characters and when one of them dies it really effects the audience . I would very much recommend this film to practically anyone who would be willing to watch it , it is a great film and has been directed absolutely brilliantly . This film is definitely in my top ten favorite all time films . " ,10
" Visionary , Twisted , Exploitative , and I loved every minute of it ... . Okay , first off , I loved this movie far more than I probably should have . To give you a little background , I grew up on musical and golden age of Hollywood type stuff ... so I 'm in no way put off by people spontaneously breaking into song in a film -- even though a lot of people are . I 've never been a huge fan of Bousman . I like dark films , but I felt like the Saw franchise lost both it 's credibility and it 's point after the first one . That said , I thought this was an incredibly bold attempt at filmmaking that hits it 's mark quite solidly . The creative process to create the whole world of Repo is incredibly unique -LRB- it started as ten minute mini-operas in underground rock clubs -RRB- , and it turns out that Bousman was perfect for the story . The plot is n't necessarily the most solid piece of storytelling ever written , but it was good enough to serve as the basic premise of another -- more serious -- film -LRB- Repo Men starring Jude Law and Forrest Whittaker -RRB- . The visuals -LRB- costuming , scenery , cinematography -RRB- are all incredibly unique and have a certain flair that ca n't be repeated anywhere -- and that is half the draw of the film for me . The acting was surprisingly good -LRB- though I thought the vocal styling of the Repoman vs. Nathan Wallace was a little overdone -RRB- and I can honestly say that this is the only movie I have seen Paris Hilton in that did n't make me want to burn her in effigy . Beware , it 's a rock opera -- which means 95 % of the dialogue happens in song . I will say that the songs are pretty well done as far as blending cohesive acting and music video film techniques . The lyrics are solid enough in that there were n't any real eye-rolling moments or hyper-stretched rhymes -LRB- ex . The Producers : Listerine , Argentine and time do n't actually rhyme , but I digress -RRB- . The characters are all pretty well sculpted in their Caricature-ness ... yes , there is intentional comic relief . The entire film is fairly over-the-top , but name a futurist sci-fi\/horror flick that is n't . If you want a walk on the weird side and want to see something pretty unique , this is a great option . " ,8
" I have so much more respect for Paris Hilton now . Your life will legitimately never be the same after you watch this movie . It is unlike anything I have ever seen in my life . The closest description I can conjure is if Sweeney Todd and The Rocky Horror Picture Show had a baby . In all seriousness , however , this really was a great movie . It is not something everyone will enjoy . But for those who do , you will fall in love in the first ten minutes . It is a rock opera unlike any other , with fantastic goth visuals and beautiful accents like Sarah Brightman 's voice . I was so overwhelmed by all of it that I did n't even notice that Paris Hilton was Amber Sweet until nearly the end of the film . Simply put , you will know whether or not you like Repo ! very quickly . I hope for the sake of your artistic life experiences that you do . " ,9
" a work of art . Art is n't something beautiful - art is something beautifully portrayed . The music is outstanding . The vocals are excellent . Sarah Brightman is a major opera star for goodness sake . And Paul S. can sing ! It 's not your sound-of-music type of musical . It is a creative , outside-the-box rock opera . If you are expecting ` Oklahoma ' or some sort of bland , bland , musical tripe - do not see this movie . Even Paris Hilton did a good job in this movie . She played the part excellently - and she had pretty good vocals . I recommend . " ,10
" Perhaps something of an acquired taste ... . RTGO is such a mishmash of the incredibly excellent with the confusingly awful and in the end , it all mixes together in an eerily beautiful way to create a genuinely wonderful film . The plot is refreshingly original -LRB- yes , the Repo Men movie was indeed a rip-off of RTGO for those unfamiliar with the timing and order -RRB- and in a time where everything that Hollywood vomits up is a remake or a sequel , this is desperately needed . It 's remarkably well balanced , the mixture of creepy , camp and fun . While it 's certainly not a serious drama in any form whatsoever , it throws these very grim things at you from time to time and kind of shocks your system and in some ways it can really make you think . The cinematography , while done on a tight budget , is haunting and rich and full of depth . Visually one of my favorite movies of the last ten years easily , it 's astounding what pure creativity and dedication can do . The costumes are almost amusingly reflective of the characters who wear them , from Nathan 's dreary grays to Shilo 's mourning garb to Mag 's elegant diva wear -LRB- as we 've since dubbed it -RRB- and Rotti 's beautifully tailored suits . I wo n't go so far as to say that the acting is top-notch , but it 's far from a lamentable disaster as some reviews would have you believe . I ca n't think of anyone whose performance I would call bad even . I am a passionate Paris Hilton hater and I 'm forced to sit here and admit that she pulled off the spoiled , self-obsessed Amber like no one else could . And as a huge Broadway fan , I have to say that it was priceless and amazing to see the gorgeous Sarah Brightman in a role so unlike what most of us are accustomed to . The music really spreads across many different genres , there 's something in the soundtrack for everyone to enjoy not just in regards to music and lyrics , but in regards to vocal qualities as well . From the raw to the perfected , I ca n't see how anyone can fail to find a voice or a song that they somehow connect with . Unfortunately , the down side of being a cult classic is that this movie is simply not for everyone . I give it glowing praise in sincere admiration for this film , but for every person like me out there , there are doubtlessly two or more who wo n't see any redeeming qualities to it . Nonetheless , I hope that anyone who 's mildly curious about this movie will give it a chance . It 's an underdog for sure , but who better to root for ? " ,9
" Definitely an Experience ! . Being a big fan of musicals , I will say I never heard of this long lost piece from 2008 and had the pleasure of watching it last night with a friend who highly recommended it . The introduction to the movie did have be doubtful of the story and film itself , it had a very Sin City air about it . I wo n't get into the characters , no one can do them justice by explaining you simply have to watch Repo ! for yourself . Grotesque and Macabre this film has me squirming early on , gut ripping yet strangely intriguing , soon enough I began to sit forward in my seat anxious for more ! The story is original , each scene in the film is a work of art , the characters are strong individually and the cast plays each part splendidly . I had read some of the critic reviews on this film and noticed they all seemed to have a hatred for Paris Hilton who plays Amber Sweet . Now I am not a fan of Miss Paris , but I found her representation of this character to be almost like a drug . She plays this part beautifully and her voice is n't as terrible as I had originally thought . Accompanied by other brilliant actors and voices this movie is a very enjoyable piece of work ! I highly recommend those who enjoy musicals to see this film . Though it may not be full of bubbles , it 's like a Sweeney Todd meets the Phantom of the Opera ! It 's a fun film for Halloween . And I also feel this movie could be great to teach teenagers about cosmetic surgery and drugs . " ,9
" If Circus of Horrors did a movie this would be it ! . This film is amazing . An amazing horror opera , in the UK we have a Circus by Dr Haze that does a tour called Circus of Horrors . This movie is so strange as it is so very similar to the Circus of Horrors show , and even the grave robber has a similar attitude to Dr Haze , the undead ringmaster of Circus of Horrors . I thought it was Dr Haze so much that I checked the corrects and was so surprised that it was n't actually Jon Haze . Simply amazing , some bits of the film have a similar story line to Bioshock where the grave robber is getting the chemical from the bodies , same way as the Big Daddy 's in Bioshock that harvest Eve from the bodies . It is strange to see this number of different shows all mixed into the movie , plus the opera side of it is really well done , it 's very dark , and modern opera which makes it really good . Very similar to Phantom of the Opera with some good songs in there . The songs sound really amazing if you are watching the show with a Dolby 5.1 surround sound set up as some parts of the music are overlaid and the different words that the different actors are singing can be very clearly heard with Dolby 5.1 , but without I presume it would sound very flat and mixed . I watched it on Blu-Ray playing through my PS3 , on my Pico Projector , with a Kenwood Dolby 5.1 surround sound set up and it sounded and looked superb . " ,8
" A cult movie in the making , so good !!! . This is one of the cheesiest films I have ever seen ! The basic story is that everyone 's organs are failing and there is an organization , GeneCo , which will give you new ones , but if you ca n't pay the fee , or fall behind on your payments , the repo man will come and take them back !! Another part of the story is that the repo-man has a daughter who has a blood disorder , and he resents her as when she was born her mother died due to a cure that he made for her . It stars Sarah Brightman as a singer who turns out to be the girl 's godmother . Oh and Paris Hilton as one of three siblings who want to take over the GeneCo company from their father . Add to all of this the fact that its a musical , and its extremely cheesy , but actually quite great Having not realized that Paris Hilton was in Repo , I watched completely unaware . This allowed me to view what is a very very good performance - not what you would expect from the spoiled brat , BUT that is n't the point at all . This is the musical that has brought a revolution to the genre - it draws on successful features of the arguably surreal Rocky Horror , and marries them with the increasingly popular Dystopian genre evidenced in Blade Runner , A Clockwork Orange and so many others . The harmonic layers are an aural masterpiece , each watching\/listening brings yet another layer , from the choral repetitions to the rhythmic dialogue all within the backdrop of a harmonious but varied musical score , running the gamut from modern rock through jazz and even Sarah Brightman 's stunning operatic style -LRB- rendered in Italian -RRB- . Though the film has an 18-rating , it is by no means terrifying nor foul , yes it does use vulgar language , but only occasionally , and usually for effect only . What sets it as potentially horrifying is the gratuitous blood and body-parts , though , due to the nature of the film , and the stylised choreography , these become scenic pieces which are nothing compared to the effects found in modern horror films such as the Saw series . Please , give this film it 's fair chance - it will change your world , for better or worse - do n't be put off by the rating , or the Saw linkages - this is an operatic performance for the modern age . Neither opera nor musical , this is a twenty-first century operata ! " ,10
" A unique take on the musical genre . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is not your usual movie-musical . Set in 2056 , there is a worldwide spread of organ failures and a company called GeneCo builds a business out of high priced organ transplants . When payments are missed , they send out the Repo Men to repossess the organs . The movie centers around Shilo , a teenage girl with a rare blood disease , as she looks for a cure . Repo ! is a dark twist on the classic musical . It is a visually stunning movie with a very catchy soundtrack . The cast was surprisingly talented as well . Alexa Vega plays Shilo , in a dramatic change from her former roles , with great success . Even Paris Hilton is interesting to watch in her familiar role of the spoiled , rich daughter . I definitely recommend Repo ! The Genetic Opera to fans of films like Rocky Horror Picture Show and Little Shop of Horrors . " ,7
" 1\/3 Awesome , 1\/3 Terrible , 1\/3 What the Hell Just Happened . In the not so distant future , massive organ failures cause society at large to collapse . As panic consumes the globe , Gene Co , and its founder Rotti Largo -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- , develop a cure : cheap organ transplants that stem the tides of death and anarchy . Surgery becomes a type of fashion . To accommodate this , organ repossessions become legal . Nathan Wallace -LRB- Anthony Head -RRB- is one such Repo Man . After his wife 's tragic death -LRB- for which he blames himself -RRB- , he grew overbearingly protective of his daughter Shilo -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- . Seventeen years later , Rotti is dying and none of his children -LRB- Paris Hilton , Bill Moseley , Nivek Ogre -RRB- are deemed fit to inherit Gene Co. . He sets his sights on Shilo as his new heir and all she has to do is kill the Repo Man . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is composed of equal parts awesome , terrible and what the Hell just happened , coalescing into a singularly unique and strangely compelling musical narrative . Some songs , particularly those pertaining to Shilo 's pubescent angst , may at first seem puerile and a-stylistic to older audiences . When the film is understood as the narrative descendant of Victor Hugo 's The Hunchback of Notre Dame , however , where the story does n't focus on any one individual but rather the entire host of characters surrounding the mega-conglomerate Gene Co , such seemingly childish songs -LRB- Seventeen \/ I 'm Infected by Your Genetics -RRB- may be understood as expressions of character just as necessary as the pragmatic Gold , the sanguine Thankless Job or the haunting Chase the Morning Light . The film 's songs , as well as their performance , as nothing short of exquisite . Paul Sorvino and Sarah Brightman add their experienced operatic voices to an otherwise less-classically trained cast . In particular , Gold and Chromaggia are brilliant showcases for their talents . Anthony Head adds a rough , unpolished quality to the soundtrack that adds a tasteful dissonance to Sorvino and Brightman 's own performances . In the vocality of the film , Alexa Vega plays the straight man . Her voice is n't as distinguished as any of her fellow actors , but blends seamlessly into any song which features her . Perhaps the pleasantest surprise of the film is Paris Hilton 's performance as Amber Sweet . She seems to appeal to the total audience of the film ; fans of Hilton will love seeing her while her detractors will love seeing her face fall off prior to the film 's emotive climax . The only real detraction to the film are their stylistic use of exposition -LRB- graphic panels with written text -RRB- . The expository text appears infinitesimally small on the screen and is passed by extremely quickly - in short , making it extremely difficult to read -RRB- . Additionally , any information that these expositive scenes portray are evident enough in the film -LRB- as they 're typically followed by songs which describe what they just revealed -RRB- . These scenes would better serve the film if they were cut out in their entirety or replaced with traditionally acted-out scenes -LRB- I 'm inclined to believe that the latter would be more than sufficient -RRB- . While it never comes close to ruining the cinematic experience , it does frustrate it considerably . Fans of dark musicals and portrayals of bleak , despondent -LRB- not quite post-apocalyptic -RRB- futures will find Repo ! The Genetic Opera an absolute gem of a film . With its brilliant acting and vocal ensemble , darkly off-beat writing and eccentric direction , this film is an experience that should not be missed . " ,8
" Very Good Movie ! . I was a bit skeptical at watching this at first , but after watching it I was amazed ! The movie is full of great voices , amazing acting , and has a well organized plot ! Almost all of the dialogue is in sing-song -LRB- singing -RRB- , and only a few lines are spoken in a regular dialogue-like voice . It is a bit weird in its own sense , but overall it 's a good movie , great for horror and potential sci-fi fans , and it does take place in a VERY close future , and is classified as a horror . I would recommend watching this movie , unless you have a weak stomach , as you get to see repo victums being cut open and see the organs up close . " ,8
" Amazing and memorable ! . The first time I saw the trailer of this movie I thought this is interesting . But when I got the opportunity to watch it . It blow my mind . Amazing visual FX , the cast is very cool and they characters are very memorable . Even I was impressed with Paris Hilton in this movies , because in some scenes her acting and singing look really nice done . I congratulate Twister Picture for this great effort that catch my attention with the amazing work of the costumer design and the set are Gothic and memorable . The music is fantastic , a mix of opera and rock that draw you into the dark and twister world of Repo . If you like Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and , then you going to love Repo ! The Genetic Opera ! " ,10
" A movie you 'll either hate or love . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is one of the more creative movies I 've seen in a long time . Imagine if you will a world where a worldwide epidemic of organ failures occurs and a company dedicated to giving people fresh organs for insanely high prices . And if you ca n't pay off your debts then a Repo Man will come and take the borrowed organs back , whether or not you 're still alive . A rather dark premise that manages to work rather well . This movie manages to combine humor , horror , and song in order to make a very creative and very enjoyable experience . Each of the characters have very different styles of singing and each song will leave a lasting impression on you -LRB- whether good or bad -RRB- . This is a movie you 'll either hate or love but I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys watching something different every now and then . " ,9
" It 's , The Rocky Horror Picture Show , meet 's , Sweeney Todd . Most musicals are happy and sometimes have some catchy song 's like , Hairspray . There 's also musicals that are sad and also have some catchy song 's like , Sweeney Todd . But there was one film that 's also a musical and similar to , The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Sweeney Todd . The film is called , Repo ! The Genetic Opera . The story is set in the future where people are dying from Organ Failure but a company known as , Gene Co. , help 's the people and replace 's them with new organs . But if they do n't pay for their new organ 's , Gene Co. . Sends out , The Repo Man , to kill them and give there new organs to Gene Co. . What make 's this film really great is that most of the song 's were catchy and the music is great . It has a nice setting similar to the sci-fi movie , Blade Runner . The cast was also good with Paul Sorvino as the antagonist and Spy Kid 's Alexa Vega as one of the main character 's of the film . The only problem 's I have with this film is that some of the song 's were n't that good and Paris Hilton did n't do a good job as her character . Repo ! The Genetic Opera , is a great musical with some nice song 's and interesting setting . " ,9
" A unique and fun Horror Musical ! . Repo ! The Genetic Opera 7\/31\/2010 Repo ! is a very unique film that almost never gets made . It is an attempt to recreate a movie experience in the same vein of the 70 's cult phenomenon The Rocky Horror Picture Show . Director Darren Lynn Bousman who created the Saw franchise really has puts his heart and soul into making Repo , but it is made for a very select audience . Repo ! takes place in a distant future where organ failure is a worldwide epidemic . The Geneco Corporation will provide you with the new parts and financing , but miss a payment and the Repo Man will come to collect . Earlier this year a very similar movie with Jude Law and Forest Whitaker called Repo Men was made with mixed results . Thank got it was n't a musical as well ; although it would be worth the price of admission to see Jude and Forest sing a duet . More than anything Repo ! seems to be a big exercise in style over substance , but saying that I have to admit I did buy the DVD . The storyline is pretty average and melodramatic . Being that it is a musical ; the songs are pretty good but not great . All the metal and modern rock songs do fit the movie well and compliment the films bleak and gory landscape . Now looking at the acting , I never thought I would say this until hell froze over , but with a cast that includes Paris Hilton , the acting was pretty good . Paris plays the surgery addicted daughter of Geneco 's president Rotti Largo , played by Paul Sorvino . Opera singer Sarah Brightman plays , wait for it , opera singer Blind Mag , in her first acting role . Horror genre favorite Bill Mosley is cast as one of Rotti 's son 's . Mosley is a character actor who is just about perfect in every role he plays from all the Rob Zombie films to the little independent movies . Repo ! is an interesting little experiment of a film and a good addition to your Netflix Queue . Also to set the record straight Repo ! is really no Rocky Horror . " ,8
" Shakespearean-styled goth musical with an original twist . Well , curiosity got the best of me . I had seen this DVD on shelves for a couple of years now , and I gave it a shot tonight . I am usually quick to hate on these types of trendy cult films that gain followings within the first month of its release , but I have to give it to the guys at Twisted Studios and Lionsgate . This was an entertaining , Shakespearean - style musical complete with the new addition of comic-book frames telling parts of the story along with a full , dark-themed scenery . \*\* Whoever downvotes this movie down to a 1-star rating is missing whatever sense of humor they thought they had . \*\* This movie is purely farce and full of black comedy woven into a scorned-love story complete with cheap gore and cheap songs . It 's an updated Rocky Horror Picture Show for fans of Rob Zombie 's \/ Marilyn Manson songs with a touch of Evanescence singing . The gore is not meant to disgust the audience nor shock them ; these are all nods towards stage plays where you know the props are not real . Although the effects used on Blind Mag 's R2D2-3D - projection eyes was a treat , and I thought all of the imagery had a very nice , stylish tone that really brought the audience into their world . Was the movie groomed to be a cult classic ? Who knows , but what was created is worthy of watching over every now and again for entertainment 's sake , and should be given a good chance amongst other cult classics . Why fight a good thing ? " ,7
" A fantastic gem - do n't overlook it . . The first time I saw this movie , I was looking for something offbeat on Netflix following a random ' 80 's B science fiction movie and I figured that something from 2008 should at least have modern special effects . I started streaming this movie while updating my website . Big mistake . About halfway through I started thinking it sounded interesting . I brought it to the front during the scene where Brightman is revealing herself to Vega , and the almost ethereal singing combined with the entrancing gaze as the recording streamed out of her eyes was just stunning . No , it was otherworldly . I let it play through to the end , mesmerized , then restarted the film and watched it again . Amazing . Obviously , I did n't catch the marketing of this film . Like Bubba Hotep , this movie passed me by as I was in grad school at the time and ignoring all else . Is the singing always spot-on ? No , I could hear Head 's voice hit the edge of its range several times , and the same for a couple other members of the cast . But that just made the film seem more ... plausible to me . The sheer hedonism on display by the family somehow brought to mind stories I 'd read of the hi-jinx of the sons of Saddam Hussein . The notion of addiction to surgery was at first puzzling , but then made sense -- a psychological addiction to re-arranging one 's anatomy , constantly chasing the grass on the other side of the fence , the ultimate expression of pathologically poor body image . The poisoning of Vega 's character brought to the forefront the cases of parents who do the same thing in the real world for the sake of attention and validation . Everything in this movie is a critique of society 's obsession with image , ego and self-centeredness . There is n't even much gratification reached by any of the characters . Amber 's stage show was a disaster , neither brother inherited control of the company , Rotti died without the heir he could be proud of , and Shiloh lost her father . And , apparently , during the credits the Graverobber ran out of zydrate . The whole dark comedy is indeed dark , and ends the only way it could : life goes on , somehow , in the big city even with all the secrets revealed and the tragedies fulfilled . When I look at Vega in this movie I see more of Tina Majorina 's Alice in Wonderland rather than her own Carmen Cortez . This is definitely one of those blatant coming-of-age stories . The movie reminded me of Tromeo Juliet , in superficial ways , such as the chorus provided by a musician , the sheltered daughter imprisoned by her father and the casual violence . But Repo ! is at the opposite end of the dark comedy spectrum with actual production values , oddly developed themes and in-your-face boldness . I have never had reason to ask what movie would unite Anthony Head and Paris Hilton . It 's not a question that crops up in casual conversation . But I am very glad to have found the answer . " ,9
" a musical for macabre . As a metal head i can honestly say that this film was great ! Great story , great music , great character development ! Yes the movie may start off a little bit rocky and boring , but by the end you 'll like it . The acting i felt went really well . Each actor portrayed their character really amazingly ! Even Paris Hilton did a good job ! then again her character is a druggie obsessed with plastic surgery , so it must have been not all that hard . Every cast member shines more importantly . The music ... WHERE DO I BEGIN ! AWESOME ! its not your typical Hairspray stuff at all . Quite the opposite . Awesome riffs compliment the actor 's singing voice , and every song has a form of punk or metal to it . Overall , see this movie if you like Gore , Metal Music , and\/or a good movies ! " ,7
" Haunting and brilliant . The first time I saw this movie was after a friend recommended it to me about 2 months after it came out . I tracked it down online and watched it in a crappy quality , and yet , the ending still did n't fail to shock me . Beautifully written , this story may not be for all , but is a masterpiece about the tyranny of today 's society and where we 're headed if we keep it up . Today 's society is desperate to perfect their looks , desperate for companionship and dangerously addicted to anything illegal . This movie delves into the extremes of this , where organ transplants are financial burdens , people living on the street are addicted to a rare drug , and where people are willing to drug others just to trap them in their own house for company . The singing may not be for everyone and a couple of the songs are indeed rough , but others , especially Blind Mag 's haunting Italian opera Cromaggia -LRB- played by Sarah Brightman -RRB- , are gorgeous . The casting is abnormal but still manages to work together to create this haunting story for the ages . " ,10
" I Loved it ! From the trailer alone ! . I saw the trailer for Repo ! and i HAD to see it . The musical incentives and the Gothic undertones and i was hooked . i 'm not completely Gothic or anything . i 'm just really open minded and i loved this movie . i 'm into musicals not completely but i have seen my share and this one was completely different . It was edgy and completely Gothic which i loved about it . i especially loved Blind Mag . i bought it before i ever watched it and i loved it . i even bought a ring tone -LRB- chase the morning -RRB- and some songs for my music library . it is a great movie and i do n't care what anyone says . IT 's GREAT ! I think everyone should watch it once , i mean its gory , kind of , but not too much . " ,10
" Repo ! just keeps on ticking ... . I wo n't lie - I have only seen this movie once , and that was over two weeks ago . And I am still falling asleep to the sound of ` Zydrate Anatomy ' or ` Legal Assassin ' in my head . THAT is how good this movie is . People have compared this film to Rocky Horror and I agree with them , in that viewing this film will be much more of an experience when set in front of a live audience . However , as far as I am concerned , that is where the comparison ends . Instead , think of it as something like The Crow , a starkly lit dystopia with elements of pop-culture influence . Repo ! The Genetic Opera is a truly original film which is equal parts sci-fi and realism . Come on , you 're telling me you can see a reflection of today 's drug culture in the wonder-drug Zydrate ? Or what about the idea of surgically-enhanced body parts being used as a fashion statement ? You see my point . Obviously this movie wo n't be for everyone -LRB- there 's no such thing as a movie which EVERYONE likes -RRB- . The people who WILL like it are those who love musicals -LRB- as there is not a spoken line in the entire movie -RRB- and those who have a substantial imagination . It 's also best to go in without preconceived ideas . Do n't go into it thinking it 's just for Goths or for sci-fi fans , because it is n't . Repo ! has somehow managed to find a market in that miscellaneous group of people who are n't conventional enough to be normal but have n't subscribed to any particular group or clique . In other words , a very , very large group of people . The acting is first-rate , especially given the film 's low-budget and it 's premise . Anthony Stewart Head finally breaks out of the stereotype he 's been lugging around since Buffy as the father of Shilo -LRB- Alexa Vega - probably best remembered for her role in Spy Kids -RRB- . Even Paris Hilton is believable in her role as a spoilt , bratty heiress . However it has to be said that the real show-stealer is the Graverobber -LRB- Terrance Zdunich -RRB- who acts as both a guide for the audience to the wacky world of Repo ! and performs his role as a humble robber of graves and dealer of drugs . Lyrical legitimacy is provided by Sarah Brightman in what is probably her most iconic role since Phantom of the Opera , and Paul Sorvino in the role of business tycoon Rotti Largo . The only criticism I have about the film would be that it is very plot-driven and you need to keep your attention focused most if not all the time . But I can only assume that this is because the film 's budget meant that any ` filler ' scenes had to be cut . Oh well , here 's hoping for a Director 's Cut ! " ,9
" Ultimately Original mixed with plot and awesomeness . Every now and then I stumble across a movie i obsess over until I can see it . I came across repo about a month before it was released and my city was n't on the release list . The nearest was Charlotte 3 hour drive away . I gave up and got it on bluray . As soon as I watched it . I was not disappointed . The Acting was great -LRB- Paris Hilton did pretty OK . -RRB- and I love Musicals but i love horror better , and all I had to rely on was Sweeney Todd which is great until you watch it a million times . but i would n't recommend this for everyone . It has its strange side only seen awesome by the strange themselves . So check it out if it sounds you . Trust me YOu wont be disappointed . Hopefully . " ,9
" Verdi , Wagner Mozart Would Have Never Seen It Coming . Back at the beginning of this decade , I -LRB- wrongly -RRB- predicted that John Cameron Mitchell 's ` Hedwig And The Angry Inch ' would be the Rocky Horror of the 21st century -LRB- and I 'm talking both the play , as well as the resulting film version -RRB- . Several years later , it never really happened . However , a feature film , which in itself was a result of a film short , ` Repo ! The Genetic Opera ' , has , in fact , become the next Rocky Horror . It started out as a ten minute short in 2006 , directed by Darren Lynn Bousman , director of such fare as ` Saw ' 2,3 the much awaited 4 , with a script by Darren Smith comic designer , Terrance Zdunich -LRB- who has a role as Grave Robber -RRB- . Two years later , Bousman , Smith Zdunich saw the open window of opportunity of creating an extended version of their short film -LRB- and dived in , head first -RRB- . The new feature film version starred Alexa Vega -LRB- of the Spy Kids films -RRB- , as Shilo Wallace , Paul Sorvino as Rotiti Largo , Anthony Head -LRB- which most know as Giles , from Buffy The Vampire Slayer -RRB- as Nathan\/Repo Man , pop singer , Sarah Brightman as Blind Mag , and yes ... even Paris Hilton ! , as Amber Sweet . The film plays as a sort of Industreal\/Punk\/Goth \/ Splatter Punk\/Cyber Punk , opera . The plot concerns a future dystopia , where black market organs are not only legal , but are overseen by a big company that deals in organ transplants -LRB- I wo n't spoil the fun in revealing just how the organs are harvested -RRB- . The ones who ca n't keep up payment are subjected to repossession of said such organs -LRB- graphically depicted on screen -RRB- . If you can imagine elements of ` Dark City ' , ` Rocky Horror ' just about any torture porn epic , with a Cyber Punk music score , you 've pretty much figured out ` Repo ! The Genetic Opera ' . Rated ` R ' by the MPAA , this film contains some pretty graphic , bloody violence , flashes of nudity , sexual content some raunchy language . Not a good choice for children , or close minded adults who 's musical tastes have n't advanced much beyond 1976 . " ,8
" Slightly higher mark for being refreshing and dark - hits harder than Sweeney Todd . I liked this movie because it was over the top goth\/glam with it 's costuming , fun with its gore , and the storyline was a good foil for all the characters to play off of . There 's lots of corny moments followed by gory moments followed by great singing and some so-so singing . The plot revolves around Shiloh , a little goth girl with a blood disease kept inside all the time by her father - they are connected to an evil megacorp called Geneco that repossesses organs and upgrades if they are not paid for . This is a nice darkly themed movie with goofy twisted characters . It 's campy and tongue in cheek and generally pretty fun . I never thought I would see a flick with Paris Hilton in it and like it . The main singing role goes to the blind singer Blind Mag ... who has some serious pipes - played by Opera Diva Sarah Brightman ! Lots of women with black lipstick singing opera revolving around a dark gory storyline . Twisted fun . " ,8
" Madcap but brilliant . I saw the 2008 remake , most notable for Anthony Stewart Head taking a starring role . It was made as a film in 2006 , being a film of a stage show . And most people have probably never heard of it in either incarnation . The brief background is that it is a musical set in a world where many people rely on artificially grown organs and life altering surgery , all of which belongs to a company called Geneco . All this high tech , life saving science comes at a price so Geneco offers finance deals on its procedures . But if you miss a payment then they can repossess whatever they gave you . Including your face , your heart , your lungs ... Repo ! The genetic opera is a sinister tale set in a madcap vision . It takes its style from a wide variety of places such as b-movie sci-fi , graphic novels -LRB- think Sin City or the darker Batman stuff -RRB- , horror movies , anything by Tim Burton and well , frankly the largest influence would seem to be The Rocky Horror Show . And much like that cult musical it is going to be a love it or hate it affair . Personally ? I thought it was bloody brilliant . The musical styling is a cross between heavy rock and classic showtunes , not always an easy mix but one that shines when it works . The music takes a while to settle into its stride but once it does its builds a tremendous atmosphere with a carnival of visual delights . The macabre world and a few scenes containing a fair bit of blood and body parts mean that this is no Disney affair and definitely not one for the kids . Its worth noting that the director of this version is best known for writing and directing Saw . I have yet to see the original film so I ca n't make any comparisons but if you like any of the influences that I mentioned above or fancy a musical like no other you 've ever seen then this is worth a shot . You may hate it but I guarantee you wo n't forget it ! Zen and the art of film review - found on blogger " ,8
" So close to perfection ; failed execution taints amazing concept and cast . . I would like to start with the things this movie did right . On the top , I would like to say that while this film is not completely original , it still attempted something never before done in cinema , or at least not done to this degree . This is very commendable in this era of mass-production Hollywood . Second , Anthony Stewart Head and Alexa Vega absolutely outshine their roles . They draw you so close to their respective characters ; you feel every pain , every hope , and every joy they attempt to convey . This talent is something rare in most cinema experiences , let alone one where the lines must be sung from beginning of the movie until curtain fall ! The problems with this film , however , really are so simple that it disgusts me . It 's completely stricken and overrun with superfluous scenes that do nothing but hurt the film . For failure of spoiling , it should suffice say that there are entire musical numbers that play no relevance to the storyline , and little shots of sexual gratuity that do nothing but make the film seem like cheap , second-rate production . I wo n't even get started on the numerous CGI works which seem created for the sole purpose of attempting to showcase the FX departments computer skill , or lack thereof . Overall , this film had the potential to be one of the greatest cult classics ever made , but I regret to inform that it falls ever so slightly short of its great potential . I am disappointed because it was not that this film and its director had too high of ambitions , but rather that this film was beleaguered with simple mistakes that could have been corrected with a more talented and choosy editor . Still , kudos where kudos go , this film manages to raise itself from most of the repetitive garbage produced these days and delivers a punctual and emotional finale that will leave you feeling oddly satisfied .

" Masterpiece . I was totally blown away by this movie , there is so much to love in here . you got absolutely great characters , a kick azz storyline . great music , A bio-tech company has been hailed as the savior to mankind by being the first to offer body parts to be widely available in the near future , you need a heart or a kidney , a bladder , eyes , , whatever , , you got it , , and you do n't need cash , , simple buy it on credit ... but buyer beware if you miss you 're payment . . the repo-man is sent out to repo you 're organ , no second chances , he rips the organ right out of you 're body . the repo-man is also leading a double life , , he is the father a young 17 year old girl who has a blood disease , she of course does n't know about her father 's double life , , the poor man 's wife died when she suddenly got sick so the father had to make the choice of which to keep alive ... enter Rotti Largo the head of Gene-Co . he battles with the Repo-Man after he decides not to reposses Blind Mag 's eyes , , apparently Blind Mag , and Marni , were best friends , , it 's a whirlwind tale of love , betrayal jealousy , murder , , all set to a mix of rock , and opera . this is truly a masterpiece .

" one of my all time favorites . This is one of those movies that sneaks up on you . I knew nothing about this movie when I went to see it . At first , I was n't sure how to take it , but the story actually moved me . The next day the songs were stuck in my head . I ended up buying the DVD and the CD . I guess I find it interesting that the people who dislike this film all seem to hate different things . One will say that the acting is terrible but the music is great . The next will say just the opposite . Since there is no accounting for taste , I 'd suggest looking at the numbers . Far more people have written positive reviews then panned it . Even my 15 month old son has his favorite music off of the film . I 've found him humming along with it . And I 'd like to point out the obvious : this is n't a musical ! Every time I read one of these guys complaining about them singing every line , I want to scream at my computer . IT 'S AN OPERA ! It 's right in the name ! To be honest , I did n't love every song the first time through . But once I had gone through the whole movie , those pieces fell into place . You can appreciate the themes , both as ideas and in the music . I 'd also like to point out that some of the critics are way over thinking this film . Someone tried to say that the main plot centered around who would inherit GeneCo . What nonsense . Central to the film is the relationships between each character . It 's the interactions that move the film along . Without it , there 'd be no story . It 's obvious that not everyone will like this movie . And that 's a shame . Still , I would point out that public response should be a clear indicator of how well received this movie is . If the whole world disagrees with you , maybe it 's not the world that 's wrong . There are movies that I do n't like , but that does n't mean that they 're bad movies for it . Maybe this is n't your thing , but there is no denying that this film has struck a cord with a lot of people and it will live on for that very reason . " ,9
" Bold and refreshing . I must admit , this movie had me interested as soon as I heard about the story , something different and unique . However , as soon as I heard Darren Lynn Bousman was directing I was deeply worried , as I absolutely hate the Saw series with a passion -LRB- personally , I think Saw II is one of the worst movies ever made -RRB- . But , surprisingly , he has done a fantastic job with this film and shown he can do more then just silly sequels . Repo ! is a breath of fresh air in the horror genre , with remakes -LRB- now called re-imaginings -RRB- and sequels flooding the cinemas and leaving nothing but pain . On the outside this does not look good , with Paris Hilton in the cast and From the director of Saw II plastered on the poster , but looks can be deceiving , and in this case they definitely are . I will not give too much of the plot away , as it is more fun to let it unravel in its odd way . Briefly though : the world is struck by an epidemic of organ failure but not to worry . Rotti Largo -LRB- Paul Sorvino -RRB- ha created GeneCo , a company that provides people with replacement organs and bodily needs . There is a catch , if they do not pay their debt on time , Largo sends a Repo Man to collect their property . A mix of horror , sci-fi and rock opera , Repo ! is a movie which will divide its audience into love it or hate it . I loved it , although it is not a perfect film , it is fun and very well-made . The cast are unanimously good , including Paris , who does a good job with a fairly minor role . Anthony Stewart Head and Paul Sorvino are especially excellent . The rest of the cast , including cult horror star Bill Moseley , did fine jobs with smaller roles . The story is told through singing and comic strips so it never gets boring , furthermore , the visuals are trippy and suit the outlandish style of the film . What was truly great about Repo ! was the fact the camera managed to stay still for the majority of it , unlike all the Saw films . The MTV-style flashy editing was substituted for a much more watchable style which for me is a huge positive . This is one of those movies that starts unrecognised but by word of mouth slowly becomes a cult classic . It is an original piece of work with plenty of gore and a great story to boot ! Hopefully Bousman goes on to do bigger and better films , he has talent . 4\/5 " ,8
" Repo ! is just ... WOW !!! . I was n't able to see this movie until it came out on DVD but have watched it repeatedly since . I have told everyone that will listen to see it . From the very beginning Repo ! grabs your attention with its bold visual style . The world created by Terrence Zdunich and Darren Smith is a Gothic wonder . Darren Lynn Bousman did an amazing job bringing their vision to life . The music was memorable , and I occasionally find them running through my head at random moments . All the actors seemed to jump into their Repo ! personas with both feet . Even in the fantastical world they were set in I felt all the characters were believable . I was most impressed by the performance given by Anthony Stewart Head . His transition between Nathan Wallace and Repo was amazing . He was able to completely change the personality of his character from one line to the next . Even Paris Hilton was surprisingly good in this film , although I 'll admit her character was n't too far from her reality . I realize that with Repo ! you will , with few exceptions , either love it or hate it . I hope everyone will at least watch it and judge for themselves . " ,10
" Awesome fun ! . This movie is SO much fun ! On the surface it seems absurd -LRB- and it IS a bit -RRB- : sci-fi horror comic book opera co-starring Paris Hilton ... but it rocks !! I ca n't get the songs out of my head , and even ended up downloading the entire soundtrack . It 's visually stunning and grotesque at the same time . Fun and creepy , gory and funny , with catchy rockin ' songs . Very inventive and clever . I guarantee you 've seen nothing like this before ! I 'd say it 's equal parts Rocky Horror Picture Show Blade Runner a slasher pic a comic book . And yes , Paris Hilton is decent in it , well-cast . Put it in your Netflix queue and watch it with the volume way up ! " ,9
" Very Unique Rock Opera . I did n't really know what to expect going into this movie . I was completely blown away ! This is not a movie for everyone . It is very unique and the singing is much different from other musicals , but the voices are amazing , the story is very interesting , and as a rock opera ... well , it rocked ! I have heard a lot of people compare it to Rocky Horror Picture Show , but I would also relate it to phantom of the Opera and Sweeny Todd -LRB- more of the later -RRB- . This could have easily been a Tim Burton film . It seems like something he would do . I think Bousman did a great job with capturing the story and tone from the stage play . I have been a fan of SAW -LRB- which Bousman directed -RRB- since it started and this is a huge change from that . Though , there is plenty of gore . It is more stage-like and almost amusing at times . A great Sci-Fi\/Horror\/even a little Comedy for anyone into those genres . " ,9
" This Film is Everything it Promises to Be . Repo is the story , told through song , of GeneCo -- a company that offers organs for transplant , but takes them back when payments are n't made . We also have the interconnected story of Shilo -LRB- Alexa Vega -RRB- , the daughter of one of the repo men and curious explorer into this strange new world , having been locked up for many years due to a genetic blood disease . I was blown away by this movie . Alexa Vega carries the picture alongside Anthony Stewart Head . Together , these two bring a full force of singing and acting that has n't been seen since Buffy 's Once More With Feeling -LRB- and watch together , these make a great double feature -RRB- . Paul Sorvino , Paris Hilton and Bill Moseley sing , as well , with musical guests Ogre -LRB- of Skinny Puppy -RRB- , Sarah Brightman and Joan Jett . The music is both intense and beautifully harmonic ... a good clash of harsh sounds and sweet voices that mirrors the world in which the story is set . Reviews were mixed on this film , some very positive and some quite negative . I fall into the positive camp , and wish I had caught this one in the theater . Lionsgate denied the film a full theatrical release , though I suspect it might not have done so well in the mainstream -- this is an instant cult classic . It was , however , showing at one of my favorite Chicago theaters and would have been well worth the drive . I can understand the negative feedback it received . Some songs are much stronger than others , and if you 're not in the right mood , it can be tedious and possibly confusing at first . Critics also tend to frown on elaborate dystopian future films , such as Waterworld or Demolition Man . Darren Lynn Bousman , known for his involvement in the Saw movies , really made a wise move to pick up this stage show and adapt it to film . While I have no doubt the stage production is excellent , there are many things in this story 's world that simply come across on film in ways that could n't be replicated live . If one has a chance to see this film , please do . It 's worth a rental , a purchase or a screening ... I see there being a late interest in this one and a much larger return to the stage in coming years , especially following the success of Sweeney Todd . " ,8
" Masterpiece . Until now there was only three musical movies I liked . Classical GREASE -LRB- I think it 's the movie almost everyone like -RRB- , then ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and the last TENACIOUS D - THE PICK OF DESTINY . I listen to metal music -LRB- specifically US POWER METAL -RRB- and as we all know , there is not so many movies with this kind of music ... unfortunately . So Tenacious D was my real winner , but now ... I have two ! REPO ! is amazing movie , nothing like I 've seen ever before ! I think it 's a real opera -LRB- almost every dialog is singed -RRB- first ten minutes I was thinking for myself `` this is probably not for me '' but later -LRB- in the 20th minute -RRB- when first real song appeared I have changed my mind . Rock songs -LRB- sometime with even metal points , many time during the movie I had the feeling I am listening to EVANESCENCE or NIGHTWISH -RRB- remains until the end one is better than the other . I can imagine to listen to the soundtrack . The main character REPO ! has great voice -LRB- he is probably famous -RRB- but I know him only from BUFFY , that 's all -LRB- sorry -RRB- The main character SHILO , is the same and everyone else is playing their roles very good ! Even Paris :--RRB- I liked the story , but I hope that nothing like this ever happen in our world ... god save us ! One thing may be minus for some people ... violence and morbidity ! Do n't take me wrong , I LOVE IT ! I love horror movies , the more blood the better ! The more zombies the better , more dead people the better movie for me ! HATE HAPPYENDINGS ! But I can understand , not everyone is like me ... I could see it with my own eyes ... I watched this movie three times in two days ! Fourth time it was with my girlfriend and she did n't like it ... simply because she ca n't see blood . Clossing comment . This movie will became one of the best -LRB- in musical -RRB- and when it comes to me ... I think , REPO ! THE GENETIC OPERA will really deserve it ! TRUE MASTERPIECE ! " ,10
" Really great adaptation - I hope you enjoy it too . . My daughter and I went to see this film last night with great anticipation as we have read the books . I know that the director is great having seen her previous work and I was looking forward to seeing how she and her co-writer had adapted the books for screen . First off it is based on the both ` Angus , Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging ' and ` it 's okay , I 'm wearing really big knickers ' there have been a few minor changes to make it work on film without Georgia sounding too whiny and to make the story flow better . It was a shame that we did n't get to meet Sven and his awesome flares , but he was there disco dancing in the background and Georgia fans will know him when they see him . From the moment it started we were engaged , the cinema was packed and during Georgia 's initial walk home we were howling with laughter and it just got better . -LRB- Did her feet move or did she glide ? -RRB- The audience was a mixed bunch , a majority of teenage girls , a sprinkling of boys and a few of us `` out of the stone age '' , I do n't think that anybody disliked it . It got major reactions from all of the audience each finding humor in different places . There were a few sad ahhh 's when there was a sad looking ` Dave the Laugh ' , some misty eyes during a serious dressing down and laughter at Mum ogling Jem - or was that just me ! anyhoo - both my daughter -LRB- 16 -RRB- and I -LRB- 38 -RRB- would pay to see it again . We highly recommend it but take a tissue with you , if not for the tears of laughter but for those misty eyes that may sneak up on you . It gives you a warm feeling to be reminded what romance and love is , both from a younger and older point of view . Although I did say to my daughter on the way home that you are not incomplete if you are do n't have a partner , but it can be a great feeling when you are ready . But Georgia is written with a boyfriend goal in mind . Look out Sex God Georgia has a plan ! " ,10
" An enjoyable comedy . As a fan of the books I was expecting a lot from ` Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging ' and although a lot of things from the books were included , a lot was changed or left out altogether , which at first I found slightly disappointing . Having separated the film from the books and viewing the film just as it is , I thought this was a solid romantic comedy about a fourteen year old girl -LRB- Georgia Nicholson -RRB- going through all the ups and downs of being a teenager - boys , kissing , friends , fall-outs , family problems etc. . The lead character was portrayed well by Georgia Groome , who showed Georgia 's many different sides from a self-obsessed drama queen to a caring and insightful young woman . Although the four young leads over acted at times , this helped to accentuate the drama of being a teenager . ` Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging ' is aimed in particular at 12-16 year olds -LRB- although it 's themes will appeal to females of all ages -RRB- . That 's not to say that males will not enjoy it , anyone who is or has been a fourteen year old can relate to the main character and her issues . There are some very cheesy moments , and if you do n't like clich d and ` disney ' type films then this is n't for you . However I think that for it 's genre , ` Angus , Thongs ... ' has just the right mix of romance , laughter and also some very touching scenes between Georgia and her parents . Overall ` Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging ' is a hilarious , light hearted film , which I thoroughly enjoyed ! " ,7
" I loved it ! . If you go into a film and expect something more often than not you end up not getting anything out of movie your going to see . I have read all of the Angus thongs books over and over again and i loved them . of course when i heard the movie was coming out i was over the moon . so on Saturday i dragged my mum out of the house for a girl afternoon of giggles . And that just what we got . the film was different to the books , but i think that movies appeal to a wider variety of people , even though it was different it was just as good.nit was full of girl humor and going back to first crushes and falling in love for the first time and all those cringe worthy moments , girls and women of all ages should love this film , its filled with laughs , embarrassment , and down right sweet moments . I give it two thumbs up ! I loved it !!!! " ,8
" Great movie . To be honest i thought that the movie was great , i have been a very big fan of Louise Rennison since i was in my mid teens and i love all her books . The movie entitled everything which the books stand for which is comedy , romance , teen drama and friendship . Do n't feel that with out reading the books you would not understand what the movie is about because everything is explained from the snogging scale to why slim is called slim . Although i feel that the movie is somewhat lacking when it comes to Georgia 's vocabulary because she uses terms which non book readers would understand . However if you are devoted to the books you wo n't hear such words staga 14 or mutti or fatti but just school , mom and dad . Which kind of leaves the die heart fan unsatisfied . The cast was well chosen and the story line did change a little bit when compared to the books but it still included all the important bits from the books and now i 'm hoping that their might be a sequel at some point in the future . Its worth watching . " ,9
" Smart funny look at growing up that gives hope to future of British cinema . Georgia Nicolson -LRB- Groome -RRB- finds her perception of life changes after making a fool of herself at a party . Now she plans to grow up and no sooner does Robbie -LRB- Johnson -RRB- come to her school , and Georgia instantly falls for him . After the disappointing adaptation of St Trinians and the decline of British cinema generally over recent years this adaptation appeared to be screened as a mere money making hour and a half entertainment rom-com flick . But thanks to some cheeky youthful performances , a witty script and an underlining message of coming of age , this adaptation of Louise Rennison 's best selling novel brings back that feeling of unashamedly British . In her first leading role Georgia Groome -LRB- London to Brighton -RRB- carries the film on a charismatic and charming persona that will have the teenage girls laughing their heads off . Her smart timing and in particular her reactions to situations create that comedy feeling that was an essential factor to making the narrative work . The film undoubtedly starts poorly . When Georgia turns up at a party , it is more than likely she will be an outcast and the fact that she gets embarrassed in front of her enemy and has to change her life is even more so . Nevertheless the comedic approach to the coming of age is likable and hardly clich d. There is some background to her motion to change and the way she looks at adulthood as a place of comfort is as likable as her cat . The changes she goes through are sweet and realistic given today 's modern outlook on the world . In this adaptation , we see many stereotypes and a very accurate look at teen language . The ` oh my god 's ' will have anyone laughing . The perception of girl 's views on boys is a stand out moment . The stereotypical representations are usually never right . Either they are extremely over exaggerated , for example in controversial drama Kidulthood or they are unnoticeable passive representations such as in St Trinians . The angle on the characters in this 2008 comedy feels right , not over the top with a good sense of purpose and an underlining message of coming of age . Though good fun , the plot wavers into clich at the end and does n't quite have enough punch to believe the arrival of British comedy is truly back . Having never read the book , I find myself considering after enjoying the good nature of this film . Critics have said the book is funnier , and considering the amount of laughs spilled during the film , it must be an option . " ,8
" Angus , Thongs and a Barrel of Laughs . I , just like many of the other people who have written comments , had read the Georgia Nicolson books from my early teens . When i heard of the film , i admit i was very excited . But i was worried that with the case with most book to films that it would be mutilated . Once IMDb has updated their information and said Gurinder Chadha was directing , it filled me with a little bit more hope . She had done some good films in the past , and i was hoping she would n't let us down . When i went to the cinema , i actually laughed out loud for the majority of the film . it was lovely to see the books brought to life , and so well . Georgia Groome -LRB- who played Georgia Nicolson -RRB- did an excellent job , i think they did very well on the casting . The only exception to this was Dave the laugh , he was n't what i imagined , but he was good enough . Overall i thought this film was really good , and Chadha did well on behalf of Louise Rennison ! " ,8
" Fabulous . This film is unexpectedly very funny . I was laughing awing the whole way through . A very down to earth , stereotypical 14 year old socialisation aspect and filled with comical funniness !! Not to mention Robbie is just beautiful and so sweet ! Id say its more of a younger teen film , having said that i am 20 years old and it warmed me to be familiar with them stressful teenage anxiety 's and first loves ! It is refreshing to see a British film that is good quality and could rival the usual American comedy romance malarkey . It actually portrays the daily life drama of the average 14 year old in a very funny and British way . Brilliant film , definitely recommend it ! " ,10
" This makes the teen generation look pretty stupid . . I am a fifteen year old girl and I loathed this film . The film begins with the main character , a teenage girl named Georgia -LRB- with the most annoying accent I have ever heard -RRB- , happily walking down the street dressed as an olive . She arrives at a fancy-dress party and has to face the terrible humiliation of being the only one dressed as a food . How will Georgia cope ? Will she do the most natural thing and take off the costume if she 's that embarrassed about it and have a fun evening with her friends ? No , of course not . That makes too much sense . What she DOES do is storm over to her friends , demand why they are n't wearing costumes like hers as they agreed , then deems their excuses as inadequate and runs out of the place , knocking over drinks and plates of biscuits and people along the way . She then goes running through the streets , still dressed as a stuffed olive . Actually , that scene is the film 's main highlight as it did almost change my look of disbelief to a weak smile for a second or two . After arriving home and throwing a full on tantrum which involves stomping on her costume , ripping photos off the walls and throwing all her teddy-bears onto the floor , Georgia takes a deep breath and announces to the family that she 's going to be ` more mature from now on ' . Well , she 's made a good start ! Drinks all around ! At school the next day , suddenly Georgia and her three school-mates are all best friends again . Obviously there was a major plot point when I was n't looking . And during their lunch break , they notice two new guys strolling through the grounds . And ` it 's boy-stalking time ! ' Yes , that 's their dialogue . Okay , maybe teenagers talked like that in 1886 , but come on , screenwriter . Get with the times . They stalk the poor boys through a montage , taking notes and spying on them through a pair of binoculars -LRB- and even breaking out into an utterly ridiculous dance routine at the end -RRB- . I half expected them to all tie their shoelaces every time the boys turned around . But this did n't happen , mainly because the boys did n't , not once , turn around , a fact that I find pretty amazing . How hard can four giggling-screeching-in-uniform-linking-arms-armed-with-binoculars schoolgirls be to spot ? And so , obviously , Georgia gets to know the guy she 's got her eye on -LRB- Robbie -RRB- and yes , obviously he already has a girlfriend . Georgia is heartbroken . I was mildly perturbed . I imagined what Georgia would tell the rest of her friends to be something like this : You know that handsome guy I talked to for eight seconds ? Well , he has a girlfriend ! I 've never felt so BETRAYED ! Anyway , Georgia tries to make him jealous by going out with another guy -LRB- screenwriter 's motto : ` originality is , like , so overrated ' -RRB- he finds out and makes her feel bad -LRB- oh , the twists and turns ! -RRB- etc , etc. . You know the drill . It 's only been done eight million times already . So , after a lot of boring events laced with clich s that are too tiresome to think about , let alone write down , Georgia and her bestie , Jaz , split up and throw catty insults at each other during a netball game , the grand , dramatic finale when Georgia stomps on Jaz 's foot . Oh , the horror . The second-last sequence in the movie is a bit of a mystery to me because at the start of the film , Georgia was unpopular in her school , but suddenly , her night-club is packed with what looks like the entire population of her state , everyone cheering and throwing confetti like she 's just handed out free flip-phones . And then Jaz comes up to her and hugs her as if nothing ever happened between them , forcing me to conclude that an entire chapter was cut out of the film for pace reasons . Either that , or I accidentally slept through it . Anyway , for reasons the film does n't care to share , Georgia is now officially a hero . I have heard of the term ` suspension of disbelief ' and actively engage in it with popcorn-fare such as the Indiana Jones films , and any line Orlando Bloom says , but this is going too far . Sorry movie , but no humans act like this . Not in any state , in any country , on any planet . I thereby conclude that ` Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging ' is the worst teenage film I have ever seen . Eye-clawingly bad . " ,1
" Fantastic . I 've been a huge fan of the books since they first came out . I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about how they would translate the humor of the books -LRB- most of which comes from Georgia 's internal dialogue -RRB- onto the big screen . I 've been disappointed by so many book to film adaptations that I went into the cinema with very low expectations . I was pleasantly surprised . The plot focuses on the story of the first two books in the Georgia Nicholson series . It opens with the infamous stuffed olive scene in which Georgia commits a major fancy dress faux pas and quickly flees the party , leaving a trail of bemused pensioners behind her as she runs through the streets of Eastbourne . The film included a number of scenes taken directly from the books , many of which were favorites of mine , and it was a pleasure to see my favorite characters brought to life on screen . My favorite line had to be `` Eastbourne : Often described as God 's waiting room . It 's where people go to die '' which sent my sister and I into fits of laughter -LRB- mostly due to the fact that we have a very grumpy relative who resides there -RRB- . There were a lot of fantastic one liners -LRB- `` Georgia , your legs look like big cheesy wotsits ! '' -RRB- and just the right amount of slapstick to make it one of the best teen films I 've seen in a while . Georgia Groome was fantastic . Casting the part of Georgia was always going to be hard but they made a very good choice - she was just the right mix of sulky insolence and innocent naivety to really pull the role off . My only complaint is that sometimes the dialogue seemed too obviously scripted and there were so many slangy terms in there , most taken from the books like snognosity and glaciosity , that look fantastic written down but when spoken out loud it becomes jarring and unrealistic . On the whole I loved it . It stayed as true to the books as possible and even the addition of new scenes were done in typical Georgia fashion . Truly one of the funniest films I 've seen this year . " ,9
" Disappointing , even with low expectations . . Now , when I first saw the trailer on TV , I kinda wanted to see it . I mean , I loved Bend it like Beckham and I figured it would be just as good . Then , a few days later , I read some bad reviews on it , saying that the lead girls acting was wooden and unbelievable . So then I decided I would pass , or at least wait until it came on TV . But my friends Bekah and Katie dragged me along today , and I got ta admit that I had pretty low expectations . Plus , tickets in Bluewater are 8 , which is bloody criminal . Now , the girls acting did n't bother me too much . Yes , her voice and unnecessary emphasis on every single word she said kind of irritated me , but I was n't too angry . And she could n't be blamed completely - a lot of the kids in the film were pretty terrible . What really annoyed me was the writing , for a couple of reasons . 1 - `` Oh my God , I 'm having a nervy B '' , `` I 'm not going to your poxy party ! '' , `` Girls , time to go boy-stalking ! '' . I know these girls are supposed to be 14\/15 , but seriously ? I really hope no one watches this film and assumes that this is how young girls in England speak , and I certainly hope that they do n't assume this is how they act . 2 - Boy meets girl , awww they 're getting together , OH NO SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED , oh , phew ! It 's all better now . It 's an overdone storyline , and sometimes it can be done with panache -LRB- think : 10 Things I Hate About You -RRB- , but the storyline was painfully predictable . Overall , I felt that apart from watching a fat lady trip over a step on my way out , the film disappointed me greatly . And that 's with my low expectations . " ,2
" We love Georgia . I went to see the preview of this film two days ago near my home in London . I am a HUGE fan of the books and have read every single one at least three times ! Needless to say I was slightly skeptical when I heard they were making a movie , as I thought it would be really hard to live up to the books . The movie turned out to be funny and romantic , and left me with that `` feel-good feeling '' afterwards . However I have NEVER seen a film so cheesy in all my days ! I do n't think my friends and I have ever cringed so much - I turned away at so many points I was almost on my friends seat . For those who love a good romantic comedy this film is definitely for you . The main changes between the book the film : 1 -RRB- The character of Ellen is now an Indian girl called Namita 2 -RRB- The film is based on the first TWO books , but Dave the Laugh appears too early on . 3 -RRB- Robbie does n't write Georgia a latter thus introducing her to Dave , and they do n't go on to date as in the books 4 -RRB- The actress who plays Jas does n't have an `` annoying fringe '' at any part during the movie 5 -RRB- Georgia dyes a blonde streak in her hair which comes off in her hand -LRB- this actually happens in book 5 - hence the title -RRB- 6 -RRB- The order of events is muddled However , the film is merely BASED on the books , so there is an additional storyline . I will , or course , leave that for you to see . This really is a fabulous British comedy , with an ingenious , albeit extremely cringe-worthy , plot . But I must admit that really adds to the fun of the movie . The character Libby , and angus the cat are particularly funny . All those who are loyal to the book may come away feeling the films did not do it justice , but it must be remembered that the film was not intending to act out the book page for page , and Louise Rennison herself helped to write the script with this in mind . With great music and young talent I would recommend viewing as a nice summer film when it is released in July . Plus , Robbie and Dave the laugh are soooo scrummy we spent the whole film trying our best not to drool . Mmmmmmm :-RRB- " ,7
" Age-appropriate light-hearted fun . Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging is like a teen romantic comedy , but it 's better than its contemporaries . We have a group of 14 year-old girls , mainly focused on Georgia -LRB- Georgia Groome -RRB- , who try to find romance , learn how to kiss , and just go through the ups and downs of life as all teenagers do . It 's mostly done with comedy , and some light-hearted ` real-life ' moments . I find it is one of the better looks at teen girls while remaining cute and funny . I am older than its target audience , and while it 's perfectly suited for its audience of teen and pre-teen girls , I was able to look back with amusement on all their trials of love . I am relieved that we have a teen comedy that does n't go for a more mature audience and does n't show the girls as more mature than they actually are . Finally with Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging we have an age-appropriate romantic comedy filled with light-hearted fun . " ,7
" Let this delightful film touch your heart . This film is about a teenage girl facing problems with all aspects of her life , namely school , home and love . The title Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging made me lost as to what I should expect , but the director is a quality assurance so I watched it . Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging is actually a heartwarming , touching and funny comedy about a girl growing up and discovering herself . It seems like a simple tale about a girl coming of age , but it is actually a touching tale about friendship , family and accepting oneself for who you are . The leads are played by unknown actors and actresses , but they are all perfectly natural in their roles . It feels like am really watching a teenage girl 's life as a bystander , not a film . I am truly touched by the amazing ending . I enjoyed watching Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging a lot . It deserves to be watched by a wider audience . Let it touch your heart . " ,8
" Maybe it 's more of a -LRB- very strange -RRB- girl 's film . . \* SPOILERS \* . The saga of Georgia Nicolson is one most likely to be appreciated by a teenage girl between the ages of 12 and 16 . I watched hoping for some good drama and comedy , but left disappointed by the lack of depth in the characters and the coarseness of the jokes . Also , the love interests for Georgia and her best mate Jas are personality-less pretty boys without an ounce of charisma , which makes you wonder why they are pursued with such ferocity by our big-nosed heroine and her blonde friend . Ooh , one works in an organic fruit shop and the other in the lead singer in a band . Talk about too perfect . Plus can we have a film where the parents are n't a down-with-it mum and a dopey dad ? Hearing Mrs Nicolson describing schoolboys as ` fitties ' and lusting after a shirtless builder about 20 years her junior might be embarrassing , but it is n't especially funny . And the less said about Alan Davies 's confusion over how many pairs of brown trousers to take to work abroad with him , and his bad dancing at his daughter 's birthday disco -LRB- more on that farce later . . -RRB- , the better . In fact , there are so many weird 'n' wacky individuals in this film there 's hardly any room for normality at all , and I genuinely feel sorry for any female who can relate to it . Taking a cat for a walk on a lead ? Applying moisture to turn your legs yellow before going swimming ?! Going to a snog specialist 's house to learn how to kiss a boy , who is so popular he has to squeeze you into a 30 minute session ??! Yeah , right . This seriously harms the credibility of the film when there are so many surreal elements , which constantly take you out of the action and leave you scratching your head and saying out loud : HUH ?! PEOPLE DO N'T BEHAVE LIKE THAT !! Balanced alongside the more tender , soap opera-ish moments the formula does n't match up , and you 're left with a bit of a mess . The ending deserves a paragraph all to itself . Only a scriptwriter could construct something as ridiculous as this : In the space of five minutes in a ` surprise party ' every problem is solved : All relationships are reconciled , an unwanted move to New Zealand is canceled when her father gets a promotion at home , The nasty girl is humiliated on stage when her boob padding is removed by Jas , and Georgia gets a song dedicated to her by her new beau on the main stage . Oh bless ! Even Georgina 's other nerdy girlfriends get introduced to more vapid pretty boys so they can have equally vapid pretty babies when they grow up . One problem : this is the most phony , contrived , unrealistic conclusion to a movie I have seen for ages . I know they want to end on a happy note , but this definitely overdoing it . By a LLOONNGG way . Oh and Georgie : your new song is pure , unadulterated sh \*\* e. And your dreamboat is obviously miming . Sorry , luv . Perhaps I 'm disappointed that I disagree with the main theme of the film so much : that getting a boyfriend is the be and end-all when you 're 14 . When I was her age , I was more bothered about what was on TV and my homework to bother with the opposite sex . In this movie however , Nearly every action and thought the heroine has is to manipulate the tedious hunk to being her squeeze . This is even before she 's even spoken to him : one flash of those baby blues and she 's all OMG I MUST AVE IM !! How about actually erm . . finding out if he 's a good person , or discovering if you 've got similar interests ? Pretending you 've lost your pet so he can help you look for it , or suddenly discovering a passion for hated veg just to get him into bed wo n't work in the long term of a partnership . Well , I suppose it does in the film , but that 's because the object her affection is as dumb as a rock . You can only put up a front for so long . . Phew , I said enough . I set out to write a quick article and ended up with possibly my longest review ever . Typical . But it had to be said . Watch lovers of the book mark this way down . Do I care ? Not a jot . Fire away , you know I am right ;-RRB- ... 4\/10 " ,4
" Good as a movie , bad as a movie version of the books . . I must say first that I did really like this movie . Im from the United States and this movie was hard for me to see . I waited months and months waiting for it to come out . I was doubting that it would be better than average , but still i thought it would be fun to see the Georgia Nicholson books on screen . I loved the books even though they were centered in England and thus not as easy to relate to the characters . I finally found the movie on youtube where i sat at the computer for an hour and a half . I felt I did n't waste my time . I really enjoyed the movie although it really did n't live up to the expectations of the book . For one the lack of the real sauciness Georgia had in the book . That character was really toned down which was a disappointment as i found her basic view on life in the books refreshing . Second i was slightly concerned on the fact that Georgia 's school was not an all girl 's school , and they did n't wear berets . Then i was even more disappointed in the character Jas . She was really funny in the books especially when her and Georgia would get into fights , and in the movie she really was just a good best friend . The character of Robbie and Tom were really right on the dot for me , exactly how i imagined them . Ellen although also toned down for the screen was actually really well done . I was disappointed that the Ace-gang was missing Mabs and Jools it was probably the right choice not to include them as I 'm sure the non-book readers would get confused . My main disappointment was the character of Dave the Laugh . Dave is my personal favorite character in the books and although they did a brilliant job of casting him , his character was really weak . They made him look like a complete idiot , bluthering at Georgia 's feet like that ! What about the part where they were friends ? Best friends ? Why did n't he call her Kittycat , his nickname for her in the book . He was n't Robbie 's friend at all , he was Georgia 's and he looked pretty sad , like he could n't find a date of his own , so he got all of Robbie 's rejects ? Another is that Georgia gave him the cheek . The kissed A lot in the books , even when both Georgia and Dave were seeing other people . Although i was disappointed in it as being based on the book , i really enjoyed it just as a movie . Overall it was funny and entertaining and i enjoyed it . I would advised anyone from the ages of 9-15 to see it . If you 're older than that you will probably be bored and any younger and i do n't think it is really appropriate . I hope you enjoy -LRB- ed -RRB- the movie . " ,9
" A real funny teenage treat for real teenagers that is actually about teenagers . When it comes to teenage films , the only thing you should remember is Mean Girls , but before you check that movie out , you see this movie and check it out . The movie Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging is a original coming-of-age kind of teenage film ONLY for the teenagers and sometimes the parents will enjoy it as well . In director Gurinder Chadha 's adaptation of the two books , Angus , Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging and On the Bright Side , I 'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God , it tells such a wicked story of Georgia Nicolson -LRB- played brilliantly by Georgia Groome -RRB- , a 14-going-on-15 teenage rebel who wants the perfect boy , the perfect life and the perfect 15th birthday party of her life . But , as you can see , her life is so disconnected by her parents and her sister , but is rescued by her beloved cat , Angus and her pals in which she calls them the Ace Gang . That is until she crosses eyes on two twin brothers who just moved from London to Eastbourne because of their parents ' divorce . One is Robbie -LRB- Aaron Johnson -RRB- , who is musically gifted and is Georgia 's perfect target but he 's got a girlfriend named Slaggy Lindsay who wants nothing more but wearing thongs and fawning over Robbie and to keep Georgia away from him . There is much to talk about in this hilarious film , but I will not say anything else . The movie is not dirty -LRB- although you can see some shots of girls wearing thongs in a Nickelodeon movie that is rated PG-13 only -RRB- , but it is faithful to the books and it focuses in on Georgia 's life in the right direction . Once after you 'll see it , you will probably own it on DVD , like me . The breakthrough performances of Groome and Johnson are a dream team and therefore I must say , it is worth a ride . Try it . Like Georgia says at the very end of the film : Result ! . " ,8
" Dull , clich d and BORING . Okay , so I never read the books , so I was n't even willing to see Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging I had to be put through it at school instead . And I guess I did n't really have any idea what to expect from it , other that it was probably going to be some kind of sugar-coated , superficial teen flick . And that 's exactly what I got . I 'm a British teenage girl . I should have enjoyed this film , right ? Wrong , I certainly did n't . Of course , this is coming from the girl whose favorite films include The Dark Knight and Indiana Jones I 've never really liked teen movies all that much , but especially the totally brain-dead ones like this . I 'll try and give a small plot summary . From what I gathered , a group of fourteen-year-old girls -LRB- who , of course , think that their parents are mortifying and that they are all ugly ; I told you this film was clich d -RRB- fall head over heels in love with two boys from their school . They then hatch a ridiculous plan to try and win them over , featuring cats and all sorts . And , of course , things do n't go according to plan . However -LRB- and luckily for me -RRB- , that 's how far we got and believe me , I 'm in no hurry to ever find out what happens . I 'm going to stay as far away from this film as possible in the future , and I highly recommend that everyone else do the same . " ,2
" was good . . I went to see this with a group of friends , two of whom had read the books and loved them and the rest of us who had n't even heard of the books until the movie came out . tbh , at first i did n't really think the movie was that good , i liked the storyline and everything but I thought the acting was pretty poor . However , having read the books after seeing the movie I have changed my mind , the ` ace gang ' -LRB- although not the best actresses -RRB- , especially Georgia are portrayed perfectly . I would like to have seen more of Libby 's craziness Angus though , because the movie is called ` Angus , Thongs Perfect Snogging ' , I would 've liked to have seen more of Angus . Having said this I would actually recommend the movie , its light quite funny , I will get it on DVD when it came out . " ,7
" A Good Teen Chick Flick . . Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging . I would give it a 7\/10 . It was a good teen chick flick . I would n't see it if you were a guy , and I probably would n't see it if you were a dad of a teenage daughter . And i probably would n't see it with your teenage daughter . You could find yourself ... blushing , or , perhaps a tad embarrassed . No doubt , she will enjoy it . It really does reflect a teenagers life -LRB- both male and female -RRB- . It shows the struggles of boys , boy troubles , and the fact that `` men are from mars '' . A fun movie to watch , if your a teenage girl , with your friends . You wo n't be disappointed . Some clich moments , but a good guide on what to do , and what not to do . Enjoy . " ,7
" Brilliant ! . I went to see this film with two girls aged twelve and an eighteen-year-old , and I 'm fifteen . We all enjoyed it a lot . There were funny parts -LRB- the fancy dress walk home -RRB- , `` Ahhww ! '' parts -LRB- Dave the Laugh -RRB- and cheesy parts -LRB- the ending in particular -RRB- . Everyone in the cinema , including the eighteen-year-old , was laughing . I could really see Georgia 's side of things as everything that happened has happened to me or a friend . The voice-over done by Georgia sounds a little overdone and wooden , but the acting seemed well done . The characters fitted the role perfectly , and there were quite a few good looking guys -LRB- Robbie in particular -RRB- . I did n't read the books , but have heard lots about it from friends so I knew it would be comical . Go to see it if you want a laugh , but do n't compare it to the books :-RRB- " ,9
" And who says girlfriends make you do feel embarrassed ? . Well considering this is my first review , mainly because of the review before mine was so unGodly biased . So what can I say . Note there will be some spoilers , and you will accept them if you read further than this point . So on to the main part . I was dragged into this film because my recent girlfriend made me promise to come and i really wanted to spend time with her . So I did not want to say or admit seeing the film , heck my answer to the cashier was `` A student ticket for what she said '' . The audience was all girls bar a grandfather and another guy who formed the other member of our group of four . The opening was alright , nothing was as hunorous as watching a girl walk down the highstreet followed by her father whilst dressed as a stuffed olive . Instant laughter , liked where this was going . Girls dressed quite slutty though jailbait , nothing bad here , might actually enjoy this . Girl running home to a weird family being laughed at by OAPs . The laughs are quite humorous . my most memorable part is how she turns down the resident man slut by stating she was a lesbian which was funny as it related to my girlfriend . However , there were downpoints , especially considering as I am a guy , the soppy will they wo n't they moments , which we know due to predictability was going to happen . And the final scenes with the party , for example , the boyfriend who owns the club was obvious . But still none the less enjoyable . Oh yes , the girls in their thongs also helped . Lol , I would recommend this . " ,9
" Terrible but hilarious to laugh AT . Right , I 've watched this film with my friends because it 's awful but at the same time we rip it apart because at the end of the day it 's so cringey and bad that it 's really really funny . . Why is it bad ? Well . 1 - It gives girls false hope ... No , being ` quirky ' and a total ` clutz ' does n't make the guys fancy you . Robbie -LRB- the Sex God -RRB- goes she 's just the perfect nutter ! But in reality , no one wants a perfect nutter . No one 's going to go AWW she fake tanned her legs and dressed up as an olive one time ! She 's so individual ! And there 's a difference between being quirky and being mildly retarded ... 2 - The culture of teenagers is dramatically unrealistic . At the end of the day , if you turned around to see 4 girls in a classroom doing a completely stupid dance in the center where everyone can see them , complete with finger spins and brushing their shoulders , they would get merked . On top of that , all the main friendship group seem to dress terribly . It 's as though an archetypal designer of Tammy Girls came along and dressed them all up in knitted pink tank tops or a purple t shirt with long white sleeves behind them . They looked like absolute dweebs . 3 - You sympathise with the main villain . Georgia , the irritating and unfashionable main character , steals the boyfriend from the main ` villain ' , Lindsay . Now Lindsay at the end storms onto stage and demands her boyfriend come back and everything , but is publicly humiliated when her chicken fillets are pulled out . Now , really ... ? Is this really a good message to send out ? Is it good to promote the idea that people with chicken fillets are pathetic and deserve to be teased for it ? At the end of the day , even the thought that you 'd lose your boyfriend to a whiny , less attractive and less socially aware girl with a severe deficiency in maturity , was probably enough to damage that poor girl 's self esteem , let alone the public removal of her chicken fillets . 4 - The acting was plastic . Robbie 's voice is so hilariously high , and it 's brilliant to laugh at . Jas speaks to Georgia as though they 've never really met before and that they 're on a set acting , which they are ... And Georgia emphasises every word in a nasal voice that will drive you insane . 5 - The dialogue is abysmal . This kind of crosses with the culture point I made , but it deserves a section all to itself . Teenagers do not speak like the characters in this film do ! They do n't ! No one states that someone is ` from Vulgaria ' . Nobody says snoggin ' and they definitely do not claim that they are a ` snoggin ' sensation ' . Jas delivers a cringe worthy string of phrases about the boy she likes , and whilst doing so makes a total tit out of herself : He has a fit bum ! QUALITY lushness . Oh I just want to go over there and snog his face off ! I know this ca n't be an accurate manner of speaking . Oh and Georgia delivers another line that will infuriate you : Remember . He 's from a broken home , so you have to be extra sensitive . Here she uses the implication that being with a divorced parent requires more sensitivity . I do n't really know if the writers were purposefully trying to make Georgia dislikeable ... So having moaned about the film -LRB- and believe me , I could 've written more -RRB- , it 's thoroughly entertaining if you 're watching it with like - minded friends who want nothing better than a good session of ripping it apart and laughing at the idea that some poorly delusional person wrote this fantastical fairytale between a ` sex god ' with a helium high voice and a moronic heroine who tries to find hope in her obnoxious and boring life that was once filled with My Little Ponies , listening to Scouting for Girls and concocting ` snogging scales ' . I think a sequel is necessary , where Georgia wakes up from her dream and tries to turn up at the door her boyfriend usually waits at , only to realize that the events over the past few days have been nothing but a dream . " ,8
" Read the book instead . I begun reading the Georgia Nicholson series when I was around 15 . When I heard there was a movie out I decided to check it out online since Singapore does n't show it . As the movie wore on I began to accept the idea that the story was rather different from the original . It does n't capture the sense of early teen immaturity that made the book so hilarious and lighthearted . It portrayed Georgia as a normal girl in terms on personality . Jas was NOTHING like I imagined to be ; a rather blank girl with an obsession with her fringe and the environment . The characters disappointed me greatly . From the main characters all the way to Dave the laugh . The result of the show was mortifying . Georgia 's parents would have never thrown such a big party plus she would have died in their presence . Wet Lindsay was suppose to be an anorexia twit with a large forehead . Immense disappointment for me . I 'd rather read the book . " ,4
" \* SPOILERS \* A Great Film that does n't deserve to be slagged off ! . As a reader of the books I could n't wait to see this film . HOWEVER , once I found out that they had changed Ellen 's race and made Robbie and Tom twins I realized that it 'd be a film loosely BASED on the books , and that 's what it was . It had the characters and some of the storyline , but also had it 's own storyline . It was a genuinely good and enjoyable film that is only being slagged off because people are expecting it to be EXACTLY like the book , which is ridiculous . If you are going to watch this film , watch it as a film and not as the book and I guarantee you will enjoy it . It 's a feel good film and I really enjoyed it and think if you go into a film which ridiculously high expectations then you obviously wo n't enjoy it . Bear that in mind when you watch this film . " ,10
" Fantastic , well worth watching . I have seen this movie twice now , and quite frankly it is amazing . The songs are very good . I found the acting OK for the first half an hour , but after that it got better and better . It is an amazing feel good movie and definitely worth watching . The movie has some similarities and differences to the book but on the whole it is excellent . I have read all the books but I went to see it with a friend who has not read any of them and we both found it excellent . It is the best movie that i as a teenager have ever seen . To summarise i would definitely recommend this to teenage girls -LRB- 13-18 -RRB- and maybe 11-12 year olds also , whether you have read the books or not makes no difference . It is definitely worth watching " ,10
" Well worth watching , think I 'll read the books now . When I went to watch this film I did n't go because I wanted to but because I was invited otherwise I admit looking at the adverts I would have not gone to see it . However this movie did end up putting a smile on my face and i 'm glad i watched it , many have disagreed and said there is no depth to the film but can you honestly say you walked in expecting an Oscar award winning masterpiece . -LRB- and do n't compare it to the dark knight either , there 's obviously going to be a big difference -RRB- Have an open mind it 's a fun film filled with cutesy cheesy goodness and we deserve a light hearted film once in a while . So go and see this film with friends as long as you do n't expect too much you 'll enjoy it . " ,8
" Enough to make any Rennison fan cry . This movie was a horrible adaption of Angus , Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging . It is the kind of film that absolutely destroys the idea the author of the original piece was trying to make . Georgia Nicolson is a silly , immature teenage girl who likes playing pranks and is absolutely boy crazy ! To sum it up , the plot is Georgia 's pursuit of a boy she calls The Sex God -LRB- aka Robbie -RRB- . In her attempts to make the handsome older boy fall in love with her , Georgia gets herself and her friends into zany situations . Despite her painful embarrassing family , crazy cat , and strict private school Georgia manages to come through on top , with her guy ! The problem with this movie is that it takes a hilariously silly , lighthearted book and tries to fit it into the normal template of a tween\/teen movie . They stuffed in too many clich s , made the audience sympathize with Georgia 's shallow complaints , and threw in some morals and maturity . The charm of the Georgia books are not only Rennison 's hilarity -LRB- which this movie got JUST a taste of -RRB- but the way she poked fun at how shallow and ridiculous Georgia was . It was always clear that the things Georgia thought were so important were ... just trivial , childish things . Because as many of us know , most things teenagers think are wildly important are ... not , and that 's quickly realized in a few years . But this movie makes it seem like every other stupid teen movie does -- that your desperate search for a boyfriend , and desire for a smaller nose and less embarrassing parents DO actually matter and ARE important . In fact . . this movie ended up being just what the books make fun of , shallow and stupid . It also destroyed the lighthearted , hilariosity of Georgia by making her mature in the end . That may be good for other characters , but the fun of Georgia is she stays completely silly and airheaded for years . For the most part , this movie destroyed the characters . This film took away everything that made Georgia special and original . It made her just another recycled teenaged girl character , which is truly disappointing . Her actions , which are supposed to be hilariously shallow and silly come out as whiny , bratty and annoyingly shallow , even manipulative . Georgia 's parents have lost almost all personality , except the fact that Georgia 's mom is flirtatious , which they push too far and make her flat out inappropriate . Dave the Laugh is NOT funny at all , and way too sensitive , when he is supposed to be an immature horndog . Angus also has no personality , little screen time , and is an ugly , gray Persian . Was it really that hard to find a large , orange tabby ? Especially when they gave him nothing to do in the film ? Jas was actually okay , but her chemistry with Georgia was not very good . The ONLY character that actually made me laugh and acted how I pictured was Libby , Georgia 's three year old sister . And she was only on screen for a few minutes ! I know I 'm comparing this to the book a lot , but that 's because it came from such fantastic material . But on its own ? This is just another dumb tween movie with a few chuckles . It might be likable for some young girls who have never read the books , but otherwise it 's forgettable . This is one of those films you should really just skip and read the book instead . " ,3
" A comedy with real teens , feels like a d j vu ! . My face hurts from smiling throughout this movie ! It was sweet and lovely and cute and funny , and it also had a few touching moments . It reminded me a bit of The Princess Diaries series -LRB- the books , not the movies -RRB- with a touch of British humor . If you 've ever been a 14-year old girl , do watch this ! First time I watched a teen-movie where the actors looked like teens and behaved like teens . Yes , their troubles are meaningless and foolish , but usually movies about teens have us believe adolescence is a road filled with drugs , alcohol and sex . Over-analyzing about boys is actually a more sincere picture of adolescence in my opinion . I loved the see you later discussion between Georgia and Jas : - Tom said see you later . - I know ! - What does that mean ? - I 'm not sure ... And so on . Hilarious . And the part where her father tells her she 's beautiful and she goes you have to say that 'cause you 're my dad . That totally happens ! The only thing that kinda let me down was the ending . It was exaggerated and too optimistic I guess . It lost that real feel the movie had until then ... I am looking forward to reading the books , I have the feeling they 'll be even better ... " ,7
" Improves on the book 's germ of an idea . Is there anyone more lovable acting asinine than Eleanor Tomlinson ? Jas , her character , lights up the screen thanks to the efforts of an actress doggedly fixated with the material . She may not descend from Beyond Bonkerdom or even the Valley of Thick within the strict rules of the Ace Gang 's legislation , but there is much to admire in a character who plays thick period , rather than just for the moment . I hope to see more of Tomlinson if director Gurinder `` Bend It Like Beckham '' Chadha receives the financial backing for a sequel . I want to spend more time in the company of these characters - I 'm almost demanding another movie given the fact this one never got a release in the United States . It 's the best film of its genre since 2005 's `` The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants '' because there is a caring attribute towards the characters , especially the leading quartet , and what pleasure it is to see the development of young girls growing , legitimately , into young women within such short boundaries .

" Angus , thongs and perfect snogging was clearly a fantastic movie with hints of cringiness . It is hilarious and very clever with many twists thrown in . . Angus , thongs and perfect snogging , adapted from the Confessions of Georgia Nicholson series . It is a combination of the first two books : Angus , thongs and full-frontal snogging and It 's OK , I 'm wearing really big knickers ! . I thought it was great how the used some of the funny events from the books , although there was some completely different things thrown in too . Robbie , -LRB- Aaron Johnson -RRB- clearly played the hottie in the film , who was oblivios to Georgia 's love towards him . Georgia , -LRB- Georgia Groome -RRB- plays the role of the very stubborn teenager with embarresing over-protective parents , a dog-like cat and a 3-year-old sister , Libby . Angus , thongs and perfect snogging is about a teenager girl who is busy coping with friends , family , school and of course boys . I thought it was a good film , not as good as the books though . I 'd highly recommend it to women in particular who enjoy a good laugh . " ,7
" A Nutshell Review : Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging . I guess Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging is the female equivalent of the teenage male sex comedies , without the sex or gratuitous nudity that is , because this is firmly in chick lit territory and based upon two books written by Louise Rennison - Angus , Thongs and Full - Frontal Snogging and On the Bright Side , I 'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God . If you may , this aligns itself more toward Sue Townsend 's Adrian Mole series , where we get a glimpse of the titular character 's daily life and anxieties through episodes of growing pains . Directed by Gurinder Chadha who brought us Bride Prejudice and Bend It Like Beckham , this movie centres upon 14 year old Georgia Nicholson -LRB- Georgia Groome -RRB- and her three girly pals whom Jas -LRB- Eleanor Tomlinson -RRB- is her best pal of the lot . Both have major infatuations with new boys in school Robbie -LRB- Aaron Johnson -RRB- and Tom -LRB- Sean Bourke -RRB- , and naturally jealousy ensues when Jas manages to hook up with Tom , but for Georgia , she 's stuck with having to battle for Robbie 's affections with rival Wet Lindsay -LRB- Kimberley Nixon , last seen in Wild Child -RRB- , who 's the school 's flower with cover girl looks . And while `` boylingual issues '' occupy the bulk of Georgia 's time , she also has major freak - outs with trying to figure how to throw the most memorable birthday party ever , as well as trying to save her own family from disintegrating , with Dad -LRB- Alan Davies -RRB- being sent to New Zealand because of a major promotion at work , and Mom -LRB- Karen Taylor -RRB- seems to be having a flirty good time with their home interior decorator . It 's quite a ditzy film and I guess for all the girls out there , the events as they unfold in the movie will probably be easily identifiable , and I guess the boys too will have a field day with some of the situational humor which came by the bucketloads . And what I thought to be really quite accurate , is the way how everyone second guesses each other when it comes to the affairs of the hearts , and sometimes dwell onto stuff a little too much to the extreme , incessantly finding meaning in something as simple as a word or phrase . This naturally brings out the ugliness that stem from desperation , and we observe how Georgia slowly degenerates from nice girl next door , to uber Ms Insensitive . It 's a fairly light and breezy chick flick that is peppered by some insane characters , such as Georgia 's sister who thinks that she 's a cat , and probably who I thought to be one of the most innovative fellas out there who would outplay , outlast and outwit the likes of Stifler and McLovin , is Peter Dyer , the self-professed expert who offers lessons and opportunity in allowing girls to experiment in achieving the perfect snog . Talk about being sly ! Ultimately , this is a feel good movie which has all its loose threads tied up very conveniently , which you could see coming from a mile away . But it does n't dwell on its problems for too long , because there 's always a solution that springs up for Georgia and gang to tap on . Peppered by some good music in the soundtrack , and generally likable characters who remind all of us of some dreaded issues when growing up , Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging is a surprisingly well designed teenage comedy that does n't have to rely on cheap gimmicks like incessant foul language , sex and nudity to draw the crowds . And for that quality , this is somewhat refreshing for comedies targeted at that demographics . I might go one step further and say I wo n't mind ploughing through the books as well ! " ,7
" Great for Teens ! . I have to agree with some of the other comments . You will enjoy in much more with reading the books . The books were great also . You get really stuck into them ! And want to read them right to the end . The film is great ! I love the actors which i think was great for their parts . Im not saying you wont enjoy it without reading the books , I 'm saying it will be more enjoyable . But you will love it anyway ! I recommend it to all teen girls . Ha-ha but I 'm going to make my boyfriend watch it with me as soon as its out on DVD ! This is great to see what happens in the end , let me tell you this , you do not expect it ! hehehe ! Good looking guys for the girls . Great film ! 10 out of 10 ! LOVE IT ! " ,10
" Brilliant . i give prior warning i am about to use very clich d words in the following comment :-RRB- Recently i saw this film with two of my girl mates -LRB- at first just to see a film and because Alan Davies is in it -RRB- but just as quick as i realized i was the only heterosexual man in the cinema , other than those forced to come by the 12a rating , i realized that the mediocre acting the cheesy slang and disgusting parents made this the most heart warming film i have seen since romeo + Juliet . The fact that the writing is n't the greatest along with the acting and the British sense of humor just added to the multiple reasons why i cant stop quoting it ! brilliant XXXX " ,10
" I Loved The Film . I Loved The Film And Thought It Was Really Funny . So , The Acting Was n't Great , But The Casting Was . I Had Read The Book And Georgia Nicholson Was Exactly How i had Imagined Her , And To Be Fair , The Film Is n't For Mature Adults To Compare Everything To The Extent That It 's Not Worth Watching The Film , It 's For Young Teenagers Who Want To Go Out With Their Friend And Watch A Funny Film . None Of The plot Would Actually Happen To Be Honest . The Main Girl And Her Friend Fancy Non-Identical Twins From Two Years Above Them , One Girl Manages To Get One Brother By Going Into His Mums Shop And Asking For Some Onions , And The Other Girl Steals The Other Boy From The ` Hottest ' And Most Popular Girl In School By Pretending She 'd Lost Her Cat -LRB- Who Is Really Ugly By The Way -RRB- . I Was Very Pleased By The Male Casting . Robbie , Tom And Dave Are All Really Hot =D I Would Definitely Recommend This Film To Any 12 + Year Old Girls And I Wanted To See It Again When It Had Finished =] " ,9
" Funniest film of the year . I went to see this film with 4 of my best friends and we all LOVED it . The film had the entire audience laughing all throughout the movie and it was the funniest film i have seen all year . However it is might not appeal to adults but the books were not written for adults they were intended for a teenage audience . The books are some of my favorite books and the film is definitely a brilliant version of the books , and girls if you are looking for a new boy to poster your walls with then look no further then this film as Aaron Johnson stars as Robbie or as nicknamed by the main character `` the sex god '' and Johnson truly lives up to that name in the film . So is your a boy or a girl and are a teenager\/young adult then i would definitely recommend this film but not if your an adult because you probably understand the comedy . As well as being funny there is a romantic side to the film . " ,9
" Well ... . As soon as i heard that they were bringing this film out i was expecting disappointment . I mainly agree with slyttle , who essentially slated it , because i have been a big fan of the series for a long time too . Where are the books we love ? She talked about the lack of acting skill - true , the lack of good direction - also true , and the shoddy dialogue - which i thought was `` meh '' . It 's meant to be a mish mash of Angus , thongs and It 's okay I 'm wearing really big knickers but it 's not . None of the characters were even slightly right . Jaz for example . Tom was not in the tiniest bit `` hot '' and in mine , and my mates ' opinions Dave the Laugh was actually fitter than Robbie . `` Wet Lindsey '' was altered to `` Slutty Lindsey '' and i unashamedly was waiting the entire movie to get a glimpse of Sven who is a main in the books but is mentioned once in the film and i do n't remember seeing him on screen . I do admit though that the soundtrack was not bad . In fact i might go as far as to say it was really good . I am essentially the key demographic and i disagree that it was completely without it 's merits though . Some people around me found it funny whilst i found it kind of clich and unstimulating . There was no mention of her idiolect -LRB- the way she speaks -RRB- such as Kiwi-a-go-go land and it 's like they just forgot that the books existed . Independently from the books -LRB- if I 'd never read them -RRB- I 'd say it 's just another shoddy English Comedy that needed to be slightly more real and slightly more thought over . The characters need to be jiggled and the script needs to be fiddled with if they expect to bring out a sequel . I think that they were trying ti make it too much like Bend It Like Beckham , when really the books have enough merit to make their own , even better film . I essentially got the disappointment that i expected . " ,3
" Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging . OK , So me and a group of mates went to watch this movie , and i found it actually very funny . The film catches the right amount of embarrassment that Georgia faces all the time . For me i laughed and cringed at all the intended places , and would actually be pleased if another movie was coming out some time later . Oh , and i have read this book , but it was like 4 years ago ... so maybe thats why it was n't such a disappointment 's to me , because i could n't remember what was actually in the book and what was being made up . So basically if you have n't read the book at all or in a very long time , then you 'll really enjoy watching it with a group of mates . " ,8
" Best Movie EVER !!!!!!!!!!!! . I absolutely love this movie ! It is my NEW favorite movie ! My favorite actor is Aaron Johnson . I just bought it because it looked interesting , and Blockbuster was going out so I got it cheap , and I am so happy that I got it . I have got the books now because of this movie . The actors and actresses were picked perfectly for this movie . It was the most cutest movie ever , and I love how it is British . I love British humor so much !!!! I love it how they talk about the parents the way they do . It really tells the truth if some teen walked in on their own parents who were kissing right in front of them . Me and my friends watched and I still laughed , even if it was my second time . " ,10
" Third rate teen comedy . Angus , Thongs and Perfect Snogging , an attempt to cash in on the quirky British teen book of the same name ... no wait ... that was called ` Angus , Thongs and Full-frontal Snogging ' , my mistake . I know , that name is just so darn raunchy . Anyhow , I saw nothing in the film which warrants a theatrical release . You 'll find nothing here that you would n't find on any other teen girl series on CBBC . You have the awkward 14 year-old girl Georgia and her quest to find the hottest guy evarrr in time for her birthday party , helped by her bratty friends . Dramatic stuff right ? I would n't say there 's anything necessarily wrong with this , I just do n't see why it needed to be released in theaters . By the end , I 'm like so what ? Even on it 's own level , everyone but pre-teen girls are going to be annoyed by the film and it 's stereotypical view of British adolescent life . Basically , the characters have their priorities all wrong and do n't learn a satisfactory lesson . This could be potentially harmful to it 's audience , much worse than any violence or bad language , in my opinion . That leads me to my other main problem with the film : it does n't know which tone it 's going for . Georgia describes the love interest as a sex God , a tad inappropriate considering that the furthest anyone gets is a good snog . If you had a film tackling issues of teen sexuality , that would be a film I would like to see . This is your average teeny girl nonsense which will be forgotten soon enough . I do n't recommend this to anyone but the target audience . If you are part of it , do n't make your parents watch it . " ,4
" Nicer than the book . When I found this film in DVD store , I was excited . I read the book like 3-4 years ago , and I liked it so much . It 's fresh , funny , and so teenager . And when I watched the film , I was n't really disappointed because I forgot most of the story and Aaron Johnson is so charming ! The story is about a 14 years old girl named Georgia Nicholson who feels that her life is not perfect . I confess , she 's a little bit annoying but I do n't really hate her . It 's normal for teenager in her age to feel upset about her life . She 's in this little teenager gang called Ace Crew , and she is a best friend of Jas . She then falls in love with Robbie , who later she called with her gang by Sex-God . With Jas falling in love with Robbie 's brother , Tom , they try to catch the boys to be their boyfriend . But it turns out that Georgia 's love story is not as perfect as Jas who later becomes Tom 's girlfriend , because Robbie has a girlfriend called Lindsey . Georgia then tries to attract Robbie , with help by Jas and his big fat cat , Angus . After watching the movie , I read the book . Then I found out that the film is based on the 2 novels wrapped in one movie -LRB- The first one is Angus , Thongs , and Full-Frontal Snogging and the sequel is It 's OK , I 'm Wearing a Really Big Knicker ! -RRB- . So , the movie is not exactly the same as the novels , some character are cut . You ca n't find Mark the Big Mouth and The another Ace Crew -LRB- I forget the name -RRB- . But you got ta see it , it 's hilarious ! " ,8
" This could be A lot lot lot worse . Im not going to lie , giving this a 4 might be over doing it a little , but given the source material and the rewrite that happened this is n't all that bad . Angus , Thongs and etc etc is charming at its high points and very very textbook at its low points , nothing is learned really , but given you are the right person , it should make you feel pretty good inside . A girl has a quirky family in the most challenging part of her life -LRB- as the movie would make it seem not being a girl I can not confirm or deny this -RRB- She notices all her flaws and neglects the flaws of those around her , including close friends , she is self absorbed like most teens are , she is just coming out of her shell trying to find a boyfriend while everyone else around her seems to be doing it with ease , being inexperienced in the art of snogging -LRB- kissing -RRB- to us Americans she dwells on finding out how to perfect the act , falls in -LRB- puppy -RRB- love with a boy and the movie is pretty textbook from there she does wacky things to get him , gets in fights with everyone from family members to friends along the way , blindly uses people to get what she wants only to realize the errors of her ways etc etc. ... like I said Cookie Cutter coming of age story from over the pond , -LRB- unless you are English -RRB- ... what saves it is that its seems pretty genuine when it comes to dialouge and the thought process of the girls , aside form the -LRB- purposely -RRB- over the top moments , which is always nice ... still 4\/10 " ,4
" Great Moviee =-RRB- . I Think This Movie Was Great At Parts It Was Really Funny Then Other Parts Serious And Its Nice To See A Girlish Movie MAde In Engliand Not USA For Once ! And Really Enjoyed The Book As well As The Movie It All Made Sense Unlike Some Movies That Just Make You Confused Its Completely Easy To Understand !! All The Acting Was Good Not Amazing But Quite Good ! I Think It Desverves A 8 And A Half Out Of 10 Because Of The Acting OF Some Of Them Most Of The Actors\/Actresses Were Good Though And To Be Honest I Cant Wait For It To COme Out On DVD Cos Ill Definitely Be Buying It Cos On the Big Screen It ROCKED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It Think The Movie Was Aged At Girls Around 12-16 Probably Id Definitely Recommend IT To A Friend ! " ,8
" Horrible movie . I just hate this movie . I 'm a teenager myself and this movie disgusted me . For one , the main character in the film , Georgia , was hideous looking . Oh my God i wanted to leave as soon as her face appeared . Now , now , before you go and reply back or whatever , hear me out , good god . Anyway , back to the movie itself . Her as a character is a completely different story . The way the characters put emphasis on their way of speaking made me just cringe , like i had to cover my ears it was so loud . The parenting was just disgusting . Like , in the end `` I 'm going to take you to your first night club ! '' as her mother said . WHAT THE HELL ?! She 's fourteen and SHES GOING TO A NIGHT CLUB ?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?! That 's just . OH my god . The story line is over used . Honestly , i think I 'm actually going to read the books so i could get the REAL story and not some Hollywood trash they brought out . This movie was rated PG when i went to see it , it should be PG 13 . Let me give you some examples `` LETS GO BOY STALKING ! '' `` Yeah , my mom could put a whole pencil case in her boobs . '' `` Well YOU DID ask what it was like being felt up ! '' `` OH my God , you 're like , going 7 on the scale already ?! '' -LRB- which basically means sex in what i heard from the movie . I do n't know -RRB- They put so much slang into their way of speaking , i should have brought a translator . Good Lord . I have so much more to say , but this movie 's so bad , i do n't think it 's even worth it . I 'd give it a ZERO , even a negative one if i could . This movie is worse than EPIC movie . Id rather see THAT than this pile of trash . Just do n't see it . Just do n't i beg you . I wasted my money . Also this is my first review ever . How lucky ! Expect plenty more from me in the near future . " ,1
" Great teen movie ... . I last saw Angus , Thongs And Perfect Snogging a few month 's ago , and thought it was a fantastic film . It is about a 14 year old girl called Georgia Nicholson . Georgia and her friends , Jas -LRB- Eleanor Tomlinson -RRB- , Ellen -LRB- Manjeeven Grewal -RRB- and Rosie -LRB- Georgia Henshaw -RRB- see two new brothers , that have just moved to Eastbourne from London . Their names are Robbie -LRB- Aaron Johnson -RRB- and Tom -LRB- Sean Bourke -RRB- . The girls follow the boys , Georgia falls in love with Robbie , but does not catch his attention as quick as she would like . Her friend Jas Starts to go out with Tom , what Georgia does not know is that Robbie is seeing her rival at school , Lindsay , who she hates . Also her dad goes off to New Zealand and he wants the whole family to go with him . She goes to the beach for a walk and finds Robbie there . Robbie tells her that he has dumped Lindsay and he says that he still likes her . Alought I think that this film is mainly for girls i do think that boys could still enjoy it . I think that all the actors in the film were great , Especially the actress that played Georgia . GREAT MOVIE !! " ,7

" The worst film I have ever seen . If a ` zero ' out of ten could be given , then it should only be reserved for this film only . This is truly the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life . If watching a countless young madams prancing around whimsically on screen , fresh out of acting school -LRB- and I mean fresh -RRB- , then this is your cup of tea . However since no-one likes that , then this film is not suited to anyone . Acting does not occur once in this film by the lead girls , their actions and their mannerisms are portrayed totally unrealistically ; for playing the roles 14 year old English school girls they did not act like this in any way at all . The picture house was packed with young girls , ranging from around 8-16 years old and none of the supposed ` funny ' parts of the film received any laughter . The film was very hard to like from the start , not being able to relate with the actors ' poor portrayal of the school-girl demographic -LRB- not because I 'm not a school-girl , but because they were such disastrous actresses -RRB- , the hypocrisy of the storyline itself , and a general dislike for most of the lead characters , meant that I did n't care what happened to them at all . Everyone loves a love-story , a sort of ` princess and the pauper ' , or in this case , ` maid and the prince ' . But when the lead actress , trying to woo this ` prince ' , lives on a quiet street in a seaside town , in a three story house , with wealthy parents and a scholarship at a grammar school , the story is meaningless . Its actually the princess and the prince . Who cares if little miss moneybags does n't get her boy , she still has her thousands of pounds , her family and friends and her otherwise amazing life -LRB- the boy who , by the way , is referred to as a ` sex-god ' , and is also 16 years old , two years older than her . -RRB- The film confuses its morals , and does n't know what it 's trying to preach to its audience , and as its audience is school girls , this is a little worrying . You should be yourself ? Love your friends ? Value your family ? Enjoy being intimate with older boys ?! The climax to this 1h 50m slow motion car-crash is a large birthday party held for the lead girl , and I 'm talking large . A sort of ` my super sweet 16 ' kind of thing , but she 's 15 . If you already did n't like her character enough , this was the final nail in the coffin . The lead girl did n't travel anywhere throughout the film , she was wealthy and unlike the majority of all 14 year old schoolgirls at the start , and she was wealthy and unlike the majority of all 14 year old schoolgirls at the finish . The film was truly awful , even the film music was poor , arriving suddenly and impromptu , thoroughly curdling the already thick cheese that this film was . You know you 're watching a bad film when a cinema room filled with the film 's key audience , young girls , is deathly silent throughout what was meant to be some sort of modern girly coming of age comedy , and the only laugh you get is when a Steve Jones makes an almost cameo-like appearance , and turns out to be a homosexual , which for every one who watched the film who was over 16 had already guessed . 4.10 was wasted , and so were about 2 hours of my life which I will never get back . The film was so bad it made me angry . This was not entertainment on any level , and should have been a straight to TV movie , straight to Nickleodeon . It was deserving of going straight to VHS . And yes , I am aware VHS tapes are n't made anymore that is why . Avoid this film , and definitely do not confuse\/upset your children with it . " ,1
" Amazing . Me And Best Friend Went to see this and we thought it was amazing i loved every minute of it i could sit over again and watch it it just shows what a teenage girls 's life is about.The film had sum incredible actors\/actresses especially Aaron Johnson Who Plays Robbie Who is kinda Fit Anyway ! I Would Recommend This film for girls especially and the teenagers :D Really Girly Film :D :D . Even If You Are Going With Your Boyfriend\/Girlfriend Once You have watched this together You will probably realize how much you actually like each other !! It Is really A great Film This is one of the best films i have seen In time . It is defiantly one to watch this summer !! " ,10
" The worst teenage film ever created . . This movie gives teenagers and pre-teens a bad name , we are not all giggly little school girls who prance around and act all ` grown up ' Its so childish , and is a complete and utter embarrassment . Throughout the film I was cringing in my seat and praying for it to end . Various films like ` mean girls ' and ` cluless ' were genius and I felt ` Angus thongs and perfect snogging ' was n't up to that level at all . Georgia is portrayed as a little brat , and each character has no depth whatsoever , who cares what happens ! The acting was awful , they simply could n't , and compared to ` bend it like beckham , also directed by Gurinder Chadha this is an utter failure . Keira knightly was brilliant and so was Parminder Nagra , but in this film there seems to be no talent whatsoever . Overall i was very disappointed and compared to the books there seemed no connection between them at all , save your money and your time , and watch dark night it ` mazin :D " ,1
" It 's just terrible . I went to see this movie with two girl-friends and a gay boy-friend - all three of us girls have known and loved the books for years , and the boy likes silly teen comedies like us . Although I adore the books , I did n't have very high expectations going in to this . I expected a decent movie , an okay one . This is n't okay or decent . It 's just awful . None of the lead girls can act and they over-enunciate EVERYTHING -LRB- imagine a movie cast entirely with the Harry Potter series ' Emma Watson , only NOT AS GOOD , and you have an idea of this movie 's young female cast -RRB- everything good about the source material is changed , and most of what happens in the movie did n't happen in the books . The screen I was in was full of the key demographic for this movie , and yet nobody laughed . I heard much shuffling , sighing and groaning ; and my lovely male friend was writhing in his seat , it was so terrible . The casting is this movie 's first major problem , and the writing is the second . Nothing of what makes the book funny or its characters charming is in here . The events are all jumbled around distractingly , and the girls act like idiots . Everyone looks too young -LRB- come on , Ellen looks about eight years old -RRB- . It 's not coherent , and the made-up-for-the-movie plot about Georgia 's birthday party is stupid . All the characters are unsympathetically written so you do n't care about any of them . The only character that solicited anything from the audience is treated like a piece of dirt by Georgia , who does nothing but cry and whine throughout the whole bloody debacle . Characters are completely changed from their book counterparts - look out for Wet Lindsay especially - and the direction is dire . Lastly , the message of the film is repulsive . Once she gets a boyfriend , Georgia sees herself as `` perfect '' - because he tells her she is so ! Georgia does n't become a strong person on her own , she needs a man to tell her she is so . This is definitely a stinker , and one to be avoided at all costs . It 's cheesy to the point of embarrassment , the dialogue is stupid , nobody has any chemistry , the soundtrack is terrible and it bears no resemblance to the original books . We were tempted to walk out . " ,1
" A bad film , but at its best slightly below average . . I watched this film after losing a bet with my fiend over who would win in a football match -LRB- log story -RRB- . Anyway , I could have been one of the only hetro sexual male at that theater , so I sat at the back . So about 30 - 35 mins into the film I thought , screw this , because the Dark Knight was on at this time , I had a much better 30 mins in the Dark Knight than this . So I 'm soy if you enjoyed this movie , but it 's just not me . For 30 mins , the acting was below average , the lines were below average and the cast was below average , so it gets a 3\/10 for being able to keep me in for 30 mins . Men -LRB- and woman -RRB- do n't waste your time with this , watch the Dark Knight instead . 3\/10 " ,3
" Rocket ... Yeah ! . This is one weird movie . I guess the best way to describe this would be sort of a Thai version of Robin Hood in which the hero -LRB- Dan Chupong -RRB- uses rockets instead of arrows . And boy does this guy have some rockets ! He has a ton of little rockets that he shoots at the bad guys and then there 's the bad boy that he can ride like a surfboard ! I 'm definitely going to Thailand for my fireworks this year . And apparently he has flint in his fingertips to light these rockets . That 's probably good because you really do n't want to be wasting time fumbling around with matches when you are single handedly taking out a large group of cattle rustlers . This is one really weird movie that also features a man who can change from a goofy guy with hair that resembles a tidal wave to an older warrior guy who can fight with the best of them . There is also a wizard , at least I think that 's what he was supposed to be , a tractor , talk of menstrual blood , and guys who seem to be possessed by spirits of animals that run like monkeys and can jump about fifty feet . Did I mention the hero rides a rocket ? As for the fight scenes , since this is really what it 's all about , they are mostly average . Dan Chupong is good , check out the much better `` Born To Fight '' , but he does n't have very many moves . He can do some Tony Jaa-like kicks and flying knees but they do n't have quite the same ring to them as Jaa 's . And the director of this movie really loves to show guys getting hit and then spinning in the air about ten times before hitting the ground . That 's all good once in awhile but it gets old after about the fifth time . There is a couple of good stunts in the movie as well but unlike Ong Bak , this movie uses CGI and wirework for a lot of stunts . If you think a guy riding a big rocket would look ridiculous , you are absolutely right . And judging by some of the extras I watched , this was apparently supposed to be a comedy as well as an action movie . You will definitely laugh but not at the intended humor which does n't translate well to the American audience . So in conclusion , the fight scenes were nothing special and this was a very weird movie . " ,3
" Definitely worth watching . Honestly now ... I read the comments before i watched this feature film , and I must say that I am glad I paid little to no interest in some of the posts i saw prior to my actual viewing . One must wonder what some of the so called `` critics '' use as the fundamentals for judging when they view different genres of movies.I mean come on now ... it 's a MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE ... what we want to see is martial arts action ... if you want a great plot then go and watch a psychological thriller or a drama . However , this is not to say that the plot of the feature film was at all empty , as I would say that the plot was far more fulfilling that our glamorized `` Onk Bak '' . The action in this feature was definitely entertaining , and the special power aspect gave rising to that of `` Kung fu Hustle '' while still retaining a realistic point of view . To summarize it all I would say that any martial arts fan or action lover will definitely agree that `` Dynamite Warrior '' surpasses the expectations beyond that of satisfactory . I rate it a solid 7\/10 after all was considered , as it managed to give me a feeling of euphoria after my viewing ... something which rarely happens . Do enjoy . " ,7
" A Nutshell Review : Dynamite Warrior . Dan Chupong probably got the role of his career so far when he got cast as the mysterious masked Crow Ghost in Ong Bak 2 , and kicked Tony Jaa 's rear in the film . It 's a pity that he still does n't get much recognition on his own accord given what 's essentially his marquee films such as Born to Fight -LRB- which I had watched some time back on the big screen , and enjoyed -RRB- , and this one titled Dynamite Warrior . Which is one heck of a ride as well , as far as an action movie is concerned . Chupong plays the titular character , aptly named because of his arsenal containing rockets of all shapes and sizes , which can be used as an offensive weapon such as projectiles with an explosive tip , or defensively to provide a quick boost in a modified escape vehicle for the late 19th century . Alternatively , some are large enough for him to ride on as well . Yes , you read me right , Chupong 's Jone Bang Fai is the quintessential explosives man , complete with Muay Thai elbow and knee moves to mop up and cripple opponents lucky enough to survive his shock - and-awe missile barrage . But of course you know the story ca n't be all too serious , since it 's a fusion of science and mythical elements , with evil wizards and spells being part of the equation on the villainous end , which our hero has to do combat with . In his quest to search for the killer of his parents , Jone Bang Fai conducts raids on buffalo traders , and soon come up against Lord Waeng -LRB- Leo Putt -RRB- , an evil aristocrat with a cleft lip , whose invention the Tractor gets no sales because the Thai farmers are still used to their buffaloes . So Waeng hatches a plan to eliminate the traditional competition , and this sets him on a collision course with Jone . Part of the fun here is the sword and sorcery type of storyline and characters , especially with Nai Hoi Sing -LRB- Samart Thipthamai -RRB- who proves to be quite the combatant since he 's magical tattoo gives him superpowers and the ability to discharge blows from a distance , making him quite untouchable . He also has the ability to ignite his followers Bak Paen -LRB- Wichai Promchan -RRB- and Bak Kaan -LRB- Ampol Rattanawong -RRB- into using fighting monkey and tiger moves , which adds to the fun factor somewhat , as they go up against the Black Wizard -LRB- Panna Rittikrai -RRB- who has a secret weapon through the use of a virgin 's menstrual blood -LRB- Yes , you read this right too ! -RRB- , and backed by Lord Waeng and his tough guy henchman with a voracious appetite , played by Somdej Keawlue . The story contains its usual twists and turns and provides for some nice , though expected , development of the plot , and the only time when it sagged , was when it decided to focus on the romantic aspects between Jone and the Black Wizard 's daughter Sao -LRB- Kanyapak Suworakood -RRB- , in a shy guy meets outcast girl routine , which took quite a while because well , we the audience accompanies Jone in waiting for her next menstrual cycle . But everything was worth the wait as it was a precursor to one of the largest fight sequences to take place in a cop station , before the finale all out assault on the baddies lair . Chupong dishes out plenty of of punishment as Jone Bang Fai , and if you 're a fan of Tony Jaa , I do n't see why you wo n't take to Dan Chupong and his brand of martial arts . The supporting cast , especially that of Samart Thipthamai also makes many of the fight scenes in the film worthwhile , and sequence after sequence just builds on what the previous had accomplished , making it a more than satisfying finale battle between good and evil , with plenty of bone crunching action to satisfy action fans anywhere . It 's not a perfect film , but it contains many elements that make this a fun movie to sit through being entertaining at its core . Dan Chupong really should have made a bigger impact , and that remains to be seen with bated breath . " ,7
" Dynamite ... . Dan Chupong , the star of DYNAMITE WARRIOR , would give even Tony Jaa a run for his money -LRB- and a film featuring the two of them together would no doubt rival Bruce Lee 's showdown with Chuck Norris in WAY OF THE DRAGON for one-on-one action -RRB- . Chupong , as the rocket-riding hero , has outstanding direction by Chalerm Wongpim to thank for making him look so good . Leo Putt as Lord Wang brings some much-appreciated comic relief to what in lesser hands could 've been an overly-grim slug fest of the `` mechanical martial arts '' variety -LRB- wherein the standard katas are performed by actors whose expressions never change -RRB- . DYNAMITE WARRIOR is a superlative blend of super-heroic feats , Thai martial arts techniques , and magic . There 's a schizo sorcerer , a monstrous , man-eating henchman , jumping monkey and leaping tiger underlings , spectacular stunts that need to be seen to be believed -LRB- Jackie Chan would be impressed -RRB- and rocket-riding . This one more than lives up to the promise of the trailer . A ten-plus . We may very well be seeing a new Golden Age of Action Films . " ,10
" This is a comic book story and a relatively fun one but it 's very comic book . . Tony Jaa - love this guy - he has done for Muay Thai what Bruce lee did for kung fu and he 's an awesome martial arts talent . For that reason alone you should see this movie - just be prepared for a LOT of SILLINESS with bottle rockets the size of courier tubes and complete ignorance of gravity and physics and editing in some of the stunts . This is a great movie for teens into martial arts movies since it has a light handling of adult situations that if I were directing , would probably result in this movie being banned in 18 countries . :--RRB- I think the roughest scene is when one guy takes a bite out of another guy and even that is handled pretty lightly . All that cartoonish mockery of a real film experience aside - this a fun little movie about a dude that has stupid bottle rockets and killer Muay Thai skill and a score to settle with a Cattle thief in pre industrial revulsion -LRB- some call it revolution -RRB- Thailand . He pairs up with some unlikely allies that started off as dire enemies to fight the ghost of a wizard who is a ghost from his past - using magical amulets to trap demons etc. . . I gave this movie an extra two points for being one of the only movies I know of to depict the Thai tradition of `` finding your animal spirit '' which is a ritual celebrated at Wai Kru festival where tattoos are made of a psychedelic ink that then creates a trance where the recipients `` become '' the animal the tattoo depicts - this is covered with two characters having tiger and monkey spirits respectively and a wizard activating their tattoos . Of course this is a Hollywood 7 second treatment of an all day ritual but it was still a fun nod to Thai history . Thai are a very proud people and this shows in their film making - they make a few nods to American movie making but the script continually resounds with a centrism on the Thai , probably because the story is in Thailand :--RRB- . This is directed by one of the camera men for Tom yum goong . The movie also mocks kung fu at the end which is a long held tradition apparently - to make fun of the weaker kung fu compared to the monstrous brutality of Muay Thai and Krabi Krabong . " ,7
" Very entertaining . I actually own a mix of over 40 old and new martial arts movies . I have also seen recent productions like City of Violence -LRB- Korea -RRB- and Kill Zone -LRB- china -RRB- and despite my great exposure to the genre this movie 's boldness in comedy , creative and action makes it stand out as the most fully entertaining action movie in a few years . I have seen ong bak , the protector , and born to fight all form the same director and enjoyed all three very much . This movie fits right in ; yet still stands out because of the originality , at least in the west , of its story . The main actor was very good and convincing in his fighting . I think the director is the among the best fight action choreographers and photographers in the movie industry second only to matrix legend yuen woo ping and tied with Corey Yuen . " ,8
" failed effort at Ong Bak with CGI . Talented stuntman\/fighter Dan Chupong -LRB- Born To Fight -RRB- is given little to work with in this repetitive , overlong mess from Thailand . Clearly hoping to bask in the financial glory of Ong Bak and The Protector -LRB- aka Tom Yum Goong -RRB- , this film seems rushed and it shows . The plot is terrible and the acting is substandard -LRB- even for a Thai film -RRB- . The action scenes are poorly conceived and filmed . Slow motion is used for shots that do n't deserve it and money shots almost always feature a cutaway revealing the choreographer 's complete inability to make the action scenes work . If they get any credit , it 's that they do n't stoop even lower and use the horrible `` shaky , camera on a string '' crap to further cover the shortcomings ! The character 's are cardboard and the set 's look like , well , sets ! The special effects are cheap -LRB- as in most modern Thai films -RRB- . Just a reminder to those Thai filmmakers who wish to emulate Ong Bak - 1 . Get talented martial artists stuntmen 2 . Concentrate on the quality of the fight scenes and do n't give in to CGI and cutaways . 3 . Keep the plot simple -LRB- the best martial arts films usually have minimal plot -RRB- If you are going to ask those talented stuntmen to risk injury or death , at least try to make a film worth them getting injured for !

" Bad ... Really Bad ... . I 've seen hundreds , possibly thousands of movies . I sat through the abomination that was Tomb Raider 2 . I watched the blindness producing Torque all the way through . But this ... this was just unwatchable . I love action\/martial arts movies ... who does n't ? But this is just awful . First it starts off with some exciting action , then degrades into a truly spectacular piece of crap , with a giant , a wizard , and a monkey man . Yes , I 'm being serious . Once we met the wizard , I turned it off . No action in the world was good enough to make me keep watching . This movie had some truly awful acting , even for Thai movies this was bad . The action ? boring , with one or 2 memorable scenes which I already saw on the trailer . The hero ? only uses his knees . watching him kick the crap out of people the same exact way for 20 minutes gets boring ... fast . Special effects ? My god , they were bad ... i mean we had the hero riding a rocket like a surfboard ... Christ almighty can you believe that crap ?! I feel stupider just having watched this movie , I urge you to save some brain cells and skip it . Watch Ong Bak , watch Tom Yum Goong , heck watch em twice , just do n't watch this movie . - Inferno " ,1

" An excellent rendition of a good Stephen King story on revenge and determination . . The movie is certainly worth a watch.It is the tale of a revenge seeking spouse 's determined efforts to kill an almost untouchable criminal.It is based on a short story by Stephen King.There are a few changes , but it is true to the original story and the few changes in the story are effective . The movie could be worth a rating of 9 or 9.5 if not for the first 15 to 20 minutes of the the movie.Emmanuelle Vaugier 's dialogs are really bad and her acting is not great either.Wes Bentley as the protagonist was disappointing for the first 20 minutes but he is excellent thereafter as a determined , disoriented revenge-seeking monster . Christian Slater makes a lasting impact every time he is on the screen . The music , editing , dialogs -LRB- barring the first few minutes -RRB- , cinematography and performances are pretty good . Though the first 20 minutes of the movie are not noteworthy the last 20 minutes are in complete contrast and stand out . " ,7
" i really enjoyed it . worth watching . Just watched the movie a min ago , and I have to say , I enjoyed it . The story line is very good , and it keeps you hooked to it and wanting to get more out of it , but then all movies based on Stephen King 's novels are . the acting was pretty decent as well , both lead actors played their role perfectly and I always saw that Christian Slater dose better roles as a villain , do n't know he just have this evil look in him , The story was very real and without exaggeration , and it flows with the modern times that we are in , there is some action and some moments that just keep you on your feet . Some great lines and quotes are in there as well . Over all this is a pretty decant revenge movie , and I would recommend it to anyway who enjoys a good film . " ,9
" Dolan really had a Cadillac !!! . I liked this movie . Though its not a brilliant movie that blows your mind away , this still is a good watch . Its not the usual revenge flick with lotsa action and nothing more . This movie had originality in showing the revenge seeked by a husband whose wife got murdered by criminals because she was a witness of murders in a desert . I liked the way our hero was not shown as a superman who just walks and throws people away as if they were pieces of rough paper . This man is a normal guy who is scared of criminals but still wants revenge . He gets defeated by the villain quite a few number of times , but still does not give up . Realizing he ca n't win over them by just using guns and trying to kill them , he hatches a plan to seek revenge . And boy , what a method it was !! This movie really has one of the best climax in recent times . And the last scene is one of the most original scene I have seen in a long long time . Of course you know what would happen in the end but still you would like to watch it . Definitely recommended !!! " ,7
" Unremarkable in every way . Recap : Life is looking good for Robinson and his fianc e Elizabeth . But one day everything changes . Elizabeth is out riding in the hills and witnesses the brutal murders of a whole group of young women by trafficking mobster Dolan . Dolan is known for getting rid of all competition and threats but Elizabeth is determined to witness . Despite getting protection from the FBI Dolan manages to murder her and Robinson goes on a quest for revenge . But Dolan 's car , a Cadillac , is a fortress in itself , armored and bulletproof , so Robinson must think of something special . Comments : A rather bad movie that actually is rather hard to put into a genre . It got a little action but not enough to make it an action . It is probably supposed to be a thriller , but it does n't got much of suspense . And it certainly is n't a romance , comedy or drama . It got a little of everything , but it is nothing in the end . The story is very simple and divided into three parts . First , the setup . Show the happy couple , kill the girl and give proper motivation for Robinson 's quest . Then , the plot . This is where Robinson plans his special revenge , which plays out by him working as a road-worker . Not very exciting at all . And last , the revenge . Which is not very exciting either , because it is very single sided . Oh , I 'm sure Robinson got a kick out of it , but to watch it . Nah . Unfortunately , but not very surprising , the acting is nothing to remember either . Well , I suppose there was n't much to do with the material at hand , but still . The cast is mostly unknown , to me at least , with the exception of Slater . I have higher expectations on him , although his recent work does n't promise much . Vaugier was the only one that showed some promise , and I hope she gets another shot . In conclusion , not a good movie , but not too bad either . Nothing to remember , and there are many better movies out there . 4\/10 " ,4
" The Arc of Descent . In Las Vegas , the school teachers Robinson -LRB- Wes Bentley -RRB- and his wife Elizabeth -LRB- Emmanuelle Vaugier -RRB- are trying to have a baby . While riding a horse through the desert after hours , Elizabeth witnesses the execution of two coyotes and an illegal immigrant by the human trafficker Jimmy Dolan -LRB- Christian Slater -RRB- and she decides to report to the police . However , she loses her cellular and Dolan tracks her address and threatens her . Elizabeth goes to the FBI with Robinson and they move to a safe house under the protection of two agents . When Elizabeth sneaks from the house to buy pregnancy tests , her car explodes and she dies . The disturbed Robinson decides to buy a powerful revolver and learn how to shoot to revenge Elizabeth killing Dolan . But the mobster and his henchman find him in a bar and beat up on him . Robinson goes to the rock bottom of his life but he retrieves and plots a sophisticated revenge . Dolan 's Cadillac is a dark tale of revenge based on a short story of Stephen king . Christian Slater is a great sadistic villain but unfortunately Wes Bentley with his wooden expression and Emmanuelle Vaugier with her cynical smile are not convincing in their roles of school teachers that have their lives destroyed due to the sequence of stupid attitudes of Elizabeth . Anyway , movies about revenge are usually engaging and this one is above average . My vote is seven . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : Sede de Vingan a -LRB- Thirsty of Revenge -RRB- " ,7
" Undemanding adaptation of a simple story . When his wife is killed by mobster Dolan after she witnessed him committing murder , grief-stricken Robinson hatches a plan to exact retribution . You see , Dolan regularly drives between Los Angeles and Las Vegas , and sometimes there are roadworks ... Dolan 's Cadillac is one of Stephen King 's simplest short stories , lovingly crafted around a number of technical issues the answers to which were supplied to him by his big brother . Those technicalities are not necessary in the film - what happens happens , we see it but we do n't need to know exactly how - and , instead , other aspects of the story are amplified -LRB- and , indeed , added -RRB- . The main story beats remain consistent , however . Christian Slater treads a fine line between inhuman urbanity and crazed loon as Dolan 's fate unfolds . Wes Bentley is fine as the grieving and somewhat unhinged Robinson , and Emmanuelle Vaugier is adequate as the doomed Elizabeth . This film passes the time but is otherwise fairly unmemorable . " ,7
" I agree it was a good movie ! . I 'm not sure why this would be a direct to DVD movie because it is a lot better than some of the crap I have seen hit the theaters . I mean , the movie The Watchmen made it into the theaters did n't it ? or The Spirit ? Now those were a waste of time in my opinion . I love Christian Slater and he did an excellent job portraying an evil bastard that you love to hate . As said on another comment , it 's not a huge blockbuster but it is definitely a good watch and I would recommend it . Perhaps you need to be a little morbid to enjoy it as much as I did but it needs to get the recognition that it deserves . Just because the trailer shows a lot of the movie does n't mean you know everything . Trust me , I was surprised at the end . I give it a 2 thumbs up ! " ,8
" Good thriller . The film Dolan 's Cadillac addresses the sad issue of the traffic of illegal immigrants in the United States , in this case women destined for prostitution rings . Jimmy Dolan is one such trafficker . The part is played in a masterful way by Christian Slater who manages to appear as a particularly vicious and spiteful character . He is especially brilliant in the last scene . The film uses the old time narrative favorite of taking a Mr Everybody , in this case Wes Bentley in the part of a school teacher , placed in a situation he is not cut for , thus ensuring viewer identification with the main protagonist . A short thriller unlike some other material by Stephen King with good montage and music . " ,8
" Good concept , horrible execution . I 'm not a major King fan although some of his work is clearly brilliant . I did n't read the story here but the basic concept is pretty obvious and it seems quite workable . The problem with the movie was that it dragged and dragged and dragged while beating us endlessly over the head with the fundamental plot points . Slater 's character is a bad guy . We get that . It is not necessary that we go through scene after repetitive scene to prove the point . His rival is slowly driven nuts , becoming a sadist in his plans to seek revenge , however justifiable that might be . Unfortunately the acting is not strong enough to carry all this in a way that is entertaining . In fact it becomes downright boring . Do we really need to watch him shoveling dirt , falling over , shoveling more dirt , grabbing at water , pushing around a machine -- this plot line goes on and on and endlessly and pointlessly . Or rather the point is made in the first minute and followed by and endless sequence making the same point . Were they getting paid by the reel inch ? I 'll bet the short story was good . It 's too bad they did n't make a short movie , because it might have been better . " ,3
" Really Bad , and not in a good way . . Robinson -LRB- Bentley -RRB- is out to kill Dolan -LRB- Slater -RRB- for killing wife Elizabeth -LRB- Vaugier -RRB- This whole thing reeked of amateurs trying to act like professionals . Really bad . The dialogue suffered as did we all . I almost shut this down but wanted to see how Robinson , a 6th grade teacher , would take care of business with Dolan , a crime boss in Las Vegas . This should have been left as a short story by Stephen King . It 's the dialogue that made the actors look and sound like they were rehearsing lines . To be fair , the last third of the movie was better , but when you are scurrying around putting someone to death what was learned in acting class does n't seem to help much . By the same token when you are the one being snuffed , the screaming and pleading almost seemed real enough , but what was learned in acting class does n't seem to help much . I had no sympathy for the snuffer or the snufee . Maybe there were never any acting classes . Now , what does the Cadillac have to do with all this ? Well , Dolan practically lived in it and when Robinson was taking care of business , the Cadillac became a prime player . Really bad . Violence : Yes . Sex : No . Nudity : No , but came close . Racial slurs : Yes . Language : Yes , non stop . " ,2
" Construction 101 meets C class production . I must start my review with the expression and\/or term WOW . The main thought with the the expression\/term WOW is that this production receives a 5.7 vote . This score does not shock me since the production only has a meager amount of votes . Evidently the cast , producers , stage managers , costume designers , homeless people that take bribes , co-producers , and others involved in this film can vote . I often sit at home and wonder how I can apply construction experience to the revenge on a murderer that took the life of a loved one . I then contemplate an elaborate scheme that has so many flaws that only a person in the industry could point out . Shame on Christian Slater -LRB- although I always enjoy his attempt to never change his haircut in the last two decades -RRB- and Stephen King for this nightmare idea based on his short story . Many times on the job when I am working really hard I wonder how my face gets so dirty -LRB- not really , it is the 21st century ... labor is over ... if a machine ca n't do it , it does n't get done -RRB- . I then ponder why I am shovelling dirt -LRB- straticically staged in front of a backhoe -RRB- with such great effort one shovel at a time for hours ... if not days while a perfectly capable machine is sitting there eager to reduce hours and days of work . One of the many riveting parts of this masterpiece is a lesson . When trapped in a vehicle with overburden material being placed from above -LRB- soil in this case -RRB- and all four -LRB- 4 -RRB- sides of your Cadillac Escalade -LRB- 2007 - 2010 model -RRB- trapped in a vertical hole approximately 10 ' deep rectangular with absolutely no vertical deficiencies and there is only one escape route -LRB- up -RRB- what do you do ? A -RRB- shoot your fully loaded 9mm handgun out the window and through the roof with no hopes of hitting a target or improving your situation , B -RRB- choose to remain in the vehicle while being buried alive while using method -LRB- A -RRB- and screaming annoyingly , or C -RRB- put one shot through the moon\/sun roof , carefully escape and continue a competitive gig in the prostitution ring of NV ? My stomach churns with disgust . Honestly I was hoping for a True Romance performance from Christian and a American Beauty performance from Billy Badass , Aka - Construction Worker\/School Teacher\/Murderer\/I ruined my acting career by not only accepting but following through with this role . I applaud this films production and acting . This movie gives hope to everyone that thought creating a movie and acting in a movie was only for select individuals . Now we all know -LRB- if you 've viewed this fantastic portrait of a poetic , classic and historic piece -RRB- that our childhood dreams are now not only possible but can easily surpass the the previous rendering that talents were preffered in the business . " ,1
" Better than I Thought . As a lifelong reader of Stephen King , I got this on-sale-for-five-bucks-at-redbox movie expecting an epic flop . I did n't even realize they 'd made a movie out of what is -LRB- I shiite thee not -RRB- one of my top 3 favorite Stephen King stories of all time , but I saw it had Christian Slater and Blackheart from Ghost Rider and ... gravy . Honestly , I bought the movie thinking that Slater was the protagonist , so imagine my shock when I found out he was playing Dolan . When I read the story as a kid , I think I imagined Dolan as more of a Robert DiNiro , Al Pacino or even Mickey Rourke . Given those biases , I really had a hard time buying Slater as Dolan . At first . However , I really saw him come into his own in those scenes where he 's looking at the girls , the very end in the Caddy and some of his sleazier moments . Still , I think that Slater was a little too young-looking to portray a gangster . I 'll agree with most other reviewer 's assertions that the last third was the best part . But I will add that even if the rest of the movie completely sucked , it was still worth it to see those two play out the final scene that Stephen King painted years ago . The scenes where Richardson stood screaming at his shredded gloves was right out of my imagination . Fantastic . In short , I give about 15 minutes of this movie a 4 and the rest a 9 , so it averages out to an eight . Definitely worth the $ 5 I paid for it by easily a factor of four . " ,8
" The mind of Stephen King is a terrible thing to waste . . The director of DOLAN 'S CADILLAC , Jeff Beesley , was told by his agent , If you ca n't knock this movie outta the park , you might as well forget it - go back to pumping gas . Uh , Jeff , I got some bad news ... From a Stephen King short story of the same name -LRB- from the 1993 collection , Nightmares and Dreamscapes -RRB- , screenwriter Richard Dooling misses the point completely and somehow thinks he can improve on a writing legend 's plot elements - much like the rewriters of THE SOUND OF THUNDER -LRB- 2005 -RRB- had the brass balls to think they could improve on a Ray Bradbury story . DOLAN 'S CADILLAC - a straight-to-DVD release - is another great Stephen King story wasted onto the small screen . Robinson -LRB- Wes Bentley -RRB- and wife Elizabeth -LRB- Emmanuelle Vaugier -RRB- are a regular Las Vegas couple , whose life is upended when Elizabeth witnesses human-trafficker Dolan -LRB- Christian Slater -RRB- execute people in the Nevada desert . Dolan has her killed . Robinson gets revenge in a very unique , exacting way . Dolan is chauffered around in a bulletproof Cadillac as fortified as a tank . In the short story , Robinson uses this fact to entomb Dolan in a highway grave , the first person narrative pathologically taking us through the meticulous life-planning and interesting physics of devising the trap . In the book , the arc of descent becomes a blueprint for Robinson 's subterranean trap and a metaphor for his psychological and physical deterioration . While in the movie , the arc of descent is something that Dolan pulls out of thin air while standing at a pee trough . Was that the writer 's subliminal message to us ? : I 'm URINATING ALL OVER STEPHEN KING ! King 's characters are efficiently made two-dimensional by leaden Wes Bentley -LRB- whose terrifically vapid performance in GHOST RIDER must have scored him this role -RRB- and Christian Slater , getting drunk on Jack -LRB- Nicholson , not Daniels -RRB- . The highway trap is merely a flat drop covered with tarpaulin . No science required . In trying to extend King 's story to movie length , instead of inserting all those interesting master plan elements , which would have drawn out the time compellingly , screenwriter Dooling puts in banalities : Robinson buying a Dirty Harry gun , Dolan extending his trafficking to children , Chinese mobsters , an FBI guy -LRB- Al Sapienza from THE SOPRANOS -RRB- and loads of black mascara for Wes Bentley in lieu of acting . To hear director Beesley speak of his filmic debacle in the DVD Featurette is to wonder whether he has ever viewed his own film : ... extremely entertaining ... a great ride ... a Saturday night popcorn movie ... And here 's the one that made peanuts fly out of my nose : At its heart it 's very much an art film . Choke . Gasp . Bwohahahahahaha ! King 's story was an homage to Edgar Allan Poe 's The Cask of Amontillado in subtle , disturbing ways ; story described in detail how Dolan 's highway grave could never be discovered . Beesley 's movie gives us a scene of Robinson shifting a final stone slab into place over Dolan 's screaming face , for the sole reason to echo Poe 's -LRB- and King 's -RRB- words , For the love of God , no ! But this final homage is Beesley 's final illogical mistake . The manner in which Beesley 's trap is built is rife for discovery by authorities ; the final stupid stone over Beesley 's own face . Poe and King have assured themselves their places in history . Beesley has assured himself a career at the Shell Gas-N-Go . Fill ` er up please , Jeff . " ,3
" Stony face Robinson makes a lunar crater by hand !!! . I do n't get it . Why Hollywood makes so many movies where they make us feel sympathy for the villain ? Why so many movies about drug pushers , drug users , the scum of society with no redeeming values in film after film , almost all of them alike scene after scene ? If we saw one , we saw them all . The detective -LRB- police , whatever -RRB- whose wife is killed and he has to avenge her death by himself , etc. . How many times have we seen that ??? I know while I write this , I must sound like a sort of a preacher , but maybe it 's because I do n't have the ease of language to express myself in a deeper way about what I feel . I 'm not shocked by this sort of films , I 'm just BORED . How many improbabilities we see throughout the length of this film ? Too many to name them . Just a few : Robinson 's girlfriend finished that product she was using so much and leaves the apartment building in a rush at midnight to get more of it , when she knew very well her life was in danger . She would never have done that in real life . Dolan speaks CONSTANTLY on his cell phone , why then , instead of screaming his head off when he 's trapped in his Cadillac , he does n't call members of his gang and ask them to rescue him ? How could ONE PERSON -LRB- Robinson -RRB- excavate such an enormous crater BY HIMSELF !! and then cover it again BY HIMSELF !!! -LRB- Superman in disguise ? -RRB- What about road traffic ? Road traffic DISAPPEARED completely from that area during the whole time of this incident !!! Really ... , they are asking us to withhold judgment in such large a degree for any thinking viewer ... But obviously some people enjoy this type of films very much -LRB- otherwise they would never be done -RRB- . The end is perfectly ridiculous . " ,3
" Crybaby seeks revenge for bad guy killing his wife . The hero of this movie has no redeeming qualities ! Though bent on revenge , he has to crybaby breakdowns , then becomes tough shoveling dirt on a highway construction job -LRB- those guys do n't look tough to me -RRB- and then comes up with a crazy plan to bury the bad guy in a hole in the highway . Luckily for him , no cars come by after the initial three that appear right after Dolan 's Cadillac is driven into the hole . The hero then tries to bury the car with one load of dirt , that he shovels in by hand , rather than using the front loader that he has available . An effort is made to make him appear to be crazed but all the movie does is make him look stupid . Slater on the other hand plays the same character he played in Pursued . It is unlikely that anyone of Oriental heritage will enjoy the racist crap he has to say about them . Nothing here for those who like good movies , or even those that can accept so-so movies ... " ,2
" This cadillac fails to satisfy in any sense of the word . I ca n't believe this film was the imagination of Stephen King . This crap is almost a ninety minute view of torture . Christian Slater playing evil and he does n't do a half bad job of it as mob guy\/slave trader , Dolan , who 's now resorted to selling kids for suck clientele , and profiting fruitfully from it . He has his own supply of costumes on standby too , so he 's got his s. . t together . A beautiful witness , -LRB- Mia from Two And A Half Men -RRB- who has seen at first hand , the special cargo being loaded up , is taken out . The boyfriend , a teacher , now becomes completely obsessed and psychologically hell bent on tasking out Slater , first being worked over by him which intensifies his rage . Her image burns in his memory as he 's sees a phantom of her on the lonely highway . He hatches a plan . He becomes a road worker , and carves out a section of loose bitumin , to entrap our Slater , which of course works , where Dolan 's Cadillac goes under , with Slater begging for mercy . No suspense here , or in anything . That 's it . End of movie . We see Slater minutes before going under , viewing some of the kiddies , on his laptop , holding numbers , a pang of conscience , looking away before looking back , but this son of a bitch has dug his own grave , the same place this movie should be laid to rest . The best part of this dreck is some of the hot girls in lingerie , put on show , but apart from that , forget it , this Cadillac sucks , this movie robbing people of their valuable time . " ,3
" Dull and Dumb as Dirt . Ageless Christian Slater is the only thing in this really bad movie that is remotely interesting and it is n't enough to pull this out of the ditch of dull , dismal and disastrous movies . The other actors are so wooden and lifeless that they barely register . The protagonist mumbles , cries , whines , and looks like he is about to fall asleep most of the time . It manages to make Las Vegas look bland and a Stephen King story to be agonizingly boring . When Dolan is on screen spouting his racist , misanthropic monologues the film manages to be palatable but that 's it . The script is unintentionally funny and can actually cause spontaneous outbursts of laughter . This is lame and listless with the last twenty minutes painful to watch with the two characters constantly yelling at each other . A straight to video bomb that is as dumb as dirt and clunks along with one boring scene after another . After seeing this unpleasantness you will have to open a window just to get some air and remove the stale stench of decrepitude . " ,1
" If you are reading this because you liked the short story , go for it . If you are reading this because you liked the short story I would say go for it . I read the story in Nightmares and Dreamscapes and it hung with me . I do n't understand the negative comments and all I can figure is that : A. They did n't read the story or B. They did n't read the story . For gods sake , it 's not an academy award winner and it was n't intended to be . This was a very good enactment of the story and that 's about all I can say . Not bad for a Saturday afternoon throw away movie . It delivers the essence of the story , Also I would advise any Stephen King fans to read or listen to the audio book , On Writing . It 's pretty much an autobiography of the trials and tribulations of a writer who will go down in history as a contemporary , or superior , of any given living writer . Even if you do n't write and you just enjoy the reading you will gain volumes of insight into King 's mind . It 's every bit as fascinating as any of his novels or short stories . Do n't dilly dally , just watch it . " ,7
" Do NOT waste your time . This is really hard for me to do , as Christian Slater is my favorite actor , but this movie was , well terrible . As well as being a Slater fan , i also like Stephen King , but this really disappoints , It starts off with Jimmy Dolan killing a couple of immigrant 's , as he is a trafficker and burying them alive in the Nevada desert , whilst being watched by a school teacher played by Emmanuele Vaugier -LRB- check spelling -RRB- , so Dolan order 's her death , she is put into protective custody along with her partner , Wes Bentley , she ends up dead and Bentley goes on the hunt for revenge , he has numerous opportunities but fails to take them , the same being said for Slater , who also has the opportunity to get rid of Bentley , but makes a mistake by not doing so . I only gave it a 3 because Slaters performance was good enough , but i 'm sorry to all Wes Bentley fans , as i get angry when people slag Slater , but this guy really ca n't act , the last 10 minutes of the film , he gets a pass from me , but up until then , he is like a lump of wood , again , i apologise for being negative about him , but in this movie , he deserves it . I beg you not to watch this , even if your a Slater fan . " ,3
" A very pained man plots a most artistic , original revenge , after his wife is killed by a mobster . . This movie totally rocks !! Especially for all of you who fell in love with Christian Slater 's performance in Heather 's . He has this face that just can not be duplicated - the eyes , that grin , the eyebrows , the wicked voice . But he never could really grasp that perfection again . Oh , he was GREAT in Murder in the First ; GOOD in Untamed Heart , Hard Rain , Broken Arrow , and True Romance ; OKAY in The Contender , Young Guns 2 , Robin Hood ; and although Pump Up the Volume was a little weird , it was actually enjoyable . My point is , after Heathers , it took Slater 22 YEARS to again reach that perfect character . He -LRB- being the bad guy -RRB- , performed his BEST acting , since Heathers , in this movie . Very memorable performance . And the perfect role for him . Then there 's Wes Bentley - mostly known for his dark roles -LRB- I mean , look at that face , those eyes - he just screams those types of roles ! -RRB- . But after great performances in movies like Ghost Rider , American Beauty , Soul Survivors , The Ungodly , and P2 , you will be pleasantly surprised with Wes ' role in this movie . He 's a man in pain , after losing his wife to a killer , yet he 's kind of hard to figure out . Yeah , he 's gon na go after the guy for revenge , but it 's his methods that kind of confuse you . You 're actually completely unsure of Wes ' full intentions until THE very end of the movie . If you 're a smoker , you 'll want to go for a smoke , if you 're not , you might want a cigarette anyway ! The cool thing about the movie as a whole is , the fact that there 's not fifty characters running around , to keep up with . Just a handful of great performances from beginning to end . And the movie does us the favor of going straight from the beginning to the end , without a lot of bullshit , stalling , or boring periods of time to endure . I could n't think of anything that I would change , or add to this movie . It was moving , exciting , sad , eerie , unpredictable , and definitely original . No , I have n't read the book , and I do n't intend to - I have n't had a movie grip me in this way in a long time , and I do n't want to chance altering that . I have to add , that Al Sapienza , who I had NEVER heard of in my life , was also excellent in this movie . He has a certain it factor going on , and he played his role well . -LRB- Nice on the eyes , as well -RRB- . My opinion : If you like a good thriller -LRB- not horror -RRB- , with continuous entertainment from beginning to the end , then you have got to check out this movie . -LRB- Especially those of you , like me , that have been desperately waiting for Christian Slater to push that bar again - HE FINALLY DID IT !! GAVE IT 100 % !! -RRB- . Enjoy . " ,10
" Dolan 's Cadallic Review . I do not want to get into too much detail about this movie , as it does not deserve that much time , however I do want to say this ; THIS MOVIE SUCKS ! Personally , I like Christian Slater and Wes Bentley but nothing could save this movie from the dreadful screen adaptation and directing . The movies first 30 minutes were so bad that I would not even give it the honor of having B movie status and the rest was so poorly acted due to the directing that you just wanted to shut the thing off . This movie will never make it to the big screen in the US , nor will most foreign markets entertain such horribly bad film making . The story was written by Stephen King and is a decent short story but about revenge but the only revenge should be on the audience wanting an hour and a half of their life back . -LRB- Important : Some movies are bad because the actors are bad , in this case the actors are bad because of the directing and not due to lack of skill . -RRB- " ,1
" A dissent psycho thriller , not bad at all . A dissent psycho thriller , not bad at all What we have here is Stephen King novel made movie . And we have not a typical Stephen King story . Nothing is out of the ordinary , nothing is so-o-o-o-o scary Story unfolds , the rhythm and paste is fast , climax is logical , everything comes to its place ... Emmanuelle Vaugier is beautiful and her Elizabeth is believable as a character . Christian Slater is very good , being bad-bad guy as Dolan . His Cadillac is for real and takes center stage trough the entire film . I guess those ware some of the last advertiser 's dollars GM used to spend before the bankruptcy Music and sound editing is up to the level supporting the thriller suspense of this entire story . It could be one of many typical crime dramas that you forget 5 minutes after the final credits , but here we have something to remember . Dolan 's Cadillac lives impressions in one 's mind , makes you think , What would I do , if I was there Well , making you think is the goal of every art including the art of cinema . " ,7
" very bad ... movie . yes slater played in very bad things , but the very bad thing is this movie . probably the worst flick straight to DVD I 've seen in awhile . bad script , bad acting and bad directing . i do n't recommend this summer failure not even to my worst enemy . i give him three stars for my favorite actor , Christian slater , who can do best , i know that . I 'm going to read the novel so i can see if Stephen king really gone stupid or what ? the man that wrote the shining , shaw shank redemption , misery is now stuck in a horrible flick like Dolan 's Cadillac ? i do n't think so , maybe the novel it 's far way better than this very bad film ... by points , i can say some causes for this failure : 1 . the script it 's very lame 2 . the characters are so poor and their background lacks in every aspect 3 . the casting it 's also uninspired 4 . Wes Bentley 5 . the directing looks like the work of a blind man , not Stevie wonder , cause he 's a genius ... " ,3

" Worth your time and dollar . Good story , solid acting and the twists are sensible rather than out of thin air which is getting common these days . Believable characters , storyline , action scenes and you 're not put in a position where you have but no choice to criticize the film makers . This is a good crime suspense drama . The legal scenarios are realistic and do n't rely on an ideal legal system that does n't exist . The chain of events are executed perfectly without getting congested by sub plots or useless scenes . While a couple of the actors are over the top and look a bit goofy in a couple scenes , the overall character performances by the cast are strong and real . This is a good movie where the IMDb ratings simply are n't doing it justice . Worth your dollar and time . " ,10
" In no way great but quite OK . . There 's nothing new about Breaking Point and , in the end , it 's pretty predictable . But I 'm a huge fan of both Tom Berenger and Armand Assante , two very decent actors who have n't gotten a decent film role in ages . Straight to DVD is what we mostly get from these guys -LRB- though I believe this film had a short theatrical run a month prior to it 's DVD release -RRB- and they vary considerably in quality . But I was somewhat excited about Breaking Point , despite starring Busta Rhymes . As a drama piece ; you get somewhat involved into the plight of disgraced attorney Steven Luisi 's -LRB- Berenger -RRB- attempt to defend an innocent man accused of murdering his girlfriend and baby . Throw into the mix a very nasty killer -LRB- Rhymes -RRB- and a dubious district attorney -LRB- Assante -RRB- and you get a fairly shallow but reasonably action packed drama piece about redemption in the face of much corruption and back stabbings . The problem here is the script relies too much on clich s. This could easily be a double episode in an above average TV legal show and in particular the bad dialog hurts the film . That said , the inevitable twist here -LRB- though fairly predictable -RRB- is reasonable enough and does n't come completely out of left field . As for performances ; Berenger has perfected his brooding skills and overall he gives a very good performance here . His character is somewhat underwritten and given a very clich d back story . Some potentially good sequences , such as him attending a meeting discussing his drug addiction or a further flesh-out of his relationship with Musetta Vander , would have given us better insight into his character but never appear . Assante is given fairly little to do but he 's always a forceful presence and manages to squeeze in a solid performance . As for Rhymes ; well , he 's a lot more tolerable here than in Halloween : Resurrection , that 's for sure . In fact ; he 's quite OK . Breaking Point wo n't stay long in your memory but it 's a decent enough way to spend and hour and a half . Berenger once again proves he 's worthy of good roles and Assante should be given the benefit of the doubt as well . " ,7
" The Ratings are Accurate for a Reason . I read the reviews here before renting at Redbox . Berenger has n't always disappointed and I thought it might be worth a shot . I was wrong . I should have believed the ratings and reviews here . The only reason I did n't rate it awful is that the camera was on tripod and did n't jerk around . The cinematographer was able to frame some pretty scenery of New York . Other than that , I do n't have a lot to offer in the way of kinds words . No story , no hook to keep you involved , a mish-mash of fade-backs that are so subtle they are confusing . To say it is clich d would be to say it is the difference between chicken salad and chicken scratch . I do n't know how it ended . I could only stand 30 minutes of it before I decided my life was draining away watching it . Stay with the Hit Movies and Top 20 at Redbox . The rest of them are bombs waiting to go off in your DVD player . " ,2
" Really not impressed . I was not impressed with this movie . If a movie does n't catch my attention in the first 30 minutes I wo n't watch the rest . It started out violent and I had no idea what the plot even was . All I saw was violence , murder , and drug abuse but no real substance . I did n't finish it . Even the people I was watching it with did n't get the point of the movie either . I was expecting something great out of it though the actors in the film were not names which with I was familiar . Fighting for truth and justice are good causes , but I only saw that in the plot synopsis . I guess it takes a while into the movie to finally get the idea that is what is going on . " ,3
" Much Better Then Expected . I do n't know why this is rated so low . True it 's closer to 7 than 8 , but come on , how amazing a movie did people expect from Berenger and Busta ? 7 out of 10 is a huge accomplishment for them , so I say 8 . That said , they actually may have given their best performances ever in this film . Somehow Assante was at the lower end of the performance calibre . He does alright I guess , but it 's Armand Assante , decent is his minimum . Sticky Fingaz is pretty decent too . I ca n't stress enough the amazing job old Tom Berenger comes up with , I assume good direction helped , but you really feel for his character , just as on the flip side , Busta Rhymes does a bang up job getting you to hate his character , I wanted to end him seconds into his appearance , and more every second thereafter . The story and direction etc are all decent , certainly above average compared to what one would expect . It 's only fair to note that towards the end of the movie , the quality declines a bit , I guess they spent too much time making the rest of it as good as they could , and they had to rush . Whatever , I was pleasantly surprised , I enjoyed the movie for the most part , you probably will too . " ,8
" Much better than expected . This film was far better than I expected . I rented it from Red Box on the way home just to have something on while I was doing something else , but the intensity of the scenes kept grabbing my attention until I relented , and sat down to watch it . Busta was a straight-up monster in this film and demanded my attention and props . Even in his comedic rap lyrics he has always given off an angry vibe ; this was the perfect vehicle to express that rage . He was genuinely scary and I have n't thought that of a character in a long time . Berenger held his own in the role of a washed up semi-x-junkie lawyer , but because the character was n't that interesting the actor did n't have much to work with ; other notable -LRB- supporting -RRB- performances where Richard Allen as Sticky Fingaz and Frankie Faison as Judge Green . " ,7
" Nope , pretty bad . . Flickers of sophistication . Otherwise , too long , too sentimental , too unselfconsciously overplayed . Berenger almost pulls off the sympathetic broken man character , but without enough cheap action to prop him up , he pretty much melts into the part . The premise is stock standard enough that a brainless monkey should be able to make a movie around it , but the script is so unbelievable , and oddly structured -LRB- moments of grainy flashback flicker sporadically through the plot , gradually advancing an all too obvious and predictable back story -RRB- , with characters introduced in tossed-off , sitcom-ish scenes , never to reappear again , that its hard to get through more than a scene or two without groaning . Still , there are flares of inspiration - or rather , imitation with skill . But they are transitory moments - literally . As my first English teacher said when she was looking for something nice to say about one of my essays : Good transitions ! " ,3
" A good thriller underrated , and by whom ? . Giving this film a 4.8 out of 362 spectators : is this some kind of bad joke ? This is a good gripping thriller with good acting especially by Busta Rhymes who is really frightening in his scenes . Well done . I am not a rap fan , do n't know nothing about rap , etc. . . do n't like it too much , maybe I do n't understand it , I do n't know these people , so my appreciation is straightforward .

" very very good film , i 'll tell you why . Just watched Breaking Point , and i have to say its a great movie . It really grabs your attention from the start , making the viewer feel involved in the storyline . I love a film that makes you hang on the actor\/s every word when trying to grasp the situation . Also , i was impressed with the acting of both rappers Busta rhymes and Sticky Fingaz . Busta was actually a very good villain in this picture . All the actors proved very sincere and honest . Another plus is the way the story is interconnected between characters , which never leaves a boring dull moment . Which is why i am disappointed that this film was given such a low rating . I even made this account just now to write my review on it :-RRB- Oh and not to forget ... the composer and music soundtrack should really get a lot of the credit . If your a Scorsese buff like me who appreciates the right sound for the right visual . This is definitely worth the time to watch . Conclusion : No cheesy comedy included -LRB- thank you Mr. director -RRB- Musetta Vander was beautiful , Craig muMs Grant -LRB- who was Poet in the prison drama Oz -RRB- was a nice added touch and Armand Assante had a somewhat Al Pacino quality in his performance . That 's All Folks !!! If your into crime thrillers that involve some law enforcement mixed with psychological game play ; this is definitely a treat " ,9
" Saw it at Sundance . The Merry Gentleman -LRB- Dir : Michael Keaton -RRB- : The word on the `` street '' -LRB- or shuttle -RRB- was `` eh '' for Keaton 's directorial debut , as it was for other gems like `` Quid Pro Quo '' and `` The Escapist '' . That 's too bad , especially considering hot tickets like `` The Great Buck Howard '' were underwhelming compared to the lower-profile films . The Merry Gentleman is slow paced , yes , but that 's an attribute . Keaton does n't rush anything in his story of a lonely young woman -LRB- Kelly McDonald -RRB- who is the locus of desire for several men , including her ex-husband -LRB- a great Bobby Cannavale -RRB- , an alcoholic cop , and a suicidal hit-man -LRB- Keaton -RRB- . He honors the complexity of the situation with an ending as open ended as it is authentic . It is a glowingly photographed , impeccably performed magical realist drama , one that I 'm glad exists in a market where it can not thrive -LRB- just like the best Alan Rudolph films -RRB- . Taking place during two of the loneliest holidays -LRB- Christmas and Valentine 's day -RRB- , The Merry Gentleman is also a great religious film , movingly detailing McDonald 's faith as she in turn becomes a figure of worship for men with a variety of intentions . It even ends with a resurrection . As a primer on our ability to `` save '' each other , this is nothing less than rapturous , and Keaton infuses the frame with snow , fluorescent light , and human encounters that match the melancholic beauty of the frame . With Game 6 and this film , Keaton has proved to be one of our most reliable and literate actors . He is also a knockout director . \*\*\*\* " ,8
" Patience is a virtue and this film has virtues aplenty . I have a confession : I adore Kelly Macdonald 's Scottish accent . It makes me go all weak in the knees , sends my heart aflutter . She is the reason I went to see The Merry Gentleman . I like Michael Keaton , too , and thought his performance in Game 6 -LRB- 2005 -RRB- was exceptionally good . I was n't too sure how good a director he would be , but after watching The Merry Gentleman , I can safely say that Keaton is a very good filmmaker . The story of The Merry Gentleman could very well point to all the trappings of a formula : An abused woman inadvertently sees a hit man and then he befriends her with obvious intent . Given filmmakers ' penchant these days to turn this sort of subject matter into yet another Tarantino or Guy Ritchie clone , the calmness with which The Merry Gentleman unfolds comes as a wonderful surprise . I realize that film-goers who want to see every hit man movie turned into another fast-talking Tarantino imitation might be sorely disappointed or even bored by The Merry Gentleman . This film takes its time . It 's in no hurry to get where it 's going and it does n't pander to its audience with needless bloodshed , non sequitur riffs or slam-bang car chases . This film might be about a hit man and the witness , but it is not an action film . This really is a splendid character study , paced deliberately so that we would get to know , understand , appreciate and grow to love these people . This film relies on its two main characters , Frank -LRB- Keaton -RRB- and Kate -LRB- Macdonald -RRB- , to carry the film . And these two fine actors do not disappoint . Their scenes together are strikingly powerful , even when they say little . And there are many such moments in this film . Even their meet-cute , which could very well have turned into a typically corny moment , is handled with grace , charm and just enough humor to make you smile . This is a drama about human connections , more than anything else . An unconventional love story as Frank and Kate , a depressed professional killer and the mousy abused woman , slowly work their way through each other lives , through the uncomfortable moments , trying to steal moments they can share . Keaton could very easily have played Frank for a chuckle or two , given him a frenetic edge , as he often has in films . Instead , he plays him low-key . Perhaps too low-key , some could argue , but that is what I loved about his character . He really is more than a man struggling with the morality of what he does ; he 's a man struggling with life and all its vagaries . What he does for a living seems almost inconsequential to his struggles . Keaton finds the fine edges to his character and realizes there 's more to reveal in what Frank does n't say than in what he does . There 's nothing false about Frank 's weariness or sadness . This is truly a finely-tuned and subtle performance by Keaton - one of his very best . Macdonald is completely charming as Kate . Her glorious accent aside , she brings a delightful sweetness to her role . This is a real woman with genuine problems and we understand Frank 's desire - and even need - to take care of her . She has suffered much and it all seems so unfair that such a creature would be in such pain . Macdonald is marvelous . She has always been a remarkably astute actress capable of immediately drawing the audience to her . Just watch her in The Girl in the Cafe -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and you will promptly fall in love with her . She also gave the severely under-praised performance in No Country For Old Men -LRB- 2007 -RRB- . This is yet another wonderful performance from a terribly under-appreciated actress . Macdonald never disappoints . There are two fine supporting performances - from Bobby Cannavale as Kate 's husband , and Tom Bastounes , as a cop investigating Frank 's killings and also harboring a crush on Kate . Cannavale 's outburst seems a bit noisy for a film this solemn , but he makes it work . And Bastounes , as a not-too-tidy cop , is just priceless . His dinner scenes with Kate contain terrific bits of acting . At a time when Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , Terminator Salvation , Public Enemies and other Hollywood films gain all the attention , it is too bad that a film such as The Merry Gentleman seemingly just gets lost in the shuffle . This is a gem of a film . It is not for anyone seeking an adrenaline rush . But is for those seeking a tender , sweet , deeply moving , at times startling film about deeply damaged people and their attempts to find some sort of solace , happiness and meaning in this life . The Merry Gentleman is a richly rewarding experience for those who appreciate good movies . " ,8
" an example of performances making the biggest difference . The Merry Gentlemen has the makings , and perhaps even the trappings , of a predictable neo-noir involving a hit-man -LRB- Michael Keaton -RRB- , a detective -LRB- Bastounes -RRB- and the woman that they 're both eying -LRB- Kelly MacDonald -RRB- , and the elements of crime floating all about . But Keaton brings to the table as a first-time director an absolutely unbreakable grasp of what makes the scene -LRB- s -RRB- work from an actor 's stand-point . Ironically for an actor who usually makes his mark in movies as someone with a lot of nervous energy or something that makes him quirky or mysterious -LRB- i.e. Batman\/Bruce Wayne , Beetlejuice , Jackie Brown -RRB- , here he 's subdued , almost like Alain Deleon in Melville 's movies . He does n't say much , but when he does you listen , especially as his character Logan has pneumonia or carries a Christmas tree . On his own end Keaton 's got his character covered wonderfully . That leaves the other two , and one other actor that should be noted . MacDonald is quickly becoming an example of a perfect character actress . It 's hard for me to see her becoming a full-blown A-list star , even a decade or more after she hit the scene in her debut in Trainspotting , but when she comes into a role , usually in the supporting variety -LRB- most recently No Country for Old Men and Choke -RRB- you feel her presence incredibly . She 's so vulnerable and adorable , so keen on how her character should be in every moment , as someone who 's fragile , been messed with by her husband , but wants to have her space while at the same time being friendly to both the lonely hit-man and the desperate cop . It 's hard for me to see a flaw in her performance , and maybe helps elevate things another notch or two . Ditto for Bastounes , one of those actors you swear you 've seen somewhere else but actually has only been in one -LRB- or none -RRB- features before this . He , too , makes a mark playing off both MacDonald like at the restaurant or Keaton in a pivotal scene at the tailor . There 's another actor I should also credit , though at the moment I forget his name : he plays MacDonald 's character 's husband , and he appears out of the darkness in a scene , a recovering abuser with a newfound Jesus addiction who tries to win back his wife 's heart as she holds a knife to him . It 's one of the best , creepiest dramatic scenes I 've yet seen this year . And while I praise his and the other principles performances , the rest of the film around them is ... well , good , watchable , though nothing wholly remarkable . At times Keaton is still finding his footing with style , keeping some shots engaging and others just doing a big pan or reveal where it would n't be necessary . It 's competent work , though , and I would hope to see something else from him ; at the least he reveals himself such a fantastic director of his fellow actors -LRB- not least of which himself , though as Eastwood shows that 's easier done than said -RRB- that he may have found a new calling . It 's an A-grade acting job amid a decent little B-movie . 7.5 \/ 10 " ,7
" The Merry Gentleman : A Slice of Yellow Tail Sashimi . In a recent trend , the film going public has favored a cinematic experience of what I like to call Hand it Overs . These phenomena can be as creative as the big reveal at the end of early M. Night Shymalan films , or as effortless in reality as passing the mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving dinner . They give the majority of today 's audiences exactly what they want , instant gratification . Imagine if we never saw Malcom Crowe 's real fate completely unfold in The Sixth Sense or Elija Prince 's true self-revealed in Unbreakable . How would this change our perception and enjoyment of them ? The Merry Gentleman marks Michael Keatons Directorial debut by chance due to the sudden illness of screenwriter Ron Lazzeretti who was originally slated to Direct . Keaton also stars as Frank Logan , a depressed hit man , alongside Kate Frazier -LRB- Kelly Macdonald -RRB- a woman who has just escaped from an abusive relationship . As the plot unfolds , Frank and Kate end up mysteriously crossing paths , which spawns an unconventional , often uncomfortable and strained romance between these two mixed up individuals from different worlds . Keaton 's first shot at direction does everything but fall into a Hand It Over . His pacing is agonizingly slow , yet unbelievably careful . Discerning and seasoned viewers will appreciate his intricate placement and organization of scenes for the greater purpose , if not during the film then certainly after the credits roll . Others will become fed up with his unconventional style a third of the way through , and if they have n't walked out of the theater before the final scene may let out a strained , That 's It ? and huff out the door unsatisfied . For me it took a good fifteen minutes after the picture ended before everything clicked and I was blindsided by the sheer brilliance of what I had seen ; deep themes rich in symbolism of religion and redemption and the overall feeling that Keaton felt no responsibility as an artist to spell it out for us . Performances all around play it safe but are always believable and gratifying to watch . As a virtual no name , Macdonald holds her own quite well , even while sporting an Irish accent that can sometimes border on a tad annoying and contrived . In front of the camera , Keaton never fails to please and continues to frustrate me when I realize that he has been almost entirely absent from view since the mid nineties . Supporting cast gets the job done and Bobby Cannavale delivers a poignant , gripping and short-lived scene stealing performance as Kate 's boyfriend . The question that will remain on many of our minds is , what exactly is the fine line between complete obscurity and masterpiece , and did Keaton cross it ? That 's for each of us to decide individually , but it is in the opinion of this reviewer that said line is imaginary . As an art form , film should have no boundaries , regardless of how many cookie cutter , How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days burnt offerings Hollywood Studios continuously try to force down our throats . After all is said and done , it does feel good to sink your teeth into a double quarter pounder , but on occasion , Yellow Tail Sashima can prove to be extremely rewarding . After all , grandma always said try everything once . " ,8
" This quiet , slow moving little masterpiece is well worth watching . It 's amazing what a good group of actors can do under superior direction . I 'd almost forgotten . Usually I favor movies for their story , but this movie 's story is a bit light . Still , what 's there is made all the more engaging by the terrific performances , starting with the two leads . Kelly MacDonald is especially effective , but so is Michael Keaton who manages to bring some convincing emotional reality to the hit man genre despite having directorial duties to perform as well . The pace is slow but it 's rich with detail and nuance to the point you 'll feel as if you 're really there . Some movie scenes seem to suspend the reality of the camera and lights for those key moments , but here the entire movie seems unusually realistic and unaffected . It 's got to be Keaton 's doing which makes me hope he finds another project he 'd like to tackle soon . Saw this on DVD tonight and thoroughly enjoyed it . Not for the shallow or those only looking for a laugh . Be attentive and respectful and you 'll come away a bit better for the experience . " ,9
" A stunning surprise . Michael Keatons directorial debut is incredible . A beautifully paced film about relationships lonely people and a world of difference between occupations and normal perceptions of society . A subtle bringing together of lost souls . It reminded of Eastwoods style -- little dialogue , gestures and expressions sighs and looks counting for the shift of emotions . A dark haunting film magnificently photographed , with shadow darkness and light comprising a stunning view . Miss Mcdonald who I remember from an HBO film with Bill Nighy is simply superb in the role of a receptionist . with one fellow worker friend and a secret reason for her independence . If you want to see a real haunting film about the meaning of life and the world of humanity , I beg you to see this film . I see performances of Oscars and the best film I 've seen this year so far . " ,9
" The most poetic crime drama you 'll ever see in your miserable life . The main character does n't say a word for the first half hour . But in that half hour , if we 're paying attention , we get more insight into the depths of a man 's soul than if we had just read his 500-page autobiography . The Merry Gentleman is billed as a crime drama , but that label hardly does it justice . The same way The Spy Who Came In From the Cold broke the spy genre , the same way 2001 : A Space Odyssey broke the scifi genre , the same way Pink Floyd - The Wall ai n't no average musical , this film is anything but your average crime drama . For starters , there 's not a single car chase , gunfight , blimp explosion or any of the standard crime drama clich s. Instead , the tension suspense is masterfully built around secrets . We begin with a secret which only the main character and the audience know . Then there is a secret which the 2nd character only knows -LRB- which the audience must slowly piece together -RRB- . And finally , we have the main character 's ultimate secret which is so cryptically presented that it may take you a few days of introspection before you figure it out . This film is very much like a challenging poem whose meaning is elusive at first glance but whose mood style sinks into your mind over time . Dialogue is sparse , but every line packs a whollop . In particular , pay attention to the analogy of ghosts angels which crops up several times both verbally visually . One of the characters says something like Ghosts and angels are the same , except ghosts are haunted while angels are blessed . OK , it may not mean much at first , but by the end of the film the significance is absolutely beautiful . Which brings me to the cinematography : absolutely beautiful . I 'm no film school student , but I know what images affect me , and these scenes certainly did . Contrast -LRB- gleaming white snowflakes at night -RRB- , perspective -LRB- long corridors at the morgue -RRB- , symmetry -LRB- a lonely theater marquee -RRB- and surrealism -LRB- a Christmas tree burning in a wheat field -RRB- are just some of the artistic touches you have in store . I can honestly say that I can not think of a finer directoral debut than Michael Keaton in The Merry Gentleman . I wo n't even get into the first rate acting , the haunting musical score , or Katie 's adorable accent . This movie is just about perfect . The only reason why I 'm giving it only 8 stars instead of 10 is that I 'm a real hardass . By the way , DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER . DO NOT READ THE DVD DESCRIPTION . AVOID ALL DISCUSSION OF PLOT . This movie is best enjoyed if you know absolutely nothing about the story . The challenge -LRB- and the fun -RRB- will be even greater . " ,8
" Slow but very good . Frank Logan -LRB- Keaton -RRB- is a hit man and he suspects Kate -LRB- MacDonald -RRB- can place him at the scene of his last hit . This is slow moving , but if you look at it as a cat and mouse game it 's a non-issue . The thing that really saves this movie is Kate 's Scottish accent . You can not get enough of it regardless or what else is going on . Okay , the movie would save itself anyway , but when Kate speaks , you listen because you really do n't know anything about her , and that accent is pure heaven . Maybe it is the accent . The title is somewhat misleading . There is nothing merry about Frank Logan as you will see . Merry is used because it is Christmas time and he does act the part of a gentleman . See ? Seems it is all a matter of some misdirection , but only in the title , not in the story . This is Michael Keaton 's first attempt at directing and since I enjoyed the movie , I 'd say he did a good job of it . He brought the right amount of suspense and tension throughout the story . And , to have selected Kelly MacDonald to play Kate , with that accent is pure genius . I guess you can tell I really like the Scottish accent . Violence : Yes . Sex : No . Nudity : No . Language : Yes , some " ,7
" creativity at its best . As other reviews have pointed out , this is a movie which should be seen and experienced , instead of reading reviews and narratives about it . This is one of the most enchanting and underrated movie that I have ever seen . It simply transcends movie-making to another level . It is evident that Keaton is a sensitive director , and daring in the sense that he does not try to hide this fact . The characters of the movie have depth . Breathtaking cinematography coupled with an amazing soundtrack makes this movie enjoyable . Where this movie stands out from the usual fare is that it does not try to build up a story or a narrative , instead the characters go with the flow with no attempt to explain any quirks along the way . Which is how life actually is ! Kudos to Keaton for bringing out such a wonderful film . I wish I could treat myself to this movie for the first time again . " ,10
" Lots of good things about this movie . Here are the good things about this movie : Dialogue . The dialogue is very realistic . I was shouting the same exact responses the characters did BEFORE they spoke them . Continuity\/editing : Someone was paying real close attention . I ca n't remember seeing such perfect continuity . The two cops confabbing in the car is a perfect example . Camera work : as an example , the church scene is nice and wide which equals powerful . Pace : the pace was spot-on for this story . The pace matched the characters , their actions , and motives . The story : the story was a nice little slice of life . The Merry Gentleman almost reminded me of a foreign flick . Hey , maybe Keaton has started a new genre : Formerican . Michael Keaton : His body language , his walk , and his facial expressions were an asset to his character . One exception : that was n't you Michael walking away on the grass . I could tell . I needed to know that was you walking away . Clearly , it was not . You used a body double and that was a big let down . The other actors : Nice ensemble who all worked well and off one another . Okay , a woman sees a man on the top of a building after he 's just made a hit . Who cares if you can figure out what 's going to happen next , or to whom ? Is that why we watch movies ? To be brilliant ? Look , it 's not the story that drives The Merry Gentleman . It 's the characters . And those who said they do n't care about the characters - perhaps you do n't care in the way you care whether Chief Brody makes it out of the ocean alive - but you care . Or at least , you 're curious . The two things I do n't like : 1 . The title . 2 . The DVD cover photo . Watch this movie because Michael Keaton did many satisfying things creating and telling the story Hopefully , we 'll see more of him as a director and an actor . He Michael , do you read any unsolicited scripts ? " ,9
" Protecting Kelly MacDonald . Kelly MacDonald has that quality about her that pulls the male ego into wanting to protect her . I felt it in The Girl in the Cafe , and I 'll never forgive Javier Bardem for keeping his vow in No Country for Old Men . The Merry Gentleman could be titled Who will Protect Kelly ? Will it be the cop , the hit-man -LRB- Keaton -RRB- even her born-again husband ? - they all want to protect her . Her husband is insane , and the cop offends her every time he speaks . Cold-blooded murderer Logan -LRB- Keaton -RRB- , seems to win her heart with coughs , wheezing and repeating twice I found a girl under a Xmas tree . Keaton 's minimalist dialog even has him wheezing for her to quit talking and leave the hospital . If he charms her with any more silver-tongued devilry than that , it must have been edited out . I thought the ending worked ; the part that was missing was ` What did she see in him ? ' " ,4
" Undeveloped Lead with Simply Too Many Holes to Grab Your Attention . I applaud Keaton for taking his shot behind the camera . However , when I watched the film , I did not know he had directed it . But sometimes , as an audience member , you simply get the feeling about 10-15 minutes in , that you may not in very reliable , or skilled hands . That was the case with The Merry Gentleman . The problems mainly lay with the script . There are FAR too many improbabilities and convenient coincidences in the story to make it believable , and these start to become more and more noticeable as the film goes on . By the time I got half-way through the film , I still did n't have much of an idea of what the central motive of either character was , especially Michael Keaton , and after awhile , I began to stop caring . Michael Keaton plays a professional hit-man , though we never know for who , or why , or even anything about his targets . All we know is that he appears to be terribly sad about it . He is suicidal -LRB- the way his first attempt is foiled is practically out of a Buster Keaton comedy -RRB- , but I would think that a character who was a professional hit-man would come up with far simpler and effective methods to off himself than the ones he attempts in the movie . A gun , maybe ? Also , if he 's so tortured about what he does , would n't make sense for him to kill himself BEFORE you completes another job ?? We never really find out much about this character as he slowly moves through the film mumbling a word here or a word there . Even in a scene in a hospital scene that appears to be inserted into the film to try and give the audience some idea of who this character is , we still get nothing ... and that nothing takes a whole lot of time to get to . There is a strange plot twist in the 2nd half of the film , where writer tries to tie up the loose end of the abusive husband . All I can say is that it involves yet another convenient coincidence involving a business card to a local hotel . Kelly McDonald , a fine actress , is really the lead of the film , but even here the writer did n't give her character much logic to work with . The film opens with her leaving her abusive husband after he gives her a nasty shiner . Somehow , within a few days , she is suddenly in a new city , with a new job . Just like that . How this all happened , again is a mystery . Even though the black eye is something she 'd rather hide and not talk about , she bizarrely shows up at an office Christmas party where she certainly must know that she 'll be asked about it repeatedly -LRB- which , of course , she is -RRB- . Obviously not wanting to jump into any new relationships due to her abusive past , she rejects the advances of a few of her new co - workers , but then inexplicably falls for Michael Keaton 's character after one brief run-in , who , in their first meeting , comes off as a bit , well ... creepy . For a smart girl , she also seems completely clueless that a police officer investigating a case she 's involved in as a witness , is interested in her romantically . The light takes a while to go on apparently . All and all , there 's never enough of anyone 's life to really dig into , but more a 2-dimensional picture of it all . The look and tone of the film is a bit of a mess . There is a slew of completely unmotivated camera moves and cuts that defy all logic , almost as if Keaton was terrified of having the film look too plain . As a result , it winds up being a mishmash of different styles that belong in a dozen different films . This could also be said of the mind-boggling score and music cues . In the end , it seems like the film really did n't know what it wanted to be ; sometimes a gritty drama , sometimes a Billy Wilder comedy , sometimes a teary melodrama , and sometimes a Basic Instinct-type thriller . Though the last 20 minutes of the film do actually do manage to build some tension through proper pacing , the ending is simply befuddling . There 's a difference between leaving an ending open because you want to challenge the audience into thinking about what might happen , and leaving an ending open because you simply ca n't come up with a proper or satisfying one . I can only imagine that this film got made because the writer knew Keaton , Keaton signed on to play the -LRB- quite undeveloped -RRB- lead role , and the financing followed from there . " ,3
" Awkward ... . This very simple tale aims for a feel similar to a Coen brothers noir-ish film but the actual craftsmanship and writing is not up to the task . The premise is that of two loners who have nothing in common but nonetheless bound together . One character is a hit-man , played by director Michael Keaton . The other is Kate , a woman fleeing a past of abuse , played by Kelly MacDonald . Unfortunately , there 's nothing here to rejuvenate the classic elements such as the nice-guy - hit-man who is poorly socialized . The quirky relationships falls a little flat compared to other movies of the genre . Everybody will root for poor Kate to get her life on track after a bad relationship , I could n't help but feel it all tied up a little nicely for her . There 's just nothing terribly interesting about this plot or the characters to make me care " ,4
" Avoid . . I feel that , even though I really do n't want to , I should maybe watch this film again - to maybe see if I missed out any important details or something because from my experience this film has very little to redeem its creation . Frankly , I 'd rather the film did n't make any money so that would teach Michael Keaton a lesson . Kelly McDonald 's in it - and her character does n't do any favors to get the audience to empathise or sympathise in any way with her . Likewise , Michael Keaton the retired hit-man love interest out to do one last job is unengaging and wooden . The only portions of the film I enjoyed were most of the scenes involving the fat cop -LRB- who fancies Kelly -RRB- because he actually manages to act unlike the rest of the cast . In addition , the first twenty minutes of the film where Keaton sneaks about town doing ` hitmanny stuff ' is all very well arranged and is admittedly kind of cool - yet this twenty minutes does not in any way reflect the tone nor the level of quality you should expect from the rest of the film following it . I did n't get it . " ,4
" Mix Batman and a Christmas story and ... . ... it had the potential to work . Combine it with an actor who apparently wants to make one of those films you can tell is specifically created for Oscar award nomination and ends up being clich and simplistic and you get clich , simplistic , and unrealistic . At times it did work . But I think this is a case where the director -LRB- also a primary actor in the story -RRB- got himself too involved and lost perspective . You could also say this mixes the various sniper\/killer films popular at the moment with an xmas film . Either way , the end product would have benefited immensely from someone reviewing it who was n't personally involved in the film and a bit more plot development . " ,3
" OK but nothing great ... . . Ca n't say I would have much faith in a bunch of scientists that come to survey the devastation reaped on the West Coast of Ireland but are so ` clever ' that they fail to notice that the surveying instrument they are using does NOT have a battery . Admittedly I use this sort of gear all the time and do tend to notice minor details like whether or not I can actually turn it on or not but this crack team of experts seemed to miss that . Bet they felt silly when they got back to their base and found that all their work was lost cos they were too dumb to notice something as obvious . Not a bad film but some of the accents were a bit odd to say the least ... . and why is it that America always takes charge whenever Earth is threatened ... that would terrify me more than the bloody comet. :-RRB- " ,4
" Why I liked this movie ... . To date , 20 % of people who voted on this movie gave it a 9 or a 10 . I was one of them , and I would like to elaborate on the reasons why : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The movie attempts to be realistic . The scenario it describes , broadly , is not impossible . Tomorrow might be the day we learn about `` Ireland-type '' impact as shown in the movie -LRB- I am not an expert on this , but my understanding is that it is true that sufficiently small objects can be detected only too late for any action to be taken -RRB- . I like that there are no super heroes in this movie and no futuristic technology -LRB- although the timing might be off on some elements of the story -RRB- . On other hand , as other comments mention , there appear to be many goofs , some of which are quite embarrassing ; and the more technical one goes , probably , the more one finds . For myself , only a moderately critical viewer , however , this did not create mental blocks to enjoying the film . -LRB- 2 -RRB- The movie underlines the importance of the development of technology and investment in outerspace \/ NEO exploration . In a scenario like this , no data is excessive and no technical capability of humanity is wasteful . From my very subjective perspective , space exploration is one direction of human effort that is bound to pay off in one way or another -LRB- and the movie highlights just one of the ways -RRB- . My hope is that publicity to the topic and the field will create greater awareness of this in general public and will bring in more converts . -LRB- 3 -RRB- The movie highlights the `` higher self '' of the United States , as a country , nation , and culture - the notion that a nation can sacrifice itself for the good of the humanity . From a sarcastic perspective , I guess , this can be the most unrealistic part about the movie , but I , personally , do n't adhere to this . More than that , I think that most nations and people would do the same if given a chance . In a way , the movie highlights the `` higher self '' of humanity , which we tend to loose sight of in daily life . Personally , this was the inspiring part about the movie . I bought this movie at an impulse and later , at home , was very disappointed to find out that it had under 5 average rating on IMDb . I almost did not watch the movie to not waste the time . I did eventually , on a mood upswing , and am very glad I did - it resonated with me . I hope some other people will enjoy it too ! " ,10
" Entertaining Educational Production . Geographic goofs aside , this film is fairly good . It is essentially an educational piece platformed on a drama with multi-dimensional characters moving the action along as they provide enlightening information about such a likelihood . It addresses some of the public notions of what would happen and why and makes the distinction between what we 've seen in Hollywood portrayals and what scientists know to be likely , especially with regard to prediction and intervention . The science is pretty accurate and the mood is one of the inevitable . It 's not a matter of IF but WHEN a NEO strikes Earth . The production is British but they put the object strike at Pittsburgh , my hometown . I was a bit amused . Why Pittsburgh ? " ,9
" Stinkerooni . I watched this last night . Awful , but sometimes really bad is really good . Low points : - Bad North American accents by British actors . You might fool Britons , but not North Americans . The Chief of Defense staff sounded like he had a stroke , and I loved the guy with the overacted Southern drawl . - Unrealistic . A whole bunch of scientists detected the comet at a number of different places , but only our hero scientist can break the news to the world . I could go on . - The U.S. government is relying on the scientific advice of two scientists , even though the end of the world is about to happen . Maybe ask a few others for opinions , you know ? - After six weeks of evacuations , there are still people waiting at the airport when the big day comes . - Bad science and bad script . Could 've used a scientific adviser AND a script adviser . Too many science errors to count , poor character development with weird dialog . - Poor U.S. , taking one for the team . The comet hit near Lake Ontario , which would have taken out about an area in Canada that supports about half the population -LRB- works out to about 16 million people -RRB- . Remember Canada ? It 's the world 's second-largest country by area , is about half of North America , and shares a queen with England . Darn Colonials . " ,1
" It would be laughable if it would n't be so boring . This movie is usually bad when it comes to scientific merits . Comets are not NEO -LRB- Near Earth Objects -RRB- but this movie should probably act as an advertising for NEO funding so it is acceptable . The timescales of actions are incredible - there is no way to send a probe to incoming comet in the matter of months . The comet seems round so it is fragile - just ridiculous . And again there is old song if we should or should not use nuclear devices to blast the comet off its trajectory . The super scientific mind is even scared that the blast could actually deflect other incoming warheads back to the Earth atmosphere . Oh my . That 's too much ! I think that all these pathetic school dropouts travel to Hollywood to offer their skills to write scientific scripts as this one . There is no other explanation of never ending train of stupidity in such movies . The serious scientist should really protest because some poor viewers could actually admire scientific value in such crappy movies . The movie is unfortunately not only bad , but it is also so stuffed with clich s that it is boring . The female flight attendant is not only attractive but also willing to move in to the best scientific mind . The logistic overseer is able to move 100 + million people but somehow unable to arrange evacuation of scientists and himself . All the important guys do not want to leave their command post so they have to run as hell to catch the very last plane only when the remaining people here start to act as if it was the last plane from Stalingrad . And of course , the attractive female flight attendant is here on the plane ... This is probably meant to show , you know , some action or urgency or something . Yawn . Seriously , fire all the script writers and buy some automated script writing software from Google . The result can not be possibly worse than this . It does not matter which horrible thing threatens the US or if the countermeasures fail or save the day - all these catastrophic thrillers are so soulless , so generic , so pointless and so bad . If you do like astronomy you should avoid such crap because it will misinform you and repulse you from the actual science that is way more interesting and thrilling that these bad sci-fi thrillers .

" When did they move Dublin ?? . I just watched Impact Earth and was really surprised to see that Dublin , the capital city of my fair country , has moved ! Yes , you heard me Dublin has relocated to the North of Ireland and is now roughly where Belfast is . -LRB- Maybe Miss South Carolina was the geography consultant on this movie ? -RRB- As if that is n't bad enough the Irish ` science ' people in this movie are from Queens College Dublin . Note to the writer\/director\/producer - many Irish people are a bit tetchy about the subject of the British monarchy and would really not appreciate our main educational institution named after their queen . Folks maybe before your next movie you might check out the geographic and socio-political facts , eh ? " ,4
" Shannon ??? . Folks I live 10 miles from Shannon airport and I can tell you this - it is not located in Galway Bay and does not have a seaside beach . This show puts it about 50 miles from where it actually is . A small bit of research , say looking at a map , would 've cleared this up . Dublin is not in north county Louth by the way and Queens University is not in Dublin , it is in Belfast . The very notion of an Irish university named after a British royal is insulting . The building used in the closeup shot is Dublin Castle . I like the new spin on America saving the world by the way . America takes one for the team i.e the rest of the world . An awful pile of rubbish this was . " ,2
" Best one yet . This episode was simply exhilarating . It has been a long time since we last had some insight into John Locke 's character . We finally learn how he ended up in that wheelchair and we figure out that he and Ben have many connections and similar feelings about the island . In addition , the ending is amazing and it foreshadows more interesting things to come . Also , in this episode , we witness Locke in a mood which we have never seen before . He is frustrated and has a goal to reach . He also feels very frustrated that Ben can guess his thoughts . This improves this episode 's plot .

The Man From Tallahassee is a great episode centered in John Locke , disclosing how he ended in a wheelchair and his innermost fears and feelings . On the other side , the personality and Machiavellian character of Ben Linus reveal his unusual intelligence and power of manipulating people . Ben 's attitude , strategies and actions recalled me the contents of the books The Prince and Art of War , using the adverse situation to overcome and defeat his opponents . The last scene increases the mystery of the island and leaves us , fans of this magnificent series , anxiously expecting for the next episode . My vote is nine .

" Two giant hamsters running on a massive wheel . Jack Bender directs a battle of wits between Ben Linus and John Locke . Yep , you guessed it : a great LOST episode . Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn are arguably the two best actors in the series , and they have a way of elevating the already well-written dialogue even higher through their intonations and facial expressions . Add the revealing Locke-centered flashbacks , which begin with a brilliant misdirection about his `` disability '' and contain the biggest shock since the bus scene from `` Not In Portland '' , and you have the best of the first 13 Season 3 episodes , along with `` Flashes Before Your Eyes '' . And I have n't even mentioned the look on Jack 's face when he finds out why Locke was `` sorry '' , or the look on Alex 's face when Sayid tells her that she looks like her mother . \*\*\* 1\/2 out of 4 .

" HK Neo Reviews : Forest of Death . Is The Eye an act of fluke probably Sometimes it really makes you wonder whether or not The Eye is really directed by the Pang brothers . After the mentioned award wining and international success , the Pang brothers are plainly just slightly average and at times seemingly average . As someone used to claim , the Pang brothers have a great eye and most certainly they do . Their style is always over substance , but lately they have been too concerned with style and almost forgetting the importance of having substance as well . With Forest of Death , there are moments and times that remind us what the hell the Pang brothers are capable of and namely almost all the scenes within the forest . The forest is a frightening premise and its mysterious backdrop certainly help the cause , but this is still no The Eye and the result is an adequate film that is above average . All of the sudden , Neo remembered someone asking him ages ago , what are you scared of . At that moment , I could not think of an answer , but it is certainly the forest . There is something scary and mysterious about being struck in the forest at night . The trees and eerie moments of segmented silent create an outstanding backdrop for a horror thriller . Pang smartly exploited this mysterious environment and combining with their great eye , has certainly created something watch-able and even thrilling at times . Shu Qi is certainly a capable actress , but it seems that she have forgotten about her potential to become even better and in the process her acting range seemed to have been stalled . It is disappointing to see Shu Qi taking the same role and approaching it in the same manner over and over again . It is an okay performance , but it is no where near her previous outing with the Pang brothers in The Eye 2 . Another person that should be up for similar criticism is Ekin Cheng . Cheng have never been much of a talent when it comes to acting , and apart from maturing from his Young and Dangerous days , he have been appearing in more and more stoic roles after roles . He does not show any sort of range and in turn lamenting out an unsympathetic performance that hardly ever relate to the audience . On the other hand , Rain Li continues to impress Neo with both her beauty and potential she is showing . She seemed to be the only character that is somewhat human and she handles the rain dreaded scenes within the forest alone with some degree of distinction . However , the scene stealer must be veteran Lau Siu Ming whose mysteriousness makes the film better than it should be . All in all , Forest of Death is an interesting premise and the backdrop of the forest certainly plays a role in the overall mysteriousness within the flick . However , it is once again the flaw in Pang brothers filmmaking in the over emphasis in terms of style over substance . In fact it is okay to have style over substance , but it is not adequate when you have 90 % on style and 10 % on substance , as the result is the audience feeling pretty much empty . It is an adequate enough effort to justify a viewing , but with the Pang brothers , you really expect more than that . Perhaps it is now safe to say that The Eye was a one off fluke , but lets not give up just yet and hopefully the Pang brothers can once again prove me wrong I rate it 7\/10 . - www.thehkneo.com " ,7
" The Chinese are making bombs !!! . ... and I do n't mean nuclear !! This movie is proof that the Chinese are not the greatest filmmakers by a long shot .

" City of Ember Movie Review from The Massie Twins . City of Ember employs a supremely majestic setting to unravel its end-of-the-world sci-fi adventure , but several missed opportunities keep it from escaping its family-friendly roller coaster ride feel and becoming something truly unique . However , a few too-convenient outcomes and a rushed introduction ca n't take away the undeniable enjoyment of solving the epic mystery of the once-grand city with the two enthusiastic leads . When the world ended , a group of elite scientists and engineers determined that the only way to save their way of life was to build an underground city far below the decimated surface . Deciding upon a lifespan of 200 years for their city , the key to salvation was locked away in a metal box to be handed down from one mayor to the next until the time was right . But somewhere along the way the box was forgotten Years and years have passed and the once mighty City of Ember steadily falters as corrupt officials dictate an antiquated way of life and the massive generator that powers the city frequently fails . Now it is up to two ambitious youths , Doon Harrow -LRB- Harry Treadaway -RRB- and Lina Mayfleet -LRB- Saoirse Ronan -RRB- to solve the mystery behind the origins of their city and find a way out before their world is blanketed in darkness forever . Easily the most impressive piece of the City of Ember puzzle is the delightfully ominous science-fiction visuals . The massive sets were built in Northern Ireland in the shipyard-turned-soundstage of the location the Titanic was actually constructed in -LRB- now the largest soundstage in the world -RRB- and it 's never more apparent than in the beautiful crane shots through the underground city . The CG elements are also top-notch , but the practical effects flawlessly immerse the audience in the fantasy world of pipeworks and generators . While the setting is brilliantly realized , the characters that populate the grandiose city receive far too little development . The introduction and relationship between the two main characters feels truncated and never really furthers as the story progresses , and the origins of each remain as enigmatic as that of the shining city . The adult characters throughout never provide as much support as they should to enhance the understanding and motives behind the city 's cryptic suppression . At least Bill Murray hams it up as the gluttonous mayor with a devious agenda of his own . Like something blended from a video game universe -LRB- Bioshock in particular -RRB- and 12 Monkeys ' post-apocalyptic subterranean sewer-world -LRB- or even Terminator 's hypogeal bomb shelters -RRB- , City of Ember packs adventure and intrigue into the wondrous exploration of a society crumbling from age and deceit . As the young heroes scour the dank passages and forgotten tunnels , it 's difficult not to become immersed in the fun of uncovering clues and discovering secrets alongside the venturous duo . - The Massie Twins " ,7
" well , I quite liked it . I 've read quite a few negative reviews but i think some of the people who have read the book need to realize this was a children 's film that would no doubt have to be simplified and draw people in from the start . It has n't had an easy launch either because it 's been competing with High School Musical 3 , when i went to see it the cinema was empty apart from me because everyone else had gone to see a certain other film . It was n't great and i am certain that if i had read the book i would have hated it because the characters were not brilliantly written and it was a messy mix of excellent fantasy sci-fi with the appropriate special effects and corny American generic children 's movie . But it was good fun . The girl in it displayed a superb acting performance the general set and costumes and well mise-en-scene in general was excellent and well worth watching just for that . It was good to watch in the cinema and throughly enjoyable if a bit predictable . As i say , generally i liked it . " ,8
" Very good movie . I was n't expecting much from this film , but I ended up loving it quite a bit . It 's a great kid 's adventure , lots of mystery and action , good character development , and plenty of cool settings . Bill Murray and Tim Robbins do a fine job in their roles , but they are mostly supporting cast . It 's the two kids who are the real heart of the story . I also love how the filmmakers created an entirely plausible distant future where beauty still thrived despite crumbling infrastructure . Above all , this is a movie about hope for the future . If you are looking for a good adventure similar to THE GOONIES , check this out . Great for kids , and great for folks of all ages who enjoy light adventure . " ,10
" A solid family film . . When moving from book to motion picture , there are a myriad of problems associated with such a task , one of which comes from those die hard fans of the original story . Fortunately for myself I have never taken it upon myself to read the source material on which this movie is based upon , nor had I even heard of it until now . As a result I found City of Ember to be a gratifying and sensually enticing experience with brilliant performances , an endlessly captivating story and pace , and a great mix of fantastical environments and characters which pave way for subtext that is grounded in simple allegory of our own , current world . To be sure , there are moments when the film dabbles in and out of tired clich s , most of which we have seen countless times this year alone in other children 's adventures ; yet what distinguishes this from , say , The Chronicles of Narnia or The Spiderwick Chronicles is through its mature themes and presentation that keeps the older viewer in mind . In this respect , City of Ember is a solid family film that most audiences should enjoy regardless of age , gender or anything else ; good entertainment , and a wonderful story to remember at that . Taking place almost exclusively within the confines of Ember , Gil Kenan here presents us with a vision of a dystopian future , where mankind has been forced to live underground in order to survive . Set many years on from this event however , much of the inhabitants of Ember are unaware of their origin and all the more scared of it as a result . However , in a time of desperation , two citizens Doon Harrow -LRB- Harry Treadaway -RRB- and Lina Mayfleet -LRB- Saoirse Ronan -RRB- go on their own quest to try and find an exit from the underground city , which does n't go down well with gluttonous Mayor Cole -LRB- Bill Murray -RRB- who just wants his next meal in peace . What follows from here is a story that is n't entirely unfamiliar -LRB- in fact , it 's dangerously close to this year 's WALL-E -RRB- , and yet director Gil Kenan manages to take the script and turn it into his own compelling take on a tried and trusted concept . From the arresting opening monologue to the somewhat anti-climatic ending , there is barely a spot here that feels out of place or contrived for the sake of playing to the camera . The pacing , particularly during the middle act , could have been a little tighter , and you often get the sense that there 's a lot of footage missing from this cinematic cut , yet as a whole , City of Ember does enough , and with the right amount of originality in tact , to cover up the rough edges . The ending , as I stated , is a little underwhelming and all too brief , but it at least feels coherent and natural to that which comes before it . If there 's one thing that Kenan manages to get across here however , it is the imagination and vision that is present in the script and story . Immediately , and most strikingly poignant during the opening sequence , the City of Ember itself is a sight to behold ; from the countless lightbulbs that give the city its light to the murky tunnels that run underneath to provide water , the production values present are superb . Furthermore , the special effects work , although a little obvious during certain sequences involving humans , is noticeably strong ; particularly when a giant mole-like creature appears . Not only does the creature look disgusting and completely frightening , but the director does well to stage the beast in such a way as to bring out its realistic characteristics ; saying that I got flashbacks of Jurassic Park 's raptors scene and a few from Aliens certainly would n't be a negative link to make . Yet as good as the CGI actors are , thankfully the more traditional skin and bones performers are n't so bad themselves . As Hollywood unknowns -LRB- to an extent -RRB- Saoirse Ronan and Harry Treadaway give convincing performances in their lead positions and very rarely give attention to their ages . Sure enough , their roles are n't the most demanding of jobs , but despite their characters ' underwritten nature both fulfil the requirements of leads nicely and with enough conviction to consistently carry the film forward . Of course , it 's always good to have a familiar face around , and Bill Murray , playing the obnoxious and gluttonous slob Mayor Cole , is the one to provide such a role . Murray , although arguably underused as far as his talents go , does well to establish a character that nobody is necessarily going to warm to , and uses whatever screen time he has adequately to further the movie on and to back up his lead performers . In the end however , all these elements simply come together to create one thing ; an adventure . As just that , City of Ember is a very strong and convincing effort from director Gil Kenan who makes his live-action debut here . Sure enough there are countless rough edges present , and characters , although compelling in their quest , fail to resonate emotionally , but the overall adventure itself that is , the tale is one that will be sure to captivate imaginations and the attentions of many diverse audiences . With stunning visuals that complement the script 's wonderful sense of imagination , fitting performances , and a very memorable , intelligent and socially relevant story , City of Ember is a fantastic slice of entertainment for all the family to enjoy . - A review by Jamie Robert Ward -LRB- http:\/\/www.invocus.net -RRB- " ,8
" Decent Film With Good Characters Sets , But A Little Too-Little , Too-Late . Overall , this was an `` okay '' film ; not bad , but nothing that memorable . I enjoyed the sets of the subterranean city and the teen kids were likable , but it took a little long before anything happened and when it did it was a little too far-fetched with poor special-effects . Nonetheless , the visuals and acting were fine and supporting performances by the always-goofy Bill Murray and Tim Robbins were somewhat entertaining . The most intriguing actor , to me , was Saoirse Ronan , as `` Lina Mayfleet . '' At first she minded me a bit of Peggy Ann Garner in `` A Tree Grows In Brooklyn , '' but maybe two years older . Ronan has a plain but expressive and intelligent face , a la a very young Cate Blanchett . She looks like she 's on her way to a good career . Her counterpart , the male teen `` Doon Harrow , '' was played nicely by Harry Treadaway . Although it 's a nice , safe family film , I think a lot of kids will be bored by the time anything happens , and adults will be so-so on it . I stuck around for the visuals , mainly , but was disappointed in how amateurish the action scenes in the last 20 minutes looked . " ,7
" Young actors save the day for the city . `` City of Ember '' , director Gil Kenan 's follow up to his horror-lite for preteens `` Monster House '' , is a fun ride that 's well worth the admission price if only for the superb production design and the likable leads . Lina Mayfleet -LRB- Saoirse Ronan -RRB- and Doon Harrow -LRB- Harry Treadaway -RRB- are two of the inhabitants of the City of Ember - an underground city designed to house humans for two centuries as an unspecified disaster takes place on the surface . But as the 200 years have passed , the generator that powers the city gradually falters , causing more frequent blackouts and scarce provisions . When no one would listen to them , especially the city mayor - Mayor Cole -LRB- the effective yet underused Bill Murray -RRB- - it then becomes up to Lina and Doon to find the exit that leads to the surface , which is infinitely easier in theory than in practice , considering the plethora of puzzles and riddles they would have to solve . Without having read the film 's source material - Jeanne Duprau 's novel - there 's no way I can say if the script holds up to the narrative of its literary counterpart , but here 's where the film mainly falters . The film feels like a rushed end product crammed to fit within the confines of a typical family flick . Exposition is kept in the sidelines and character development seems more of a ploy to advance the plot than genuine attempts in sculpting something more than cardboard-cut supporting characters . But despite the narrative faults , Kenan imbues such a magical quality to the dank environment . And for a film lacking impressive turns from its more mature and established actors -LRB- including Tim Robbins as Doon 's father -RRB- , upcoming stars Ronan and Treadaway 's animated performances save the day , right from a sweeping introduction of the claustrophobic city to a touching finale that finally affirms the characters ' quest for light amidst the darkness . " ,8
" Flawed ... but with enough of its own to separate it from the flock . Had some trouble deciding my rating on this one . There is much about it to like , for sure , but there are also some flaws that cant be overlooked . It has great setting and atmosphere , an intriguing plot and charm to boot . Such things scores a lot with me . The directing is at times questionable though , there is little sense of pacing and there are some parts that feel tacked on -LRB- the crazy flumride anybody -RRB- just because its supposed to be a summerfranchie . The cute little girl is completely superfluous , and Bill Murray and Treadaway 's Doon does n't make enough with their characters -LRB- or is n't allowed too -RRB- . One thing is clear . Its strenghs of this film mostly resides within the source material -LRB- witch i have n't read though -RRB- . Its really nice for a change to see a fantasy film without a lot of monsters , the enemies here are brain-stagnation , greed and selfishness . Some parts had me snickering . The parts where they are handed there jobs through lottery -LRB- a jab at communism ? -RRB- and the old man with the pipes . THe story is actually pretty good , not original , but tightly woven and deceivingly fresh with a timely message . In short , the source-material had the brains , but the director lacked the guts -LRB- or maybe just the talent , or were assasinated by his studio -RRB- too go through with it . Still , it beats the latest Narnia installment , and the latest Harry Potter too for that matter . Also , Ronan , the kid from Atonement , turns in a good performance . " ,7
" Fading Ember . At first blush , City of Ember seems like it would be a thrilling sci-fi adventure , a page out of Jules Verne 's playbook , but ultimately it fails to completely scale the dizzying heights of its creative premise . The movie does deliver some intrigue and some compelling performances -LRB- not to mention some mailed-in ones -RRB- , but huge lapses in logic that might be detected even by the youngest audience member prevent it from being the heart-stopping classic it wants to be . Some 200 years ago , life on Earth was dying , and in its waning moments great physicists , inventors , and architects designed and built a huge underground city powered by a gigantic generator . The Builders , though , possess some forethought and , assuming that someday the surface will again be inhabitable , they enclosed specific instructions for the citizens of Ember to eventually escape to the sunlight . This information was placed inside a metal box and alarmed with a 200-year timer ; by the end of that time , the Builders reasoned , the surface would be habitable . This box was then handed off from mayor to mayor for nearly 200 years . But , as might be expected , the chain broke somewhere along the way , and at present the box sits in a closet , its owner unknowing of its raison d'etre . So here we are , 200 years down the road , and the lights in Ember flicker occasionally , sometimes more than occasionally , and it 's apparent to a few that the generator 's days are numbered . Our story focuses on two children , Lina Mayfleet -LRB- Saoirse Ronan -RRB- and Doon Harrow -LRB- Harry Treadway -RRB- . At the movie 's outset , each has received his and her assigned job for life - Lina as a messenger -LRB- all verbal -RRB- , and Doon working in the pipeworks , where he hopes to find a way to save the generator . During the course of their duties , as the blackouts increase , each learns about the mysterious silver box , and they team up to decipher the tattered remnants of the exit instructions . Naturally , they run into complications with Doon 's father -LRB- Tim Robbins -RRB- and the current mayor -LRB- Bill Murray -RRB- , and just as naturally they 're eventually pursued by people who 'd just as soon no one ever figured out how to leave the dark city . For the most part , the casting is on target ; Ronan seems a lot more engaging and appealing here than she did just last year in Atonement , and Treadway , although looking like a refugee from High School Musical , is just as impressive . Robbins is excellent in a small , but pivotal role , as is Martin Landau -LRB- whatever became of him ? -RRB- as the requisite old-guy-who-sort-of-knows-stuff . The only puzzling casting is that of Murray as the town 's jovial mayor ; he seems glib and cheerful enough , but it almost feels like he 's being ironic , rather than being a part of the story . Often , this sort of approach makes for a hammy performance , but Murray 's too subtle here for pure hamminess ; he 's more like a square peg in a round hole . The lapses in logic take some willful ignorance to , well , ignore . We see various businesses and transportation , but there 's apparently no police , no cemeteries , no fresh fruit . Now , bear in mind that these people have been down there for two centuries . Sure , they have a lot of canned goods , but something tells me they 'd be in poor health after a lifetime of poor eating habits . Then there 's the fact that everyone seems clueless about the surface . I do n't mean that they do n't know what 's on it ; they do n't even know there IS a surface . Attempting to leave the city is a jailable offense , okay , but these people do n't even know there 's something to escape to . And that makes no sense right there . They have n't been down there for 2000 years , just 200 . That means approximately nine generations after the ones who first lived there , and in often there are three generations alive at any given time . So it 's not tough to imagine the tales of the outside world being orally handed down from generation to generation , tales of Super Bowls , Shakespeare , Sex and the City , and Snoopy . But apparently the first generationers vowed never to speak of their upper lives again , or something . City of Ember is pretty fascinating and not complex , meaning it 'll grab you -LRB- and , more importantly , teens and younger -RRB- and not force you to figure things out in order to keep up with the plot . Yes , there are twists and turns , but there are n't huge lapses in logic , at least nothing to dissuade you from staying through to the end . The end , by the way , is satisfying , even beautifully rendered . This might be one time -LRB- of many -RRB- to read the book , too . Or instead . " ,7
" An Underrated Classic . This is one of those films which will probably be called a classic in 20 years while other , more successful films will be forgotten . This is one of those films like Zathura and Secret of NIMH . The set design of the film is outstanding and it makes scenery like The Mayor 's Secret Food Store and The Generator become future iconic sets in the world . The cast is really good as well mixing legends like Tim Robbins , Bill Murray and Martin Landau with newcomers like Saorise Ronan . Martin Landau also makes the best plumber in film and his sacrifice at the end to save the main characters is brilliant . Some of the cast is underused though as Tim Robbins is in it for about ten minutes while some scenes just come out of nowhere like the Giant Killer Mole coming out to eat the main characters for waking it up and the Giant Moth with the damaged wing . The ending is also sequel baiting as well but I really hope their is a sequel as this film is really good but it made no money at all , thank you High School Musical . The book the film is based on is really good and the film follows the book really closely with only a few minor changes . The main problem with this film though is that the set is so good that the rest of the film feels underwhelming by comparison . Still that does n't mean that this is a bad film , in fact this is one of my all time favorite films . I heavily recommend it . " ,9
" Original and Engaging Adventure . In the end of mankind on Earth , the scientists build a self-sufficient underground city for a few people to preserve the human race for two hundred years . They leave also instructions for the future generations to return the surface of the planet in a steel box that should be kept by the mayors through the generations . However , the instructions are lost and the inhabitants stay in the city that is completely deteriorated . The power generator has problems and the blackouts are longer and more frequent and the city is running out of food that needs to be rationed . On the Assignment Day , the teenagers Lina Mayfleet -LRB- Saoirse Ronan -RRB- and Doon Harrow -LRB- Harry Treadaway -RRB- are assigned to work with the pipework and as messenger , but they swap their job positions . Lina , who is the descendant of the seventh mayor , finds the box of instructions in the house of her grandmother and shows it to her friend Doon . They decide to explore the way out of the city and they discover that the corrupt major and his henchmen are stealing food of the population . When they are hunted by the major 's hoodlums , they have to find the way out of Ember to survive and save the populations from the imminent darkness and end of the city . City of Ember is an original and engaging adventure and it was a great surprise for me . The dark city is a sort of combination of the environment of Brazil , the Movie and Metropolis . The cast has names like Martin Landau , Tim Robbins and a hilarious Bill Murray that performs the typical politician , corrupt , selfish and manipulative . Unfortunately the fate of politicians in real world is not the same of his character . However , the unknown Saoirse Ronan steals the movie with a great performance . It is irritating the repetitive type of review that tells the obvious -LRB- the book was better and better -RRB- . My vote is seven . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : Cidade das Sombras -LRB- City of the Shadows -RRB- " ,7
" very disappointing . Ill start out by stating that this review is coming from a fan of the novel . I 've read the book at least five times and it will forever be one of my favorite stories . when i heard that they were making a movie out of it i was on pins and needles for months waiting for it too come out . in the theater i was quickly disappointed . how could they mess it up this badly ? lets list some of the screw ups 1 . there were no robots in the book 2 . were did the giant mole and other animals come from ? 3 . what was with the escape ? they escaped in a different way then in the book . all in all , they changed so much from the original book , which was simple , engaging , and fun . the only other movie I 've been this disappointed in was eragon . avoid this movie and go read the book .

" A great children 's adventure . The best I 've seen yet ! . The film takes you into the world of a young girl -LRB- Ronan -RRB- who is living in an underground city that is falling apart . She and her friend -LRB- Treadaway -RRB- try to decifer a message left by the builders of the city that her little sister , Poppy , conveniently ripped apart . A brilliantly colored film . Fast paced and fun , you wo n't be disappointed . Ronan brings her character to life with all of the charms and pluckiness that we loved so much about Lina in the books . Bill Murray shows up as the gluttonous mayor that is the BIG VILLAIN of the whole story . Jeane DuPrau 's vision could have never been presented as good as this . A - " ,9
" A Dark Sci Fi Adventure for Young Adults . It 's hard to judge a movie on its target audience , especially if that audience is sort of a moving target . Is this movie too dark for young adults ? A.I. -LRB- 2001 -RRB- was both a family movie and a serious sci fi movie that in some ways could n't mesh for its audiences . But could a movie that resembles Spirited Away -LRB- 2001 -RRB- fantasy adventure with a bold young character but in this instance live action not animated , Goonies -LRB- 1985 -RRB- as a darkened under the earth exploration , and along with the classic sci fi escape thriller -LRB- 1971 -RRB- carry an audience of young people and their parents ? It 's hard to say . Perhaps in years to come , when young adults continue to absorb darker themes of betrayal and deception along with strength of character and hope , this movie might capture a new audience who might better appreciate its message and film experience . While the ending sequences lacks in quality special effects and seems a bit too fantastic , the movie holds together well , pacing and action and suspense are well maintained and the emotional intensity , personal connection and emotive catharsis is powerful . " ,8
" Creative fantasy adventure . My 11 year old son and I enjoyed this movie very much , perhaps because neither of us has read the book . Visually it was a treat to visit Ember , a handmade city with no cars , creative clothing and houses and a community where everyone knows you . It just looked so interesting . The movie got off to a quick start , giving just enough back-story to get the mystery of the plot going . I think it is predictable from the beginning that the kids will find a way out , but how they piece together the clues and the specifics of their escape are unravelled in exciting bits and pieces . The suspense worked on two levels - will they find the way out before the City collapses - and will they find the way out before `` the law '' stops them ? While all the actors did a fine job , I particularly enjoyed Saoirse as Lina . And the girls who played Poppy were adorable . My son said the same thing as other reviewers about the end - he would have liked to have seen the whole town pouring out into the light . " ,8
" Really quite good . . A lot of the reviewers pretty well panned this , so I actually was quite reluctant to watch it . Turned out that it was a good thing that I did , as it was quite a satisfying SF flick . The young leads are both very engaging , the set design and art direction are excellent and the whole affair is kinda suspenseful . The myriad big-name character actors are slightly distracting , particularly Bill Murray and Tim Robbins , but all turn in OK performances . I think some of the critics were a little turned off , frankly , because the movie did so very poorly at the box-office . As the years go by , I am betting that this little movie holds up a lot better than some of 2008 's big hits . " ,7
" Your ship has come in , unfortunately you 're on the way out . What the humanists among us are thinking is varied and deep . Among those same great thinkers are a group dedicated to the thought of what would happen to Mankind 's children if the ultimate disaster should strike the populations of the earth . Here is one movie which is straight out of a science fiction novel . The futuristic film is called City of Ember and purports to suggest what futuristics plan to insure survival . In this story , a group of future planners conceive , design and implement the construction of an underground city which accepts a sample of people to safeguard for a period of 200 hundred years . As always , not every contingent has been prepared for . To insure the people 's return to the surface of the planet , the instructions for said return is stored within a small metal box . Then the box is given to the Mayor of Ember and is thereafter passed on down through the generations . Like all good plans a flaw is discovered when a succeeding mayor dies without passing on the box . After two hundred years and the information stands lost , it falls to two youngsters Doon Harrow -LRB- Harry Treadaway -RRB- and Lina Mayfleet -LRB- Saoirse Ronan -RRB- to save their town . Not trusting the corrupt mayor -LRB- Bill Murray -RRB- Doon seeks his father 's -LRB- Tim Robbins -RRB- advice and help from an aging plumbing worker -LRB- Martin Landau -RRB- . The movie is an excellent vehicle for entertainment and with the addition of Landau and Murray , they accomplish that . Although the film is slightly flawed in several places , the overall movie is dramatically cohesive . Easilly recommended for adults and youngsters alike . \*\*\*\* " ,7
" One more rewrite ... . Brings to mind 1984 , Brazil , and THX #### add in a little doom and gloom -LRB- the Happening -RRB- and blame the human race for doing whatever we did to the environment to require us to run hide at depth inside the earth , and you have a bad action adventure version of Inconvenient Truth meets Journey to Center of the Earth . Did n't see Tim Robbins in the preview or I would have known better . We 've beat this global warming dead horse long enough ... how about the writers write something new and original . The movie was terribly predictable for anyone over 15 . I 'm sure many people would agree ... the instructions for escaping from the City would have been clear and know by many , and would not have involved a sixflags water slide escape taking you down to make you walk up ... Reading the subtext of the `` map '' the kids had suggested that the people were only supposed to stay in Ember for 200 years ... the supplies were obviously meant to last for less ... and many more people would have been attempting to leave or at least explore . When they finally leave the city via escape slide they go down down down ... then they walk up up up stairs to escape to the surface ... when they are at the surface they can see the city far below through a karst window -LRB- cave -RRB- yet when the generator stops they see no light in the city ... I did n't really need ten lines of text to say this movie was a lame waste of time and money . " ,1
" 2 stars for the ciniematographer . . This is the reason why I do n't like about the sci-fis these days : bad science with not much of a fiction . Everything is predictable - the good guys always got away and the bad guys got nailed . There 's no pretty girl in this movie though . Indiana Jones is a silly movie with lots of fun . This is a wanna-be ` serious movie ' without fun . Oh , the special effects - awful ! So fake and obvious , making those lousy computer games look real in comparison . It puzzles me why folks like Robbins , Landau and Murray pick a loser like this . They must be too old already . The only thing moderately interesting about the film to me is the cinematography . It 's very pleasing to watch . This is not unlike those submarine movies - need to be spacious enough not to be claustrophobic but not too much to be unreal . I love the rusty dim lit color theme as well . Alas , this is the 21 century , with all the early education through the web , wii , and everything else above and beyond , today 's youngsters are no Indiana Jones fans any more . And this one , is quite a few cut below that classic . Or shall we say , not even close ? Time wasted . Sad . " ,2
" A huge fan of the book gives his opinion . I read this book years ago for a school assignment , and it become my favorite . The plot is simple , an underground city where people were sent to be saved from the end of the world and two children find the directions out . Does n't that sound like a good plot for a NOVEL ? Which brings me to my opinion of the anticipated -LRB- for me -RRB- film adaptation of my favorite book of the year . Being as it is a movie based on the book , there will always be somethings changed . But this one stayed pretty close ... as I could point out the three or four alterations while viewing the film . I had hoped for this to become a movie for a long time , and I say to you do not listen to the low box office . It is a good film , thought predictable and screams out There 's a novel better than this ! throughout the whole film . For a fan of the novel , it 's good . " ,7
" One of the truest book adaptations I have ever seen . All in all , this is probably in my top 5 books-turned-movie . I absolutely loved the book when I read it while I was in gradeschool . Its one of those eye-opening books that makes you look at humanity in a completely different way , and so I was incredibly excited when I found out that it would be adapted into a movie . About 90 % of what happens in the movie happens in the book , and the remaining 10 % are things I would consider improvements to the book . While many people complain about the `` lack of action and adventure '' , the movie kept my interest the whole time , and there was more than one scene that caused me to hold my breath -- sure , there were no gory fight scenes , but there was plenty of suspense . I would definitely recommend this movie for all ages , as it has just the right balance of mystery , suspense , and comedy , as well as lessons that can -- and should -- be taught to everybody . " ,8
" Do not watch this movie if you 're an engineer . While the story and the scenery are fantastic in their whimsical scope , the actual technology of Ember will make anyone with even a high school physics education scratch their heads from time to time . Outside of the minor head-scratchers -LRB- no foundry\/ironworks ? how did the phones and phone lines ` deteriorate ' ? Why does everything look so weathered in an underground bunker ? -RRB- , one major flaw sticks out at me -LRB- ! MAJOR SPOILER HERE STOP ! -RRB- as the three are escaping , they exit VIA this kind of log ride DOWN several tall chutes ... yet somehow they emerge several hundred meters above the city and are able to look directly down on it . Who would build such a terrifying escape mechanism to begin with , and how do they gain all that altitude ? Overall the movie is nice , but if you have a passion for the sciences you will cringe throughout this movie almost as much as you did while watching The Core -LRB- maybe a little less -RRB- . " ,3
" One of those rare films ... . ... that I have read the book but still can enjoy the film :D I actually only wanted to give 7 or even 6 but then again I remember 1 important thing , Saoirse Ronan ! I am not a big fan of her , actually I just watch her in this movie . She is amazing as Lina , really fits her perfectly . A perfect main character is very rare nowadays in novel adaptation to movie ... For you who have read the book like me , prepare to be a little , OK maybe very disappointed by Doon . Harry Treadaway is not Doon , I feel he is too ... old . And I ca n't see that sparkle in his eyes , excitement for the pipe work job in his eyes . Nope . If only this movie were made earlier , say , 2003 ? Maybe he will suit the role , but for my taste , he is too old for this movie . City of Ember is a balance movie . No cheesy romance to ruin the real story too . The adventure is interesting , not too slow nor too scary . And it 's not too hard like some other movie with complicated explanation . So its also nice to watch with family . Light but very entertaining story . I really recommend this movie for everyone . Have or have n't read the book . For people who have read the book , it will remind us about Lina and Doon , their journey , and how creative the story created by Jeanne duPrau ! For people who have n't read the book , this movie is amazing , so you better watch it . Then , go search the book and read it !!! Maybe this film is not really popular or what , but I hope they do the sequel , People of Sparks . Because its just feel like an unfinished story ... " ,8
" Review for Science Fiction Fans . Rating for Family Audiences : 8 Rating for Science Fiction Fans : 6 I checked this movie out on the basis of some internet reviews , and to my great surprise , I was n't sorry ! Although clearly intended for family audiences , the makers managed to stick mostly to hard science fiction tenets . Some sequences towards the end were over-the-top in execution , and a couple were poorly filmed to look like a Disney World ride -- but the pieces fit together well , and the mythos was never violated . My tipsters tried to compare the set and design to various things , Mad Max , etc. . It struck \* me \* as a cross between Harry Potter and Brazil . \*\*\* BEWARE YE WHO ENTER SPOILERS , THOUGH THEY OCCUR EARLY IN FILM \*\*\* Virtually my only science fiction complaint has to do with the persistent idea that man-made apocalypse leads to gigantic animals . -LRB- This is not really a spoiler , happens early in the movie . -RRB- The kids are n't shocked or mystified enough when they get evidence of huge creatures . And the huge creatures were completely unnecessary for the plot . A half hour in , the boy actually pets a giant moth fearlessly without ever having seen one before . Duh ??? Fraggle Rock , anyone ? Did the someone watch The Island , and decide this movie also needed a moth ? Still , fun movie , watch it with your kids to teach them The American Way , and it 's much better than most sci-fi tripe . " ,7
" Well I liked it , what more can I say ? . City of Ember is n't perfect , but I personally enjoyed it , and so did my family . I admit I have n't read the book , but I am the sort of person who likes to judge adaptations on their own merits . The film does look phenomenal , the set design is intricately crafted and the costumes are beautiful . And the special effects are mind-blowing , not the best special effects ever but not the worst , far from it . The soundtrack is also rousing and fun , the story is intriguing , the script is decent and the acting is very well done . Both Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan -LRB- the better of the two -RRB- give appealing lead performances while Amy\/Catherine Quinn is very cute as Lina 's little sister Poppy . Bill Murray is deviously obnoxious as the slob of a mayor if there ever was one . However , despite the impressive visuals and performances , there are some problems . One is that while Tim Robbins is a good actor , he is given little to do as Doon 's father . Second , the ending felt rather abrupt , the film could 've done with a more rounded finish . Thirdly , the pacing is rather slow and drawn out at times particularly in the middle half . This is probably not helped by the occasionally sluggish direction . Despite these flaws , I liked City of Ember . 8\/10 Bethany Cox " ,8
" Stellar cast , phenomenal set design , and a fun story . When a film boasts a cast list comprised of some of the most talented Hollywood actors in Bill Murray , Tim Robbins , Martin Landau , and Toby Jones , not to mention newcomer and extraordinary talent Saoirse Ronan , it will most likely go one of two ways : Either the film deserves such a fine cast and will be a great film -LRB- take ` The Departed ' -LRB- 2006 -RRB- for example -RRB- ... or the cast is set in a subpar piece to make up for the film 's lesser elements -LRB- like ` Valentine 's Day ' -LRB- 2010 -RRB- -RRB- . Luckily , ` City of Ember ' falls in closer with the former instead of the latter . The film , adapted from the novel by Jeanne Duprau , tells the story of a small city named Ember that , over two hundred years prior , was locked away by the city 's founding builders . The city is run solely on the power of its massive generator that lies beneath like a beating heart . However , the old generator is slowly falling apart , casting the city into short periods of darkness . Doon Harrow -LRB- Harry Treadway -RRB- , a young boy recently assigned to work on the pipes of the city , is convinced that only he can fix the generator and help the city . During his explorations of the piping systems , he finds a mysterious room that is unmarked on his maps . With the help of Lina Mayfleet -LRB- Saoirse Ronan -RRB- , the two teens discover the secrets of Ember and the answers that may help save the townspeople from eternal darkness . When ` City of Ember ' was released into theaters , it seemed to have gone by the attention of most people without much notice . With a production budget of over $ 50 million , the film only raked in about $ 8 million domestically . But , why was this film such a tremendous bomb ? From the looks of it , it had little to do with the film 's quality . It has a very solid cast behind it , the story is entertaining , kids movies at this level typically do well , and the trailers made it look to be very beautiful -LRB- which it was -RRB- . It would seem , then , that the film was simply just undermarketed . Very little attention was given by the marketing team for this one and that 's what killed it . Had ` City of Ember ' been given a proper marketing campaign , it could 've been very successful . The film is really quite good . The acting , as expected , is fantastic . The cast of legends like Bill Murray Martin Landau were fantastically chosen ; and , the ` Lovely Bones ' star Saoirse Ronan is quickly becoming one of the best actors of her age group , not to mention a definite for a few Oscars in her lifetime . The story is very entertaining , even if it is n't the most original or mysterious . The set design , however , is really what sets the film apart . Ember is built into a fantastic and beautiful city , from the underground and above . One issue that many seem to have deals with the CGI effects in the film , especially some of the scenes towards the end . While some of the CGI is spotty , it 's hardly distracting enough to remove from the overall beauty of the film and no one should allow such small issues to detract wholly from an overall good film . While book purists appear not to love the film for the oversimplification of the adaptation , those who have not read Duprau 's novel should have a good time with it . Final Verdict : 8\/10 . - AP3 - " ,8
" A charming fantasy tale . I saw this movie 2 days ago in a very rainy day . I wanted to escape worries of the day-to-day life , and I gave this movie a shot without really knowing what I should expected from it . And what a surprise ! This movie was a great adventure fantasy movie with a good plot , a coherent universe and sweet characters . Probably the movie was targeted principally for kids but as an adult I never got bored a minute . I think that nowadays we do not have enough of these movies that main purpose is to create a viable alternative universe and allow you travel fro a few hours far away from your place . And this one does , so do n't hesitate if you tired of watching City of Lost children for the 25th time , or you know all the dialogues of Dark City by heart , a must ! " ,9
" Stuck between a fairytale and a SF . It could have been better . Tim Robbins and Bill Murray in a kid oriented movie about the last city on Earth . It could have been grand ! Philosophical and funny , witted and dark . But no , they were in the film just to attract audience in roles not worth mentioning . Also , the movie got stuck between two genres and therefore was destined not to satisfy neither audience . Logic holes in the script so blatant that it limited the viewers to the age of 8 , but had social irony which could have never been understood by said kids . It was happy happy joy joy like a fairy tale , but it showed the complete obedience of a populace in the face of corrupt officials . It had a steam-punk appearance and a fine satire to the religious cultists , but a ridiculous premise . Too bad , so much potential and so little achievement . Better luck next time . This one is merely average . " ,7
" Very good book adaptation . with a few plot changes , but that 's understandable , I mean , they ca n't go exactly from the book , word for word , because there are some things in books that just can ' be put on screen . I do n't get why people do n't like this movie so much , I mean , THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME !!!!! The whole idea of a City of Ember is very believable . You can tell they used every cent of their 55 million dollar budget , because , jeez , the sets are fantastically real , the costumes look authentic ! The part of the boats actually being the lockers was genius . I never saw it coming . It was a little easier I bet for the filmmakers to film a moving turnstile than a cave against the rushing water . ;-RRB- Love this title , go see it while it is on DVD , because -LRB- sadly -RRB- it did not do well at all in the box office , so probably no adaptation of `` People of Sparks '' :-LRB- " ,9
" Discover The Secret . For generations , the people of the City of Ember have languished in a world of artificial lights . But Ember 's once powerful generator is failing and the great lamps that illuminate the city are starting to flicker . Now , two teenagers in a race against time , must search Ember for clues that will unlock the ancient mystery of the city 's existence , and help the citizens escape before the lights go out forever . One of the most entertaining adaptations from a book that I 've ever seen , even a different league from Harry Potter himself , `` City of Ember '' is one of the best films I 've ever seen . It 's painfully short and saying that is a paradox of a compliment and a flaw . The first book in the series of four books is obviously a set up and the movie acts like this too , which is unfortunate . If you could n't already tell , this film did n't make a lot of money in the box office . Basically , it bombed . What does that mean ? The possibility of the next three movies is very slim and that means you and I are going to have to read the books to find out what will happen . Like I said , it 's just a shame . The film is fantastic with an incredible amount of imagination , a fantastic production design , and a grim look . It would 've been great to see all four films get made . Getting that out of the way , I loved the fact the film was darker than most family films . It 's dark , yes , but not very dark like `` Prince Caspian '' or `` Harry Potter 3 '' but it 's dark enough to have teens and adults be drawn and spellbound by the movie . It 's very enjoyable and the movie ends like that because of the fast pace . I honestly wanted the movie to be an hour longer because everything went by so fast . Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan is here still giving her best . Her performance is very well done and just authentic . She 's one of the better young actress out there and shines this bright light at us that we fall in love with her the first second we laid eyes on her . Harry Treadaway does well as her friend , although nothing very special . Tim Robbins and Bill Murray seemed wasted here because they do n't appear in the movie that much . The movie is very entertaining with a great use of imagination , fantastic special effects and production design , and a very intriguing plot that would captivate any willing viewer to watch the movie . Like I said earlier , it 's just sad when you see such a good movie go to waste when people do n't watch it and forget about it . Let 's just hope they will make another movie . " ,7
" Wonderful film , made me want to read the books ! . I had never even hear of City of Ember , but when my mother asked my husband and I to go see it I decided to go . I was not expecting this at all ! City of Ember was a wonderful movie ! I can see how people who have read the books are giving this bad reviews . With any movie that comes from a book there will have to be some changes , even if just for the fact of editing for time . After seeing City of Ember I could n't wait to get to the store to buy the books ! I 'm glad that this movie had this effect on me and will probably inspire others to do the same . Instead of criticizing how the movie does n't follow the book as much as you believe it should , you should just enjoy the film for what it is and then you can re-read with new visuals to think of !

" more to a bottle cap . Fox you fools !!! you have a real gem of a movie here and you are wasting it there may be ` more to a bottle cap than keeping liquid escaping ' however there is also more than selling a movie than the odd random TV spot ! This may be a film that succeeds in capturing the magic of the family film glory days of the 80 's , -LRB- it took me right back to when I was ten years old and for the first time in years allowed me to become totally engrossed in the world that was portrayed before me -RRB- this does not mean you have to stay true to the 80 's in your marketing campaign !!! Merchandise?Billboards?Internet?Giveaways?Video games ? . . . . No - just a lame trailer ! Its 2008 get with it FOX ! This movie will no doubt become one of those titles that the next generation discovers by chance who will pour upon it the real attention it deserves strangely much like the box in the movie how ironic ! 9 out 10 " ,10
" Engineering and mechanics save mankind not electronics and software ... . I really enjoyed this film it had a fairly interesting and original idea that of a disaster befalling mankind and the only escape was to construct a sort of generational enclosed underground city -LRB- similar to the idea of a generational spaceship traveling from a polluted earth to find a new earth -RRB- but then the purpose is forgotten over time . In this case the power is running out and there 's a corrupt Mayor -LRB- played by Bill Murray -RRB- with his evil sidekick played by the splendid Toby Jones . Over time the instructions for exiting the city are lost and forgotten . Martin Landau also makes a cameo appearance . The production design of the retro underground city and its associated -LRB- very analog -RRB- technology is believable and excellent . There is a strong emphasis on engineering and mechanics rather than computers and software which when you want something to last 200 years makes sense with a small enclosed population which needs to self - sustain itself with limited resources and which is in a back-to basics de-evolving state . Very good but as with ` When Worlds Collide ' -LRB- 1951 -RRB- , ` Logan 's Run ' -LRB- 1976 -RRB- and ` THX 1138 ' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- I would have liked to have seen more of the ` new world ' and the way in which our protagonists adapt -LRB- or fail to adapt -RRB- to it . There 's a nice -LRB- predictable -RRB- sunrise scene at the end of the film which I was fully expecting . " ,8
" Watchable . I also once watched this in Science class , since it has to do with the types of energies and stuff . This is one of the best PG movies yet . The storyline centers around Doon and Lina , two kids who want to get to the bottom of the mystery of why the electricity keeps blacking out for a few seconds every time . The acting was not top notch . The Mayor was the worst actor . Sometimes the girl who played Lina was a bad actress . It could scare some kids when the gigantic mole runs around and when its mouth tentacle things touch Lina 's hand when she is grabbing the box . Mild violence . This is a Science fiction , action , adventure with a twinge of comedy . Suitable for children , just the mole thing could be scary . 9 - " ,7
" Wonderful and Creative ! . Enjoied this film very much ! Most films are all the same Ideas , But this one really stood out with amazing and brand new ideas ! Wish they would make a second one . Tralier looked fantastic so we bought the DVD , Watched it many times and still enjoy it ! Cliff hanging Drama ! If you need a good film this is defiantly a good one ! Super film and great for all ages ! This film is about a girl -LRB- messenger -RRB- and a boy -LRB- pipeworks . -RRB- When the human race built a city under ground , and called it City of Ember . They made enough resources to last 200 years , But its been 200 years now and resources are running low . Then when two children meet they set out on an adventure to escape into the world above , bringing along the girls little sister called Poppy They have to work out a lot of puzzles and risk their lives in great adventures to escape , but will they do it ? I would highly recommend this film to all ages ! " ,9
" Originality is Over-rated . Some reviewers seem to think this movie was not sufficiently faithful the book . Personally , I could care less . -LRB- And I 'll happily say the same about film versions of books that are near and dear to my heart . -RRB- You want the book , go ahead and read the book . THIS City of Ember happens to be a movie . A really entertaining movie , that works amazingly well on its own terms . -LRB- And made me want to read the book , which you 'd have to agree is a good thing . -RRB- Other reviewers seem to think this movie ripped off the game Fallout , or the movie Dark City . Well , I 'm afraid you are WAY out of touch with culture . This movie ` rips off ' endless previous works . The first one I thought of was Arthur C Clarke 's haunting novel Against the Fall of Night . Then I thought of the game Bioshock . Then Robert Heinlein 's novel Orphans of the Sky . Then George Lucas ' film THX-1138 . Then a rather under-appreciated book by British SF writer James White , The Watch Below . And THEN I thought of Dark City ... None of those parallels bothered me at all . Why should they ? I ca n't recall anyone disliking Bioshock as a rip off of Against the Fall of Night . The theme of people trying to escape from a ` lost ' city is classic , well worth revisiting periodically . And this movie does it really well , bringing a number of unique strengths . I very much liked the two kids that are the heroes of this story . I liked all the small characters , especially Martin Landau as the over-the-hill maintenance man . I LOVED Bill Murray as the villainous mayor . He should play bad guys more often . And above all , I really enjoyed the visualization of a 200-year-old city where all the technology has been failing for generations . No , the story held no surprises . So what ? Tell me you did n't know from the start how Die Hard was going to come out . Or Raiders of the Lost Ark. . Or The Guns of Navarone . Or , in fact , ANY ` genre ' movie . When the destination is known , it 's the journey that 's important . And I really enjoyed every minute of this journey , from start to finish . City of Ember -LRB- the movie -RRB- is well-written , well-acted and visually beautiful . It 's got a rousing story , quite a few laughs and a really great -LRB- if well-worn -RRB- premise . That 's more than enough for me . " ,8
" Enjoyable . I have not read this book , but I read a lot , and something I 've found to expect is : Books are 9 times out of 10 better than the film adaptations . My thoughts on the movie Fabulous work paid to the environments , sets , ambiance , all in all , the entire community and style of ember was very enthralling and interesting indeed . But unfortunately I think the movie suffered from the same things with a lot of movie\/book adaptations . As the film continued , too many things are introduced , too many story elements , characters and events are cramming together , and it just starts to feel like they are rushing things to get everything that made a good story in a book into a hour and a half movie . I find I am left far too curious about too many things that they did n't have time to properly explain or explore . -LRB- big bugs ?? wha ? -RRB- I am most defiantly picking up the book for a more detailed story of ember , but as it stands now the movie is an enjoyable one . It 's just so hard to trump books . " ,7
" Great Fantasy Adventure ! . I really liked City of Ember . I was reluctant to see this at first because of some negative reviews and poor box office totals . But , I decided to buy this DVD and I am glad I did . Mankind is near the end and a group of humans decided to move underground . After 200 years , the generator of the underground city broke and it 's up to two teens to find an escape route back to the real world . The acting is excellent . The two fine actors Saoirse Ronan and Harry Treadaway were great . Tim Robbins did good and Bill Murray is great as the arrogant , lazy , corrupt mayor . This movie has more special-effects than I thought it would have . They were not too shabby . I liked the newly-evolved moles that are 100 times bigger than normal . I liked the score , set design , nearly everything . But , this movie started off slow and that is why I rate this movie 9\/10 . " ,9
" Yet another religious-based movie . I was quite excited when I picked up the DVD , thinking that this movie might be a true ` adventure ' movie . Alas , the whole story line is nothing more than bible story and a propaganda for ` intelligent design ' in disguise -LRB- e.g. god is transformed into ` the builder ' -RRB- , how one has to follow the word of the bible to the letter -LRB- e.g. follow the ` instructions ' of the builder literally -RRB- , the boat to save the people , how the builder had planned everything , and so on . The story line lacks any ingenuity , originality , or suspense . And the fact that such strong reference to bible was not even mentioned in the description of the movie at the back of the DVD is really disingenuous and rather cunning . I think it was an utter disappointment , and a complete waste of my money in my opinion . " ,1
" Not all bad . I 'm one of the people who does n't compare the book to it 's movie . So I 'm not going to do that for City of Ember . However , it is very hard not to , when the plot of the movie is fragile and could fall apart if the string was pulled a little . A -RRB- The beginning was a dead giveaway . What is that about ? Have n't you people heard of something called ` twist in the tale ' , even if it a lame one ! B -RRB- The entire plot , loosely held . No supporting ground , just plain confusion . C -RRB- This book is not that long . It could totally pull off a one and half hour movie if it were done right . I guess its too late to think about that so lets think about the good stuff . A -RRB- I guess the two stars were decent . Treadaway and Ronan have talent for sure . But is n't Doon supposed to be a 12 year old boy ? Having a 24 year old play a 12 year old is really pushing it . B -RRB- The visual effects and settings were good . I guess that held the thrill of the movie . C -RRB- Somehow the ending was pretty nice . It pretty much follows the book , unlike the scenes before it , but it has this mellow feeling to it that was not captured quite well in the book -LRB- no offense to the book fans -RRB- Overall , the movie is NOT ALL BAD . It is good , but has terrible flaws . I hope the sequel , if they ever make one , manages to outdraw its predecessor . " ,8
" a lesson in Karma for movie makers . It is pretty bad when watching the trailer is enough to know you NEVER want to see the movie . I read the book , as did my 8 year old daughter . She saw the movie at school , after they had all read the book . The point of seeing the movie was to show the kids how awful it was - and none of them liked it . These are 8 year old - and they got the fact that the book was lost in the movie - that all the bells and whistles and special effects were no replacement for an actual story . I was pleased to read that they lost money in making this film - good to see Karma can , and will get you when you are greedy and without substance . Tom Hanks should be ashamed of himself . " ,1
" the book is SO much better . i read this book for summer reading and there 's so many changes that it 's just simply horrible . like why does Doon look so much older than 12 yrs old and why did Luna 's granny die earlier than she was supposed to be and why were the instructions in a circle and why is the box the instruction were in an ugly , simple , plain box ?? the author described it as a nice box . also the mayor did n't get eaten by a monster that was n't in the book in the first place . and some of the cast i thought were n't the best choice , like Doon , Mrs Murdo ... ... and they took things out from the book . and they added things that did n't needed to be in the movie . " ,2
" Not a piece for everyone . I like the idea that writer brought about in this story . There is all lies amongst the big world . Like suggested in THE VILLAGE -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , they always meant there was dangers outside . It was in fact they were not ready to give themselves a try . They only believed in old values that taught by the older ones . Yes , we could learn from them but time changes everything . If we remain the same all the time , the danger was much clearer . Like THE ISLAND , every plan looked perfect at the very beginning but soon it becomes chaotic because there will be defeats over them . We would try denying that because it is an utopia in our eyes . We turned blind to the naked truth . The truth were told and forgotten . It is not a surprise if we did not talk about that anymore . We are not a machine that kept things clear . The adventurous element is the first thing to be considered when the buffs choose that film . I like the art direction of this film because it really remind us that the world is no more a wonderful place if we remain the way we lived nowadays . It is a good lesson for all of us that we did not know the way to live greener . If we keep on our lifestyle , we all live in shaggy shelter in no time . I love the idea inspired in the story and worth trying at least once . " ,7
" Bad screenplay , Great props sets , Enjoyable movie . . I am very excited about this movie . It suffers from some of the things so common in fantasy films : Simplified storyline , too many things fall into place for the characters , generally directed at children when it does n't need to be to include them . That being said , unlike most of the Fantasies in the past few years , these traits do not ruin the movie . The star actors do a great job , the story premise is interesting and relevant to today 's world , and above all THE SETS AND COSTUMES ARE F-ING AMAZING ! Finally a director has come who is over the whole CG dazzle and understands that CG has it 's place but that it should be reserved for things that you could n't otherwise do . Yes , this movie includes CG , but wherever it can it steers away from it . Interview with Gil Kenan on cinematical.com Kenan says `` I 'm not really impressed by special effects . I feel like I grew up in a generation where -- I knew how a blue screen worked when I was a five-year-old , and growing up with magazines like Cinefex around , there 's no illusion to it . It 's much more interesting to me to tell a story in a primitive way . That gives me the excitement that another generation of filmmakers has had of pushing the technological envelope -- I feel like it 's a backlash to that stuff . And I feel like it 's important to balance . There 's a lot of fancy digital effects in the film , but they were used when the effect could only be created digitally , when there was no way to do something practical . '' This is a crucial attitude in the advancement of quality fantasy and sci-fi films . For years now we 've been plagued with things like `` episode '' 1-3 of Star Wars , or worse , the CG animated re-edit special edition of the original Star Wars trilogy . UGH ! Anyway , City of Ember brings back great costuming and set design aesthetic and is a huge step int he right direction for the future of fantasy and sci-fi film . And of course , it 's engaging , enjoyable , and cool . Even if a little too childish \/ badly written to go down in history as one of the greats . Being his second film since the short animation that got Gil Kenan his career , and being such a step up from that , I am hugely excited to see what this fledgling director will be coming out with next .

" Good movie in its own right , but book was still better . The book `` The City of Ember '' is an excellent book , and an excellent book series by Jeanne Duprau . The very fact I found out about the books is the movie trailer . After reading the books I was excited to see the movie even realizing from the trailer that many things would be changed . That be said after watching the movie I enjoyed it despite the many changes in technology -LRB- aka phones existing in Ember -RRB- , Lina parent 's deaths -LRB- drowning trying to escape , rather than coughing disease -RRB- , and giant animals . I did enjoy having Doon 's father increased in the plot , but did n't like how it took Mrs. Murdo 's character down . I do n't think the characters had as much depth as they did on screen , but that can be expected when character much of the time consist of thoughts and feelings . And the escape being more complicated than the book was OK , but the book had action and plot on a different scale . The sets were beautiful and I think Martin Laing who did an excellent job on Titanic equally did an excellent job on Ember . That being said I would recommend the books to anyone who remotely enjoyed the film . Egress from the Theater and find the books and turn on a light before the blackouts begin . Sit down on your couch -LRB- you may need to move the yarn -RRB- and enjoy the books by Jeanne Duprau . A brilliant author of an amazing book series . " ,7
" Burns quite brightly . City of Ember is a movie I fear that is destined not to do very well . When I saw it today there was a grand total of five people in my screen , three of which were me and my friends . Neither of my friends had ever heard of the movie , none of my family had a clue what it was about , and the only person that appeared to know anything about it had said the trailer looked a pile of garbage . So I was n't expecting all that much from the movie , however City of Ember is not by any means a bad movie . In fact it verges on being a very good one , but the ending kicks the audience in the teeth and then makes it just a slightly above average one . The movie works very well for the majority of the film , the cast is extremely strong and the movie is by no means ever dull . Unfortunately the plot is the problem , while it is intriguing , an underground city that reaches the end of its life , unfortunately the writer does n't seem to go very far with it . The sense of menace is never really there , while the sudden blackouts add a bit of oomph to the movie , apart from that , and a very big mole -LRB- do n't ask -RRB- there never seems a sense of urgency to escaping . Still this is bound to entertain kids , and for once the kid actors do n't grate at all , in fact its some of the adult members that I found much more annoying . Anyway its Half Term fodder , and while it is n't Potter or Narnia standards this will entertain kids . So onto the cast . Well the headlining star from all the publicity I have seen , would have to be Bill Murray , despite the fact he is n't in it all that much . Murray actually is n't all that bad here , if I 'm honest I expected him to phone in another performance much like he did for Garfield . Instead he does seem to be having a bit of fun , and his character is interesting and develops more towards the end . Still there is n't an awful lot to say about him as he has roughly twenty minutes screen time in total . The main kids are played by Harry Treadway and Saoirise Ronan -LRB- from Atonement -RRB- , both of whom are very good . Treadway is particularly good , while his character is basically the usual stereotype , a boy who feels he is more than what he really is , who wants to make a difference , goes on a grand adventure . He has fantasy lead written all over it , all he needed was to be a farm boy and we might as well have called him Skywalker . Anyway Treadway makes him a very interesting and layered character . He also has considerable chemistry with Ronan , who delivers an equally as impressive performance . Her American accent is pitch perfect , and while she is n't as good as she was in Atonement , she still gets the job done . Tim Robbins shows up in a relatively pointless role as Doon 's father . Martin Landau is great as Doon 's mentor in the pipeworks , and in my opinion deserves the most praise in the movie . Finally Mackenzie Cook also is pretty damned brilliant , once again putting on an American accent that sounds very legitimate . City of Ember might have a strong cast , but as I have said the storyline is at times questionable . The start of the movie is perfectly fine , we 're given a lot of back-story about how Ember came to be , and how a box was passed down from generation of mayor to the next -LRB- very well filmed scene -RRB- . The storyline in fact works perfectly fine until after the kids decide to do something . Once they get their hands on the box and go on their quest not an awful lot seems to happen . In fact the instructions they receive are so damned simple it makes you wonder whether that part really deserves as much screen time as it does ? Also everything seems a tad to convenient , one scene towards the end made me roll my eyes in annoyance because I could not believe nobody had turned a certain wheel for over 200 years . The ending as well is god awful . I accept happy endings , I have no problem with them , but the ending here made me want to vomit . Anyway this is nitpicking , mostly the storyline is engrossing , even though the inclusion of the mole is really questionable . The action is n't half bad , although the CGI for a bit in a boat is pretty poor . But the set designs are the real star , not since Del Toro have I seen sets to beautiful . Overall City of Ember is a movie that I did really enjoy , and would happily watch again . But the storyline must be taken with a pinch of salt , and be prepared for an ending that most people will just be a bit dumbstruck by . " ,7
" The Cast were Great - Everything Else ... Not So Great . I just do n't understand why . The book was a masterpiece which could have been made into a good exciting movie series if they had a better group of people working on it . The cast not included , they did the best they could with what they had , which sadly was not enough . This film just had little effort put into it and is not even close to relatable with the book , it uses very little from the book its based on . The only thing that it uses from the book is the title , characters , and main plot ideas , but everything else including the little details , characters , and lines are missing . This movie gave me nothing to like besides the cast and acting but thats about it . I did n't like the visual effects , diologue , excitement , faithfulness to the book , the character development , the script and well thats about it . I did n't like the visual effects because they were B-Movie cheap and thats sad the mole did n't look real , the animals and boat flying down the water did n't look real , it was all cheap to cheap for a film that cost what it cost . I mean little effort was put into the visuals , it is truly sad . The diologue in this movie really sucks its all so cheesy , B-Movie style . Who wrote the script for this movie i mean who did it i want to slap him silly so hard that his check bleeds i swear i am so angry with the diologue . The excitement is very little , i know that the idea of this movie seems really exciting , well it is in the book anyway the movie does little to excit the audience at all and that left me saying not worth my money to see unless on t.v for free i swear thats what i felt when i rented it , this film is just soooooooooo bad and boring . The worst part of this movie was that this film was not faithful to the book in any way , shape , or form . There was so little that this film included from the book besides the obvious i swear this film could have had a solid 2 hours running time , and maybe i would give it a 4 star review , thats all it needed is a little more from the book , maybe another half an hour or so , to make this film good , but it did n't include that so it sucked . The characters are really flat i swear . Meaning the director spent little time on character development i am just so upset by how little we know about doon 's father , and Lena i mean those characters needed more character development so we could better understand their feelings . Lena i know has feelings for Doon somewhat which she barely hints at in this film which was sad , and her character development with her grandmother was also sad . And as for Doon 's father well we barely even see him , we learn nothing about his past , like his mother , Lena 's father , its sad we do n't learn much about his past it would have been interesting . The script was rushed including little from the book and a lot of stuff that just does not make sense . Like how they knew all the words on the map so quick and were able to find out all the clues so fast its really weird and stupid . Oh and we ca n't forget the worst director in the world everyone meet Gil Kenan , possibly the worst director in the history of directors . He poorly directed this film , making everyone clueless ugg , i mean he sucks they should have had Peter Jackson come and direct this film , he could had made this film somewhat good . Now onto the one good thing with this film ... The cast and acting . The cast is Brilliant !!! Including Saoirse Ronan -LRB- who is possibly one of the best and upcoming actors -RRB- Bill Murray , Toby Jones , and MacKenzie Crook . The cast was great . Unlike the other people on the set the actors actually wanted to make a good film they really did , they acted perfectly the way their characters would have and should have i loved them , they deserve all the credits at the end heck make Harry Treadaway the new director , am i right ? The cast is great love them . All an All this film sucks featuring workers who basically do n't care weather or not the film is good they only wanted to get paid cash and move on to their next projects unlike the great cast . This film 's lights turn off sadly . D - " ,3
" Utter Crap . Yeah That Summarises What I Have To Say . The Plot If any is -LRB- now please do n't hate me for revealing it -RRB- At the end of mankind on Earth , the scientists build a self-sufficient underground city for a few people in order to preserve the human race for two hundred years . They leave also instructions for the future generations to return to the surface of the planet in a steel box that should be kept by the mayors through the generations . However , the instructions are lost and the inhabitants stay in the city that is completely deteriorated . The power generator has problems and the blackouts are longer and more frequent and the city is running out of food that needs to be rationed . On the Assignment Day , the teenagers Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow are assigned to work with the pipework and as messenger , but they swap their job positions . Lina , who is the descendant of the seventh mayor , finds the box of instructions in the house of her grandmother and shows it to her friend Doon . They decide to explore the way out of the city and they discover that the corrupt major and his henchmen are stealing food from the population . When they are hunted by the major 's hoodlums , they have to find the way out of Ember to survive and save the populations from the imminent darkness and the end of the city . Now a city built underground would n't last for 200 years . what kind of government tells kids to pick jobs out of a hat ? a #### ing horrible one if you ask me . To all people who like The Shawshank Redemption and people thinking that Tim Robbins actually saved his career with Shawshank Redemption -LRB- even though I 've never seen the film -RRB- : Tim Robbins #### ed up his career with this movie The Only Reason I Gave It A 2 Is Because Unlike Most Book Movies It Did n't Spawn 8 Sequels -LRB- I 'm Talking To You Harry Potter -RRB- " ,2
" all style and design , no substance . This film seemed promising out of the gate with some nice design and mood setting , but falls apart quickly with extremely sloppy plotting . It does n't make much sense to begin with , and the non sequiturs really start to pile up after the half way mark . I was particularly baffled by a lengthy tangent into a tunnel that led to ... a decision to switch to another set right away . Such jarring , illogical transitions leave the viewer feeling jilted . Why pay attention if the storyteller is just going to throw away the last ten minutes ? By the third act , the film is almost incomprehensible , and there 's nothing left to do except watch the not-so special effects ... which are n't even worth watching anymore . Although the design is interesting earlier in the film , it falters along with the plot : the amusement park ride in a boat down long chutes and high waterfalls , which mysteriously leads upwards to the surface of the Earth , not only defies logic , but is also fake-looking , digitally processed to death . And there 's no reward for sitting through all of this . The triumphant emergence onto the surface is so rushed and cheezeball that I did n't even get a flicker of feel-good . This film manages to make 90 minutes feel like twice as much . Other than some intriguing design work and a nice set up in the first 20 minutes , it has nothing to offer . What a waste of movie-making resources . Blyeah . Did n't read the book . Guess I should . " ,3
" Worst kids\/young adult adaptation since Series of Unfortunate Events . The Series of Unfortunate Events series was one of the best book series I 've ever read . Amazingly , Hollywood managed to crap it up by changing important , and entertaining , details of the plot , not to mention , cramming three books into one movie . This adaptation of City of Ember is even more of a disgrace . The entire ending is nothing like the book . The book was n't about fancy machinery that was supposed save everyone from the city . The story was about Lina and Doon figuring out the secret and staying away from the mayor . This horrible movie did n't even look like the city . The book even has a map of the city in it , and Hollywood could n't make it look like the book . Unbelievable . I read tons of books . City of Ember could have been amazing . Just like Series of Unfortunate Events , CIty of Ember could have been Peter Jackson\/Robert Rodriguez good . Come on ! I 've been a Jim Carrey and Bill Murray fan since i was five , but doing these movies makes me sick . They 're both horrible . CIty of Ember : terrible adaptation . It makes me vomit . " ,1
" Murdered a potentially good story . This movie had a lot of potential , but blew it all away , frame by intolerable frame . The rather intriguing story line was run over by poor script writing - the intriguing soon became the absurd . I went to watch this movie because Bill Muray was in it and I have yet to see a disappointing movie with Murray in it . Well , as they say , there 's always a first time . The cast did an average job , given the burden of shoddy story telling they had to carry . On the whole unless you are going through a particularly masochistic phase of life , please avoid this movie . " ,4
" A disappointment - read the book it is MUCH better !!! . I was so looking forward to this movie since I have read the series of books by Jeanne DuPrau . This is a book that I have read to more than one class of students -LRB- who have loved the book ! -RRB- . I was extremely disappointed in the movie and by the numerous changes from book to screen . About the only thing that the screen writer got right is that it was about Lina and Doon . The addition of technology -LRB- that did NOT exist in the book -RRB- did give me a chuckle - was an R2D2 robot necessary ? Why did they have telephones - with telephones they had no use for a MESSENGER at all !! This movie could have been so much more - unfortunately the screen writer decided to rewrite the book ... and RUINED it ! I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has read the books - you will be DISAPPOINTED !!! " ,3
" Hmmmm ... Nice movie , but ... . OK , I like it . Admittedly , I did not read the book -LRB- did n't even know about it , but I will look for the audiobook after this -RRB- . Like those who have read the book , it is easy to see that the mole in the film is completely useless and unnecessary ; whatever exec thought it needed something like that must have been thinking of how to keep his kids in check . So was the pseudo-immolation of Sul , but then , like he said , he was doing his job . Ye , there are some holes , but , really , it is pretty good ! I enjoyed it . I like that the future portrayal is not a squeaky clean city that many envisage . it is also nice , unlike any sci-fi -LRB- can I call it that -RRB- film I have seen , that the guardians of Ember are friends the people discover , not come to a world that they have to enter in fear , but in a quest of knowledge , to see how the world changed . One thing that really blew me away is how these people would first perceive a sunrise . How can we imagine what it would be like to come out of the horizon when what you expected was total darkness ? To go through that feeling must be insane ! Unlike the characters , I know I would be in total shock and wonder . Well , I do that at every sunrise\/set I see that is amazing , anyway . And the music . Really not bad . Grand , but not melodramatic , not puffing out it 's chest . Hopeful , yet grounded . Very interesting . Goes with the style that this sci-fi flick relates much more to home than just a total fantasy with no relevance to our current society . About Saoirse , she looked terrific in the red messenger jacket . I like the twined stitching -LRB- I used to fix my clothes that way but her 's is better -RRB- . And she looked so clean in this role , more than in any role I have seen her in . To be honest , she plays characters I do not like much , but there is no denying she did a great job of this one . How she says she likes to go fast is cool . :-RRB- Interesting that this film bombed , not that I even knew it existed until a few days ago . Many film goers may want more fantasy , not extensions of our reality . Love the design of the buildings . Could not help wonder how the Builders could envisage that their technology would last 2 + centuries , and that the people would not be innovative with technology to improve what they have . An easy film to realize how extremely important it is to keep knowledge . Anyway , it 's a fun flick without being stupid . Amen for that ! " ,7
" Missed opportunity . I went into this movie without knowing anything about it or about the book . It started of good in my opinion , a city under the ground because above ground humans made a mess of it all ... And that 's about all I liked about this movie , you never get to hear why exactly they went underground which is a shame and why they have to stay there so long . Plus the story started real slow and never quite seemed to pick up speed , it was like watching a high speed chase involving snails and turtles . The actors were good but the story the characters had just were n't that interesting and I never had any feelings with them . It was like all the actors in the movie had an equel role in the movie and that role was not to stand out to much . . All in all a shame because I really liked the setting . " ,3
" To use a term the kids are throwing around these days ... epic fail . . Bill Murray and Tim Robbins together in a sci-fi adventure . Could I have asked for more ? Before I saw it , I might have said no , that will do nicely thank you very much . Does it need a great script ? No , of course not ... it 's the simplest most clich d sci-fi story in existence : A group of survivors isolated from the rest of the world embark on adventure to reach the outside world . Logans Run for kids . Ca n't go wrong ... But what I had n't anticipated was how every scene would be magically devoid of any energy , momentum , or interest . Even the `` set pieces '' - and it 's an incredible stretch to call them that - were so bland it was like eating boiled vegetables . Nor had I anticipated some of the biggest continuity flaws and plot holes I have ever seen in a movie . Here 's one example -LRB- SPOILER ALERT -RRB- ... to get out of the city , the kids take a roller coaster boat ride down multiple ramps , down chutes , down waterfalls ... down down down ... then miraculously emerge 1 mile directly ABOVE the city . So directly above it , in fact , that they can drop a rock straight down into the streets below . `` Huh ? '' you say ? Yes , that 's what I said too . And trust me , this is just one of countless such logical boo-boos throughout the movie . I could probably forgive it if common-sense had been abandoned in order to cram in some exciting action scenes ; but in a movie this mind-numbingly dull , plot holes were just extra nails in the coffin . " ,3
" Based on a book , City of Ember . DUMBEST show ever !! Even though the book was way better than the show , the movies did n't clearly introduced us to the characters and does not leave a strong impact on us unlike the book did which really set us thinking of how badly the world has damaged . The only phrase here was FOR THE FATE OF ALL MANKIND ! Besides that , this show sucks to the very core of the old and new world ! The acting was okay i guess , come on they are really good actors\/actresses but the whole bloody storyline made them look stupid ! As if they ai n't got any balls of their own to time to appear serious or afraid or even shocked ! I waited more than 3 months to watch this movie after reading the book and it left me disappointed ! The book was damn nice and this movie ruins my entire good impression of CITY OF EMBER ! " ,1
" good core , bad coating . i love parts of this movie . apparently , from the other comments , they are the parts that come from the book . i also really love the actors , they did a remarkable job . i loved some of the feel , of the jobs people had , the social commentary bit , and i really loved the costumes . the problems ? someone wanted to make dark city or some other CGI nonsense . a lot of the ` stunts ' make absolutely no physical sense . i felt like i was watching someone play an inane puzzle video game sometimes , instead of dealing with human emotion and relationships . i also was really tired of the special effects and visual style ... they were just too ` manufactured ' and unnatural . the water wheel is a perfect example . they try to use some physical conundrum to make it so that a puzzle must be solved and a man must sacrifice his safety to help others . instead , we get this ridiculous sequence full of ` awesome ' computer effects which wind up looking fake and horrible . instead of having one , well framed , slow , well thought out shot of a scene , with reaction shots from the actors faces ... the filmmakers often instead choose to jump cut every 0.75 seconds , pile cgi crap on top of cgi crap , and feed us a giant , empty sandwich without meaning or emotional impact . still , it is not a bad movie . it is just , kind of , sad and ironic ... these movies that protest ` the system ' , the mechanization and\/or control of the human spirit -LRB- like the film Vexille -RRB- , are often perpetuating that very problem , relegating the human spirit of their actors and characters to be mere props in the wet dream of some computer jockey who studied HR Giger and Dark City and subscribes to Juxtapoz . " ,10
" Plagiarism . This movie is example of bad plagiarism . Shurely , it is based on some literal piece , but unfortunately which is also based on computer games classics . Not to be subjective , this is classics i 'm talking about , not some brand new popular shooter whose fame people like Uwe Bohl like to exploit and make a crappy movie . I 'd like to think that it 's meant for people who does n't know about these games , but again it 's a mere shadow comparing to them . It could have been easily titled Bioshock ; underwater ... ups , sorry underGROUND city , utopia that went wrong , retro-future scenography like we 've already seen in Gilliam 's Brazil . Or it could have been titled Fallout ; nuclear holocaust , experts build sanctuaries , 200 hundred years life support -LRB- the same amount of years , total blasphemy !!! -RRB- , and most of all a small cubic briefcase with instructions in it mented for the generations who will build the world once again -LRB- did someone said G.E.C.K. -LRB- Garden of Eden Creation Kit -RRB- . And for a big finale , the movie has the same story as first hour of Fallout 3 - we 're born in the vault , we live in the vault , we die in the vault ; same quasi-religious relationship , just the vault is replaced with generator . Bad acting , boring storyline , lame music . As for me , if I was CEO of Bethesda I would sue them ! " ,3
" Kids try and get out of Ember . First off I 'd like to comment on the stupid little girl that does n't do anything the whole movie except for annoy me . Poppie , that 's right ... . Poppie . A stupid name for a stupid little girl . It was n't good enough that the rest of the movie was garbage they had to go and add that talentless little moron to put the cherry on the cake . Second I 'd like to comment some more on that stupid little girl . Poppie . Why is she even in the movie ? I do n't see the point . I hate poppie . It 's time to give up the cheap special effects . They look cheap because they are cheap . What ever happened to miniatures and puppets , have we all forgotten great classic movies like labyrinth , neverending story and willow . This movie insults even a 2 year old . " ,1
" ruined a good book . Giant moles , moths and beetles ? Give away the ending at the beginning , and ignore the excellent character development of the book ? They even dumbed-down the puzzle of the message from the builders . That 's an excellent way to trash a great story . I expected much better from Walden Media , who did such a superb job with `` The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , '' and Playtone -LRB- you just dropped a notch in my esteem , Mr. Hanks -RRB- . Caroline Thompson should be ashamed of herself . Why would she do so much to change a good story ? My daughter , who loved the book so much she read it aloud to us , has warned all of her friends to avoid the movie . Hope they lose their shirts on it . The only positive note is that the acting was very good , the set design excellent . Too bad the story ruined the whole thing . " ,2
" Very disappointing . Why do these movies feel they need to include a bratty , spoiled , overbearing kid ?? The ridiculous performance of Jaden Smith added annoyance to the empty script . The movie starts off well enough , and then tries miserably to develop the characters and make us care for them . The Bates role is absurd ; Cleese 's role has virtually nothing to say this amazing encounter . The military point of view is typical ; as if there 's only one area where the military is useful -LRB- I would expect nothing less from `` Hollywood '' -RRB- . There were some very interesting ideas -LRB- the sphere-like ship , the nanobots , the Gort acronym -RRB- and the effects were top notch , however Gort -LRB- the one thing the movie had going for it -RRB- was on screen for less then 10 minutes . Keanu was perfectly cast and Connelly does a good job with what 's given to her . All in all , another flop of a remake . This actually makes the War of the Worlds remake shine . I saw this movie in IMAX - if you 're going to see it , find an IMAX theater . Lastly , am I the only sick of seeing the same old New York back drop ? I love New York City , but come on ! Be original ! " ,4
" I could n't sit still , let alone stand . . I do n't know about the earth standing still but I certainly had a hard time moving after this one finished . I think I may have been in shock . I did n't know they still made movies as bad as this . That 's me , I guess ; the eternal optimist , thinking one day Hollywood will see the error of their ways . I 'm starting to think there 's a greater chance of aliens landing in Manhattan though . You do n't take a highly regarded classic like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and update it for no reason other than to make a few bucks . Sure , you can pretend there is purpose ; you can cash in on the current environmental crisis fears by insinuating that aliens have come to earth to save the planet from the horrifically unappreciative human race . When you make a film with such disregard for quality though , you ca n't do anything to convince me that you actually care about what you 're trying to say . I will give Hollywood this though ; they have finally found the perfect vehicle for the now - veteran Hollywood actor , Keanu Reeves . Reeves plays Klaatu , an alien in human form who has no capacity of expressing human emotion or understanding the intricacies of human nature and interaction . It might as well say that at the top of Reeves 's resume so this is Reeves in his element . Honestly though , this is the first time I can say that Reeves 's presence in a film has absolutely nothing to do with why it is unwatchable . You know you have a problem when dialogue is so bad that it even drags Reeves 's acting down . In fact , having the familiar Reeves on board for this uneventful journey , alongside the strikingly beautiful , Jennifer Connelly , at least gives us something pretty to distract us from the banality of the entire affair . Klaatu certainly rocks that three-piece suit though . The earth is supposed to stand still on this particular day because aliens have descended upon Central Park in a giant weather sphere of sorts . It is a momentous occasion , one that could be the sign of the end of days . Yet , in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL , panic hardly seems to be in the air . Panic comes from a fear of the unknown and an inability to see a solution to your problems but David Scarpa 's script is so painstakingly obvious and formulaic that you can see right through to the end at all times . I hope I 'm not giving anything away here but as if this film would finish with humanity 's extinction . And when the devices used to create the melodrama are so laughably contrived -LRB- who knew that a white step mom and a black step son could have such hard times getting along ? -RRB- , at least you have the special effects to revel in . Mind you , when the special effects are even more ridiculous than the ensuing melodrama in a big sci-fi pic like this , what is there to keep you sitting still , let along standing ? You 'll never believe this but humanity , or at least the American government run portion of humanity , take immediate military action against the alien invaders before giving them the chance to make their case . This next bit is even more shocking . Apparently , violence is not the answer to solving our problems . I swear , I learned so many hard life lessons watching this movie . Perhaps the most important lesson though is that humanity will never learn . THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL represents the same disposable and commercial interests that are the root of our environmental problems . Yet , here is it preaching against the very values that justify its existence . For that reason alone , I would consider this film to be one of the most hopeless -LRB- and hapless -RRB- films of the year . We 're essentially doomed so I say you can take it , Klaatu . Earth is all yours . We clearly do n't deserve it . " ,4
" What Happened to Gort ? . The Day the Earth Stood Still is an utterly pointless movie remake . The original - and I 'll pause here for everyone who 's never seen it to roll their eyes - is one of the best sci-fi films of all times . This modern telling keeps only the names of the characters and abandons everything else . In this version the trouble starts early on . Alien visitors arrive on earth -LRB- in an improbably crowded Central Park at night -RRB- but we do n't see the landing of their vessel . Instead we get lots of dramatic mist and scientist types in haz-mat gear looking lost . Keanu\/Klaatu emerges from a pretty orb , greets the pretty microbiologist , then gets shot . Cue Gort , the indestructible robot guardian of peace . In what should have been the most dramatic part of the film ends up being its biggest disappointment . Gort , a textbook example of budget CGI filmaking , appears and makes a loud noise that frightens police dogs . And just when he seems poised to open a can of whip-ass , he gets silenced by Keanu\/Klaatu who is coiled up in a fetal position on the pretty microbiologist 's lap . The rest of the movie plays like a throwaway Spielberg vehicle with a cute kid , lots of cheap sentiment , an alien who eventually goes home and the never-ending message that Love Will Save The Day . Listen folks , save your money and seek out the 1951 version , filmed in beautiful black white . The soundtrack alone is worth the price of a rental and when you see it , you can join the legions of fans who 's eyes glaze over when they hear those three immortal words : klaatu barada nicto .

" The Day The Earth Stood Stupid . Ouch ! $ 11 times 2 wasted on IMAX . There are so many plot holes in this film I do n't know where to begin . 1 . A UFO is rushing towards NYC . Prediction is a cataclysmic collision . They assemble a team of scientists and rush them right to ground zero . Are you kidding ? Never happen . 2 , The UFO `` lands '' and the first people out are the scientists . Even ahead of the military . One walks right up to shake hands with the alien . Please ! Never happen . 3 . Klaatu is brought for interrogation . They bring him into a room with a lone interrogator and leave . Are you kidding ? No guards in the room ? Never happen . 4 . The military decides to enclose GORT in giant steel panels . They built these in a matter of hours ? How ? Where ? 5 . After enclosing him , he is lowered into some underground laboratory that appears custom-made for him . Where did that come from ? How did they get him there ? 6 . They break a diamond drill on GORT and say it will take 24 hours to fix . The boss barks `` Fix it now '' ! . They send in a poor schlub who promptly screws on a new drill bit . Then the sucker dies . 7 . Klaatu meets with another of his kind who has lived among us for 70 years and apparently become quite fond of us . Why did n't he convince the rest of the aliens not to destroy humanity ? He came to the same conclusion that Klaatu eventually reaches . 8 . The `` swarm '' is destroying everything man-made in its path . We see it destroy Giants Stadium in a matter of seconds . Then it is in Central Park . Why are n't all the buildings in Manhattan falling down ? Klaatu has n't done anything to stop them up to this point . Oh -- I could go on and on . Then there are all of the plot clich s ; Good scientist resists evil government . Frustrated step-mom \/ disconnected stepson find redemption through love of dead father\/husband . Boo hoo hoo . Stupid general fires all his big guns at indestructible alien . You know what 's going to happen . Yup , general gets destroyed\/vaporized\/eaten . Oh , fugitive scientist , alien , and kid go to see kindly old professor . They always do that . And the authorities always show up there . This movie stinks on ice . I 'm not a huge fan of the original but at least that had a story and decent acting . " ,1
" The Day the Audience Shrugged Their Shoulders . `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' is a stunningly inept remake of the 1950 's classic of the same name . It 's one of those big-budget films so unfathomably dull and inane , you wonder how it ever got made . Whereas the original warned of the dangers of nuclear armament , this modern update boldly chides us for being mean to each other and not taking care of the environment . Gee , Hollywood , thanks for the swell insight ! This Christmas season Hollywood teaches us that people can sometimes suck , but only that special kind of film can suck totally . Although the entire production is horrible from top to bottom , the inert direction of Scott Derrickson and the randomly asinine script from David Scarpa bear most of the blame . The screenplay clearly went through arbitrary rewrites , perhaps after being focus-grouped to death , and shows not a single breath of imagination . Around every turn , it wastes opportunities and insults the intelligence of the audience and gives us not one authentic character or moment to connect to . Even when it thinks it 's being cool -LRB- like the lame reveal that those alien spheres are actually `` arks '' trying to save animal life before the world is annihilated -RRB- the script fails miserably . One sphere that is shown on the back of a pick-up truck being attacked by flame-throwers in some foreign desert town inexplicably contains squid , because , well , the shadows of squid inside a giant sphere look kinda neat , that 's why ! At least the script teaches us one thing . Apparently all you need to do in order to survive an apocalyptic robotic alien insect attack that devours everything in sight is to hide under a bridge in Central Park ! The saddest part of the film is how the director wastes his talented cast . The always wooden Keanu Reeves was perfectly chosen to play the alien Klaatu , but even he seems to be disbelieving the words that are coming out of his mouth . Poor Jennifer Connelly , an immensely emotive and alluring actress , appears to be in physical pain or constipated for most the film , obviously stunned she agreed to star in this junk . Kathy Bates and John Cleese apparently showed up only for their paychecks and sleepwalk through their lines , and at one pivotal moment where Bates ' Secretary of State attempts to show regret for some bad decisions made , she actually appears to fall asleep in her chair . And then there 's poor little Jaden Smith , who appears bored to tears throughout the film and is given no direction from Derrickson except when he is asked to cry on cue in the supposed emotional climax of the picture that left me feeling sorry for all involved . However , if anyone should be hung for this travesty , it 's the producers , who must 've run out of money at some point and filled the gap in funds with some nauseating product placement . How else do we explain Klaatu 's trip to McDonald 's for an important meeting with another of his kind ? `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' is easily the worst film of the year . At least `` The Happening '' had its accidentally humorous moments . This clunker offers no such relief . Even the special effects are done in a lazy and unimaginative manner . It 's so awful , I was stunned into stillness while the rest of the audience seemed to shrug their shoulders . " ,1
" Sponsored by McDonald 's , Citizen , Honda and LG . A schizophrenic film . Scott Derrickson has done his best to make a run of the mill CGI-enhanced sci-fi thriller but has found himself thwarted by the remarkable screen presence of Keanu Reeves and the ghost of Bernard Herrmann . Reeves was the draw for me ; where some find him laughable , I find him sober and engaging . His alien-in-a-human is at once non-porous of emotion but registers the emotional to-ing and fro-ing that decide his actions . He 's a classy screen idol , well-cast . The rest of the cast -LRB- the very capable Jennifer Connelly included -RRB- are at the mercy of a truly ridiculous story both in concept and in local narrative . The gravity of the situation in which humankind as represented by Americans finds itself is only captured in the single-gear performance of Reeves and the unobtrusive but peculiar ` Herrmann ' score , resurrected for the film by Tyler Bates . There 's a lot of silliness - a lot of cartoonish world 's end drama which , strangely , does n't do what it purports to which is update the 1951 original . It still feels dated . We are also presented with John Cleese as a Nobel Prize winner . Well that 's also ridiculous on the face of it - but I tell you something , if the end where nigh and you wanted someone leftfield to plead your seemingly intractable case , you 'd do a lot worse than Cleese . As a final oddity the product placement in the film seems at odds with the frowning upon consumerism that 's at it 's heart . Or maybe they 're companies leading the charge to save the world . It 's all a bit confusing . 4\/10 " ,4
" Not in the same Universe as the original . Probably the biggest letdown of my sci-fi viewing life . Even worse than the 3rd `` Alien '' movie . So many bad points that I ca n't remember them all . I 'll touch on the lowlights . First , as the unidentified object approached earth , everyone seemed dumb on the reason for the change in direction . Duh uh , like would n't a spacecraft immediately come to mind as a possibility ?? Then the excitement and anticipation of a visible ship was taken away by clouds and fog and a vague vessel . As stated elsewhere , the initial contact in the park was ended with Klatu getting shot for an offered handshake -LRB- no mysterious equipment popping open -RRB- . And several times in the movie , there were vehicles , equipment and\/or people more evenly spaced out -LRB- in large areas -RRB- than a marching band . Rather than go over a scene by scene critique , the following complaints come to mind . 1 -RRB- bad writing ; all actors had trite and often repetitive lines . 2 -RRB- The Secretary of State was scary , illogical , and did n't seem to be in much contact with the bosses -LRB- the President and VP -RRB- . 3 -RRB- Poor or no acting by the `` Stars '' and the kid . 4 -RRB- choppy flow , frequently too slow or unclear . Weak continuity , scenes seemed to be just stuck together . 5 -RRB- Gort was pathetic . Like the recent `` Hulks '' , unconvincing CG and too big to realistically show it in contact with humans . -LRB- should have gotten Shaq for the part -RRB- ... 6 -RRB- No actor to actor chemistry ever formed . 7 -RRB- The final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the `` standing still '' time and the alien departure . What message did he leave us with ? Since I 'm a poor typist and ca n't immediately recall all of my issues with the film , I 'll end my comments by saying that I have no problem with changing a remake so that it is more up to date and offers some different twists to add interest . However , this film completely missed the mark of maintaining the strengths that the original script had , namely convincing acting with consistent story and character build-up leading to a dramatic final scene with a clear message to all of the world . They could and should have done far far better . " ,4
" The Kid 's Not Alright . Can one little kid ruin a movie ? Yup . Think I 'm exaggerating ? Watch this film . You can see Exhibit A of it right here in this science-fiction classic film , a re-make of the 1950s hit movie of the same title . This re-make actually would have only bad without inserting this annoying kid , but he made it horrendous . Jaden Smith as Jacob Benson is a spoiled , chip-on-his-shoulder , disrespectful kid who incessantly talks back to his mother , who puts up with it - which is equally annoying for most audiences . What was the purpose of inserting this kid in the film ? What were the writers thinking ? I 'm glad to see a number of reviewers here agree with me on this one . I guess if you 're the son of a famous actor -LRB- Will Smith -RRB- , they 'll insert you in film roles , even if there is no purpose to it . And Hollywood wonders why people do n't go to the movies much any more , and they sneer at pitiful re-makes ? Meanwhile , Keanu Reeves was a good choice for his starring role : an emotionless robot-like alien . Reeves is such a wooden-sounding actor to begin with that playing a bland robot is good casting for him . Klaatu is tailor-made for him . Comedy was provided via the ludicrous environmental fear-mongering message in here . I laughed out loud in several spots when Klaatu explained to us the reason for his mission . It 's so stupid , it 's laughable . I was reminded of Ed Wood 's horrible sci-fi stories in the 1950s . I will say some of the special-effects and the surround sound in here is excellent . It was the highlight of the movie . These are good visuals and good audio , and a nice film to view on Blu-Ray . Unfortunately , the story got in the way . " ,3
" Keanu as Klaatu and other comical touches . Laughter makes the almost two hours not a total loss . But I do n't think , somehow , that `` The Day The Earth Stood Still '' was meant as a comedy . They must have realize however , that having John Cleese as the scientist was bound to provoke some giggles . Keanu Reeves is priceless as the wooden , expressionless alien . A great , unintentional , comic creation . Kathy Bates , in pantsuits if you please , plays the American Secretary of Defense and the whole thing does n't have a single ingredient of the elements that made the Robert Wise original one of the classics of its genre . The visual tricks are good but repetitive and rather confusing . I must admit I was n't bored I was just puzzled . " ,4
" You know what 's sad ? 1951 had better special effects than we do ! . So I was one of those people who was screaming no at The Day The Earth Stood Still remake , the original is one of my favorite movies . It 's a terrific sci-fi film , probably the best to come out of the 50 's era . I highly recommend it ; moving onto the , sigh , remake . Keanu Reeves , mmmm , what on Earth about him scream alien ? I guess since it looks like it hurts when his face expresses human emotion , he 's what the director needed . But what I did n't appreciate about the remake is that it completely changed the story and the moral the first movie brought to us . If we were to have a remake of this story , at least it seems like in today 's world it moral is more important than ever , that humans are just destroying themselves with all the technology and violence that we have created . Instead , I get 2 hours of Jennifer Connelly complaining to a stubborn Keanu Reeves on how much humans rock . Dr. Helen Benson , a Princeton professor , and other scientists are hastily assembled by the government in order to formulate a survival plan when it is feared that a large unknown object is due to impact Manhattan in approximately 78 minutes . Nothing can be done about it because a vital military satellite has been disabled . It hits Earth and out of the sphere comes a being named Klaatu emerges from the sphere while accompanied by a large robot . Klaatu , a representative of a group of alien races , has come to assess whether humanity can reverse the environmental damage it has inflicted on planet Earth . In the frightened confusion , Klaatu is shot , but survives and is taken to a government facility . While recovering from his injuries , Klaatu is detained by Regina Jackson , the United States Secretary of Defense , and is barred from speaking to the United Nations . Klaatu manages to escape , and he soon finds himself eluding the authorities throughout northern New Jersey , specifically Newark and the forested Highlands , with Helen and her stepson Jacob . After speaking with Professor Barnhardt about how his own species went through drastic evolution to survive its sun 's demise , Klaatu is convinced by Helen and Jacob that humans can change their ways and are worth saving The three go toward the sphere in Central Park to stop the machine from destroying the world . So when I really think about this movie , it just makes me sad . I was going to be fair with the rating , but gosh , those special effects ? For 2008 , it seems like we got worse with CGI , the ending effects were just way way way over the top . Keanu Reeves is sadly the only convincing actor in the film ... ? Oh , my God , did I just say that ? Not to mention , did Kathy Bates owe someone a favor ? She 's a terrific actress , why was she in here ? I also love how Jaden Smith , Will Smith 's son , is taking his daddy 's footsteps in alien movies , does Will Smith come from another planet ? Because it seems like that family is obsessed with aliens . I 'm going to do you a favor and recommend watching the original Day the Earth Stood Still , believe me , it 's so much better . 3\/10 " ,3
" Horrid Film . Just saw the film . It was AWFUL ! What a way to ruin a classic film . This version has NOTHING on the original . Plot : -LRB- Global Warming -RRB- WEAK ! Beginning sequence disjointed and confusing ! More holes in this story than swiss cheese ! What did the opening sequence have to do with the story ? Klaatu walks out of the `` Globe '' -LRB- where is the ship ??? -RRB- and just as the good Dr. is about to shake hands with him , he is promptly shot ! He was n't reaching for anything but a handshake the universal sign of ` hello ' . Klaatu is taken to makeshift hospital where we learn that he was walking in a ` placenta ' suit one minute and then the next minute they are marveling about how he was ` just born ' . ??? Later in the film he uses some of this ` placenta ` material to bring back to life a cop he just KILLED . It grossed me out when he stuck his finger in the ` planceta ' and then in the dead cop 's mouth ! Why did he bring the cop back , if he was on a mission to kill the entire human race ? Later we learned that the Globes were all over the planet , and they were the ` ARK ' that was saving stuff to be used after the world was ` cleansed ' . -LRB- They actually used the word CLEANSED in this context -RRB- Acting : Then there is the ACTING , -LRB- If you can call it that -RRB- The acting was DEPLORABLE ! Probably the worse I have seen in any movie in the last 10 years ! Kathy Bates as Sec of Defense SILLY , OVER THE TOP , NOT BELIEVABLE . -LRB- I kept looking for her to break somebody 's ankles -RRB- `` The One '' as Klaatu was just plain PITIFUL and PAINFUL to watch ! He sleep walks thru almost the entire film . -LRB- Oh wait that is what Reeves calls ` acting ' -RRB- Jennifer Connelly was terrible also . She was not believable as a Scientist nor as a mother ! She never connected with Reeves or Jaden Smith on any level ! -LRB- It may not have been her fault , I do n't envy what she had to work with !!! -RRB- Jaden , the Smith kid , What in the world made them think this kid could act ! I looked for the credits to see if they were the producers on this film ! I did n't see their name ! How did this kid get the part ! It did n't help that the part they wrote for him was as a spoiled brat who needed his butt . . -LRB- I wish I would call an adult who is now my mother by her first name . -RRB- I would not even rent the DVD to see this movie , I am sorry I wasted $ 6.00 on it . Save your money , The Day the Earth Stood Still was when I wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my time watching this crappy film ! Thank you `` HollowWood '' for messing up another Classic Film ! `` No soup for you '' ! " ,1
" In the age of the remake , a example of how NOT to do it ! Just AWFUL ! . I 'm a big fan of SciFi and as with many who love the genre , I considered the 1951 version a classic . So , I was quite anxious to see the remake . The obvious change in the primary point of the plot , -LRB- war\/violence to environment\/climate -RRB- seemed workable , and if properly executed , had potential . As it turns out , it was potential unfulfilled . I left the theater thinking that was 2 hours of my life that I 'd never get back . Mediocre acting can sometimes be overcome by a really good story and script but no amount of great acting or special effects , which this film definitely did not contain , can overcome a lousy script . SPOILERS FOLLOW In the original the scenes of the Earth standing still occurred at a point in the story line that made sense in the flow of the story . The point was to demonstrate that the aliens did indeed have the ability to destroy the earth . In this version they choose to plug that event in at the end of the movie leaving viewers wondering why . The change in the plot from advanced races sending a being to evaluate and warn us to changes our ways to one in which the decision to destroy humanity has already been made guts the point of the original story and makes this noting more than another `` B '' aliens come to destroy the Earth movie . Finally , the acting in this bomb leaves much to be desired . Keanu Reeves was emotionless , as usual . Jennifer Connelly was almost as bad . Perhaps the most disappointing was Kathy Bates , who is usually a great actor , although I do not know that anyone could really do all that much with the flotsam of a script they were saddled with . Bottom line is that this film is definitely not worth the cost or time and effort of a trip to the theater . If you must see it , do yourself a favor and wait for it to make it to the movie channels or show up in Red Box . " ,1
" Why Have so many bashed this movie ? It 's GREAT !!! . I went to see this movie The Day The Earth Stood Still -LRB- DTESS -RRB- with the feeling of wanting to compare this one to the original . I had read many of the comments about this movie and wanted to see for myself what the negative buzz was about . I was tremendously surprised at how much I liked this movie . I think a couple of things may have misled viewers because of the coming attractions of this film . It seems like folks were probably expecting the robot GORT to go around destroying cities and being a general baaaadasss character . But what DTSS turned out to be was a really good sci-fi movie . You have to really pay attention to the dialog to get the full jist of this tricky film . For Klaatu never really has any love or care for humanity . Their goal is to wipe mankind off the face of this planet to allow other forms of life to exist as well as future beings from other worlds . And pay close attention to what he says near the end of the film when he decides to stop humankind 's extinction . He said it will cost you something . It 's a tricky line , but if you follow it and watch the end of the film you 'll understand why the Earth stands still . I wo n't piece it together for everyone ... see if you can figure it out . I love this movie for it 's smartness . Many have complained about this being another special effects , mindless mess . It is not . The visuals enhance it ... but you really have to think along with the film and sit back an enjoy . -LRB- Updated June 06 , 2009 -RRB- . The film 's ending where Kathy Bates character looks at her watch and sees that it has stopped . Then scenes are shown of trains , cars , boats stopping - suggests to me that the price humanity had to pay for their world being saved was to have all electrical and mechanical devices shut off permanently . Remember that Klaatu does n't have any real love for the human race but begins to see the possibility of their having compassion . So since it was mankind 's machinery that was effecting the planet , the best way to solve this situation without wiping humnity off the planet would be to neutralize all manmade things . Hence the title The day The Earth Stood Still . I might have it wrong , but that 's my take . " ,10
" A disaster . I am not one who is against remakes in principle , not even remakes of really good films . The Day the Earth Stood Still is , as far as I see it , a prime candidate for remake . It would be easy to update this story to comment on current times . Modern audiences , after all , are very little effected by the Cold War anymore . The makers of this new version do , in fact , attempt to relate their film to modern affairs . The alien visitor , instead of interfering over Earth 's nuclear ambitions , comes to out planet in order to stop us from destroying our environment . That 's a perfectly acceptable updating . Unfortunately , as is the problem with most remakes , The Day the Earth Stood Still '08 has the unmistakable aura of having been made for a quick buck . You remember there 's a classic called this ? Throw us a few bucks , and you wo n't have to sit through it in black and white anymore ! And there 'll be a couple explosions ! It all feels so rushed and sloppily thrown together . Scenes contradict each other , little of the plot makes any sense . The visual effects are wildly uneven . Gort in particular is a computer generated monstrosity that looks like he 's been imported straight from a Nintendo 64 game . Pretty much all of the actors do n't seem to want to be there , and almost all of them give abysmal performances . We expect that from Keanu Reeves , but when Jennifer Connelly , who gives it her all even in junk like Hulk , phones it in , you should realize your project has little merit . The entire film is poorly paced and frequently stilted . It never works . " ,3
" A Real Disaster Movie . The days when Hollywood once turned out such classics as the l951 THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL , are long gone . When we go to the multi-plex today , we 're treated to endless , lousy remakes of Asian horror flicks , endless sequels -LRB- i.e. , Saw , Alien , Terminator , Halloween , etc. -RRB- that squeeze every drop of magic from the original until there 's only a dried up rind . This remake of The Day the Earth Stood STill , is a perfect , sorry example of what passes for movie sci-fi\/fantasy in the year 2008 . While the l951 original still fascinates with its powerful acting , script , production and that fabulous Bernard Hermann 's musical score , this new take features a shockingly inept cast and grade-Z special effects . We 're treated to a zombie-like Keanu Reeves who shows the emotion of an oyster . His face and eyes never change expression . His voice sounds like a dead man . His fellow living corpse is Jennifer Connelly who acts as if she exists in a different universe with no connection to what 's happening around her . Even worse , is the obnoxious , surly black kid , Jaden Smith -LRB- oh , yes , son of the mighty Will Smith -RRB- who is so repulsive you wish the giant robot Gort would zap him off the screen . It 's as if the movie makers are so fanatically politically correct that they gave us a black child who is supposedly adopted by a white woman , Jennifer Connelly . They have no rapport , but then the child is so hostile , one can understand why . One of the key figures in the original was the young boy played by the wonderful child actor , Billy Gray . He was so genuinely sweet and likable that you really loved him . When he shows the alien the memorial graveside of countless dead military men and women , and then visited the Abraham Lincoln memorial , you were profoundly moved . When Jaden Smith does this in the remake , a glycyrine tear dribbles down his cheek ss he glares sullenly at the zombie-like Reaves . Wow , what a really down , hostile scene . There 's no sense of impending disaster and when the day finally comes for the Earth to stand still , a swarm of badly executed CGI bugs destroy Yankee Stadium and then stop . Keanu Reeves has obviously discovered that mankind is n't all evil . That 's because the black kid and his mother have persuaded him that there is still good in the human race . If only , there was some good among movie makers , the type of goodness that would persuade them to give us some original , scary movie magic -- like Alien , The Thing , The Terminator , halloween , etc. " ,1
" Not a masterpiece . But meaningful . Frankly , the film can impress me . I went to the cinema expecting nothing from this movie . I thought this must be just another SpecialFX showcase . I surprised me so much . The film began with a man discovering that glassy sphere in the trailer on the top of an icy mountain . In the next shot it left the man and just started telling us what was happening in the present day . Scientists and military people are summoned for an urgent meeting after a strange object had been detected to crash on the earth . Sounds like a very old-school sci-fi ? The movie , however , contain little action and a lot of talking about this and that , all of which concerned much with human 's basic instincts and behaviors . The opening sequence was n't really thrilling at all . The acting was n't perfect . The scripts sound ridiculous at times . If it 's this flawed , then why did I gave it 7\/10 ? Keanu Reeves gave an interview indicated that Klaatu will become more ` human ' , he was absolutely right . Just this ` human ' is a kind of human portrayed in the film . Yes , i praised the quality of special effect . From the beginning those scenes were real eye-candy . In my opinion , casting Reeves as Klaatu was a right decision . He has successfully portrayed something ` alien ' to us . Did you thought that a boy and many character in the film should be killed ? If you did , then the movie have completely fulfilled its purpose : to teach you what human being really is . I did n't understand this until the movie ended and let me having some time with myself . According to the film , Klaatu learned that human race loves violence . And , without any bias , yes , we are . Seeing men fighting for a ticket in the train station , a higher-rank left his crew died just to be safe , and a representative of US government -LRB- one good performance from Kathy Bates -RRB- acting like she rules the world was , for me , reminded me how cruel people treated each others . It you pay fully attention to the dialogue , you 'll see that there 's more that just a heavily CG-ed sci-fi . " ,7
" Klaatu 's -LRB- Not so -RRB- Excellent Adventure ... . The new version of The Day the Earth Stood Still should be offered as a lesson in everything that is wrong with Hollywood today . Robert Wise 's 1951 version is perfectly fine on its own , and there was no reason to remake it . The movie begins with a scene where a mountain climber in 1928 encounters a sphere , which collects his DNA to produce a clone who looks just like Keanu Reeves eighty years later . The scene is completely unnecessary and is handled better by exposition later in the movie . Flash forward to the present , where Jennifer Connelly is a scientist and a single adoptive mother . -LRB- Keep in mind , the equivalent character in the 1951 version was a simple government worker , and that was just fine . -RRB- The government grabs her to prepare for the impeding arrival of an unknown space object . Well , this is pretty much the setup for the 1951 version , the UFO lands , and its occupant is shot by a nervous soldier . The robot Gort emerges from the spacecraft and mixes it up with military . Except now Gort is 40 feet tall and rendered by CGI . The alien Klaatu is rushed to the hospital , where his request to address the UN is refused by Kathy Bates playing the Evil Government Lady . -LRB- Incidentally , more of liberal Hollywood the US is portrayed as the ` bad guys ' . -RRB- What follows is Klaatu escaping from the Secret Government Facility , and then proceeding to meet with another of his kind who 's been here for seventy years . -LRB- And they meet at a McDonald 's . Is n't Mickey Dee part of the problem ? -RRB- They mutually conclude humanity ca n't be reasoned with . Now , the 1951 version was topical because it was only a few years after WWII , and humans were creating weapons capable of destroying the planet . It was a cautionary tale . This one tries a cautionary tale as well , we mean old humans are slowly destroying the planet , so these advanced aliens are going to destroy it quickly after extracting the snail darters and spotted owls . Yup , the environmental reasoning of people who fly around on private jets They are n't the problem , you are ! Connelly 's character convinces Klaatu to meet with one of our great scientists , played by John Cleese -LRB- Actually , the former Python gives the only decent performance in the film . -RRB- Unfortunately , Cleese asks the sensible question , if you 're so worried , use your advanced technology to fix the problem . Oh , wait , ca n't do that . We 'll just exterminate your whole species and most of the others and then reseed the planet . Yeah , that makes more sense than slightly adjusting the CO2 level in your atmosphere . Well , a bunch of actions scenes later , which should have convinced Klaatu that we are a bunch of homicidal maniacs , he changes his mind and decides to save humanity . Except by this time , Gort has converted into a swarm on flesh and metal eating Nano-bots that proceed to expand over the east coast . The end of the movie is Klaatu calls off the nano-Gorts , but renders all technology on the planet inert . Of course , this makes no sense . That would n't just ` change our lifestyle ' , it would result in 6 billion people dependent on industrial agriculture starving to death , leveling forests to keep warm , probably eating some of those endangered species to stay alive . Missing are the 1951 's version 's Christian allegories . In the classic , Klaatu comes to us with an important message , lives amongst us as Mr. Carpenter -LRB- who else was a Carpenter ? -RRB- is betrayed and killed , but rises from the dead . Before he ascends back in to the Heavens , he gives us an important message that we need to straighten up our act . This one has no such subtlety , it 's just an excuse for CGI and action sequences . Okay , lessons to be learned class . 1 -RRB- If a movie was perfectly good the first time around , it does n't need to be remade . If it was n't , then there 's no need to try again . 2 -RRB- Special Effects are NOT a substitute for plot logic , character development or dialog . Neither are action scenes . 3 -RRB- Keanu Reeves still ca n't act . 4 -RRB- Product Placement by corporations that are part of the problem you are whining about undercut your message . 5 -RRB- No need to beat us over the head with the message . We had to listen to the annoying kid whine about his dead father for most of the film . Wise handled this with subtly . We see a tombstone with the name and Anzio written on it . Got the point across . " ,1
" Are you sure you were watching ?? . I am new on this website . I would like to first address 1 of many points . I watched this movie without seeing the earlier versions . I would like to first point out that in several of the comments i have read a lot of people seemed to miss out on details and asked questions they would know the answer to if they watched . This movie had a great ending . Keanu Reeves left and saved the world . He 's an alien i would have thought it fake if he had said goodbye and all that sob story . Hes an alien incapable of showing expression of anger and so on so forth . The movie touched on the evolution of mankind . I think it has an excellent point it shows a belief that people can change if they want to . The effects were great everyone seems to agree on that . I would like to quote a certain comment i caught a glimpse of but forgot the name of the user , He said , What happen to Gort ? Uh he turned into a massive plague that was about to wipe life off the face of the earth . Maybe we were n't all watching the same movie . Klaatu aka Keanu Reeves character saw a different side to mankind because of how the boy felt about his dad . Do we all love our Dads ? Would we cry too if our Dads died ? I agree with a little bit of what some people stated and yes it could have been jazzed up a bit . But i believe that some alien who is about to kill us all because we are destroying a planet , who saves us from certain death needs some credit . Hes an alien for crying out loud hes not gon na wave and smile at us and walk away . Not only that he is not capable of emotion anyway . The threat was there even if it was unspoken . The world was almost obliterated in the first place . DUH do n't you see ? He did n't have to say anything . Look around you many people are dead signs were ripped away and many buildings demolished because of our recklessness . Its the unspoken quality that really gives the movie a twist . If i flip you off i do n't have to swear at you for you to understand what I 'm saying . Keanu Reeves was an excellent choice for the part . He is very good at not showing any emotion in his character . Jennifer Connolly played a good role . If you believed that the earth was going to be leveled would you not try to plead with the alien who could stop the world from being leveled ? I agree with the comment DMCNEIL2 made about the scientists but there was nothing anyone could do . If it was true that the object was speeding towards earth it would n't matter where they were as they would all be dead anyway . But believe it or not it slowed down and no matter where they were yet again , it would n't matter they were in fact all alive because the speeding object stop speeding . Actually if you think about it Gort became a massive metallic bug that could eat anything , great a new technology to research . " ,10
" A Sobering Story About The Stupidity of the Human Race ! . This is a profound story about human arrogance . Most of the developed world and plenty of the undeveloped world believes when it comes to the environment that Might Makes Right ! End of story ! It 's what capitalism is based on ! Plants and animals and landscapes do n't have legal standing ! In other words , they have no rights ! In the Day the Earth Stood Still , the tables are turned on the human race by an extremely advanced , extraterrestrial aliens and then we have NO RIGHTS ! Now we get to see how it feels when our species is considered to be like a virus needing to be destroyed in order to save all other life on the planet . Based on the poor reviews this film received by most people , I guess the storyline has hit a nerve ! Good ! I want to thank Hollywood for having the courage to make such a deep film in a world so crass and shallow ! It 's a sheer pleasure to watch a movie with a message than the usual dribble that constantly makes it to the big screen !! " ,10
" The day you will waste 2 hours of your life . That would be a better title , this movie seemed to be good , after i watched the first 30 minutes i tough it could get better but i kept waiting and nothing ever happened there was no good action , no good dialog , and just a few good special effects . I wont complain about acting i guess Keanus style -LRB- no expressions at all -RRB- was kinda good for the role , but the script was horrible it was like they would just do a lot of random scenes . There are also a lot of senseless stuff in this movie in every scene , i cant compare this to other movies i mean some movies might be worse than this . But this movie was horrible with a good budget and well-known actress and actors . But the worst thing about this movie is that IT Was n't EVEN ENTERTAINING ! " ,2
" \* spoilers \* It 's no wonder the aliens wan na destroy us ! . I was n't expecting much from this film but I quite like Keanu so thought i 'd given it a go ... . but now I wish I had n't ! It starts of so well , very curious , disaster is imminent , army , scientists , sets the tone well that something big is going to happen . Then Keanu arrives and again , very mysterious and feeling like we 're watching a potentially very interesting Sci-Fi film - but then he goes on the run and it all goes rapidly downhill from there . To be fair to Keanu , he does n't do that bad -LRB- has n't got much to do mind -RRB- but he certainly was n't terrible - kinda spooky and has good presence when on screen . The problem lies with how little actually happens around him . The special effects are seen-it-all-before stuff and as a result means the audience gets bored during these scenes - which is basically the whole last half hour - but they could 've done SO much more with this story . The kid is incredibly annoying - a disruptive little brat who spends the first half of the film being a tough guy and the second half of it crying . And there 's absolutely no point to his character being in the film ! If Keanu 's character would honestly stop the destruction of the world just because of a little boy crying over the loss of a loved one , then the aliens clearly had n't done their research into this planets inhabitants in the first place really - therefore not really justifying the proposed destruction in the first place . Jennifer Connelly 's character could quite easily of just been a single woman and the film would 've had the same effect . I have n't seen the original fully so maybe this was key to the story in the original , but I understand the original to be an absolute classic and watching this as a neutral , it 's seemed like a very weak way to end the film . All this film did was help to confirm that the American government really are as gun-happy and dumb as I originally thought they were and the scariest thought about this film is that if anything like an Alien invasion really did ever happen and they did happen to land in America , all of our lives will be in the hands of a bunch of power-mad controlling idiots who are going to shoot our visitors in the head on first sight and bomb the sh \* te outta them even when the president is told that original attempts to use weapons on them has simply made them MORE powerful , he STILL goes ahead and launches another attack !?? It 's no wonder the aliens wan na destroy us they think the whole world is made up of Americans !!! Ludicrous ! Why do n't Hollywood realize that the only films that should be remade are the ones that were cr \* p first time around ??! Remaking classics is always gon na end in being a complete waste of our time and money . I believe they 're in the process of re-making ` The Thing ' . . god help us all !!! " ,4
" Stop putting a cry baby in awesome movies ! . WARNING : I AM THE MOST EVIL AND HONEST FILM CRITIC IN THE WORLD !! Good : The special effects and acting of Keanu was perfect . Even the message to the world that aliens can come and clean the planet from the parasites called `` Humans '' . BAD : Yes i give this movie a 1 because : It is a Shame they totally destroyed the movie with a pain in the butt crappy acting Child . The performance of Jaden Smith was really terrible . He needs to take some acting lessons . And WHY GOD WHY do they make AWESOME movies with Pain in the butt children ? it destroys the feeling of the movie.Making the hole Movie into a Irritating waste of time and money . And it is even obvious that Will Smith wants to make a star out of his son only because he have money to do it.here is the irony : -LRB- talk about getting a platinum spoon in his butt -RRB- Putting his son in this movie was just cruel to Jaden and this movie and the hole world . My eyes are bleeding . Jaden Smith : `` you can stay in the car , i am going home -LRB- cry -RRB- '' Even if he is in the middle of a forest.absolutely retarded . Jaden Smith : `` Noo you killed him . Buuhuuuuu -LRB- cry -RRB- . '' right there i lost the feeling for this movie . Give him a F slap over the head and tell him to get a grip . cry baby ! And i feel sorry for America when they create movies that makes the American people look narrow minded and stupid . -LRB- Soldier : SHOOT THE ALIEN ! -RRB- yea ... good idea America ? Scott Derrickson and Will Smith needs a slap over the head too , for putting Jaden Smith in this movie . ! " ,1
" A bad remake of a good story . One of the worst remakes I 've ever seen . Sad , because I do like Keanu Reeves . The original story was pretty much followed until Klaatu was shot and whisked away by the army . After that , there was no story . The reason for Klaatu 's visit and the message he was to deliver never came through . We saw very little of a much bigger , scarier and impressive Gort . And the young boy character has changed from a bright , inquisitive kid -LRB- Bobby in the original -RRB- to a mouthy , disrespectful brat . And remember the title ? The earth `` stood still '' for only a few seconds and for no apparent reason to anyone but Klaatu . I do n't mind a little artistic license , but this story was completely destroyed . Everyone who has spent money to see this deserves a refund . " ,1
" Alien comes to earth with muddy results and explanation . . This movie was a complete disappointment . It does not even come close to the original , which was a terrific film , even after over 50 years it is above and beyond the new version . The original had ACTING , was plausible and just contained a real story that made real sense . All the special effects in the new version actually detracts from the story and the real meaning . The robot was reduced to an add-on that appeared the makers of the movie did n't really know what to do with him but felt he had to be in the movie because he was such a big part of the original . I do n't know why Hollywood thinks they can remake a classic better than the original . The same goes with King Kong . The 1939 version is still heads above the two remakes . " ,1
" where did the budget go ? . 80 million budget . On what ? For that sort of money I was at least expecting some spectacular scenes . Nothing ! So we are left with the film , I could say it was a long time since I had seen such a bad , big budget film , but I saw `` the Happening '' , which was abysmal , well this is sub-abysmal , the dialogue is awful , the script is awful , the acting is awful , and I never thought I would say that about Kathy Bates . Keanu needs to be finally consigned to stud . I loved the Matrix , Constantine and Point Break , but lets be realistic , the man is a plank , he ca n't act . Often a film will be good enough to carry a bad actor , well this is n't that film , he 's going down with the boat . Save your money and buy a loved one an extra Xmas gift . Use the few hours of your life you will save on a nobler pursuit . " ,1
" Run , do n't walk , to the exits . I confess that I am a big fan of the 1951 classic . Having said that , I was prepared for and makeover and dazzling special effects . I am also a fan of Keanu Reeves . This remake was a disservice to both . It slogged thru 100 minutes of shaky dialog and inconsistencies . Suspend belief , OK but there is no way to excuse an ending that says `` Hey , we are out of coffee , dialog , storyline and film , ... . roll credits ! '' . The butter on my popcorn went rancid in the presence of this stink bomb . Forget this at the theater , avoid that DVD , pass on the PayPerView , and turn the channel when this fleabitten dog hits the Encore network . Hell , this is n't worth the bandwidth , disk space or keystrokes to pirate it off the internet while you check out the deals on Woot . I want my 20 bucks and 2 hours back . " ,1
" Restful . I went there expecting to be disappointed and was . The annoying child . the nicely constructed but plain old silly imagining of GORT -LRB- he 's apparently a tightly formed nest of space bees -RRB- - which was his name - not an ACRONYM ... yeesh ! I am glad Gort looked basically the same and with proper handling could have been quite a bit more menacing though twice as big as he needed to be . Let me give you a quick review . I went in , loaded down with large popcorn and a 3 quart beverage and found primo seats . Took over the little island of seats -LRB- 3 -RRB- with my jacket and soda and was ready to be amazed . Okay ? So where was the spaceship ? I did n't want a swirly cloud ball I wanted a freaking space ship . Why was n't the kid smart and slick and helpful ? ; why was he a spoiled whiny dangerous asexual brat who changed his mind like diapers ? Well I 'll tell you why . Because in 2008 that is just the type of kids you get.They sure got that right . But the movie really must have gotten really good because I slept through a solid 30 minutes and when I awoke found I had missed nothing both literally and figuratively . I almost drove 50 miles to see this in IMAX and spent 17 bucks . Believe me 9 dollars was enough of a rip-off . I left feeling refreshed and happy because any movie that ca n't keep me awake for the first 20-25 minutes ca n't have much to say . " ,4
" Waste of time , want my money back . Do n't really care about the original . This was just a bad movie . No character development , plot holes big enough to walk all of the illegal immigrants that ever came to the U.S. through and possibly the worst ending of all time . I would recommend waiting until this movie comes out on commercial television like AMC or USA . Maybe the editing for commercial insertion will actually make this movie better . \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* SPOILER !!!!!! \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Come on people ! Taking all of our technical capability is going to make us a happy nature centered civilization ? Only after 96 % of humanity dies from starvation ! This is the kind of thing I would expect from those lunatics at PETA . " ,1
" `` I want my money back '' . One of those movies that I shouldve read the reviews before seeing . We WERE looking forward to seeing this from viewing the trailers . Can anyone tell me where I can write to get my money back . Maybe if we all requested refunds , those in Movieland would think twice about making second-rate remakes . Just because you throw in known actors and better than average special effects does n't make it worth the $ $ $ $ $ . If only I would have waited to read many of the comments from the previous reviewers . If this had not been a remake , I am not sure that I would 've `` gotten it '' And I found the characters to be , for lack of a better word , BLAND . And I am not quite sure what place the Smith kid had in this movie . . Oh , yeah , he is the son of a well-known actor . Thumbs WAY down !!!! " ,2
" The Day The Earth Wish He Cast Someone Else . Keanu Reeves plays a man whose DNA is sampled in 1928 in the Karakoram Mountains in India -LRB- no , its never explained why -RRB- and used in the `` present day '' -LRB- conveniently allowing for the film makers to not let the film feel dated by setting a specific year -RRB- to create a body for Klaatu , an alien who represents a group of other worlds who have come to Earth to stop Humans destroying the planet by eradicating all human life and using spheres as modern day arks to save the animal life . Jennifer Connelly plays Helen Benson a sexy scientist who is called in by the government when they detect an object on collision course with Manhattan that they expected to destroy all life only for it to slow down and land in New Yorks Central Park , she is also the `` wicked '' stepmom to her dead husbands son Jacob -LRB- played by the extremely annoying Jaden Smith who you will end up hoping he dies more than the kids in Jurassic Park . Yes , he 's THAT annoying ! -RRB- . The American Government -LRB- run by the Secretary Of Defense played by Kathy Bates , another handy way for the film makers to avoid dating the film by not naming The President or Vice President -RRB- react as they always do with force and the alien leaving the craft is hurt and taken into custody to be studied . He heals miraculously and Benson intervenes in his questioning which allows him to escape and go on the run . Klaatu 's robot Gort is also captured for study and escapes and commences to remove all traces of life from the planet but Benson and Jacob help him to return to his ship to save the Earth once they show him not all Humans wish to destroy the planet . This entails a visit to a Nobel prize winning Professor -LRB- played by John Cleese , personally I would have removed the whole scene with him in as it is n't explained well enough why they are there or how this helps Klaatu learn more about why Human life is worth saving -RRB- in a very boring and extremely difficult to follow scene which just seems to be there to slow the action down for a short while . Like M. Night Shyamalan 's The Happening earlier this year this is also an extremely preachy film about the environment and how Humans are destroying the planet . It 's not a science fiction film and it 's certainly no attempt to try and either remake or improve the 1951 Micheal Rennie version of this film where they 'd come to stop us all killing each other during the Cold War . If you do n't feel like your watching sections of The Happening and Cloverfield at certain points in the movie then you pay absolutely no attention to movies when you watch them . The film is highly unoriginal -LRB- not just because its a remake , because it blatantly steals ideas from things like The Happening and Cloverfield and it takes far too long to get to the point where Gort starts wiping the Earth out . The visual effects do look very good but as a whole the film has an incredibly cheap feeling about it -LRB- possibly due to the very derivative sections of plot and how long the film takes to actually get anywhere -RRB- and you are left feeling very unsatisfied indeed . The ending is extremely weak and left far too open to interpretation as to what happened and what will happen next . Reeves himself plays the role of Klaatu too much like a cut scene from The Matrix , he 's very stiff and wooden and you feel a waxwork dummy of him would have done a better -LRB- and much cheaper -RRB- job of the role . Jennifer Connelly is n't really enough of a star to be playing the female lead -LRB- most people will only remember her from Labyrinth -RRB- so its pretty pathetic to think Keanu is actually the biggest name in this mainly no-name cast . The director stated Keanu was his 1st and only choice to play Klaatu which reveals several possible things about him - he has n't got much imagination in regards to casting , he does n't know many actors -LRB- painfully obvious from his wafer thin resume on IMDb.com -RRB- or he has no regard for the movie he made so cast the 1st person he could think of . Being forced to watch a movie with a message is fairly annoying at the best of times but when its someone using Hollywood millions to impose their environmental views on the public then its just a waste of effort , time and money that could have been better used if donated to environmental charities instead of ruining a perfectly good science fiction film .

" A decent remake . I walked into this movie with pretty high expectations , even though many comments said ` Stay away ' . I am a huge Keanu Reeves fan and a big fan of the 1951 version of ` The Day The Earth Stood Still ' as well . I thought that this was a good movie . Not great , but good . The visual effects were absolutely stunning , and Keanu playing Klaatu was amazing . The plot , though , seemed a little lost . If an audience had n't seen the original , they would n't exactly know why Klaatu was on earth . It did n't follow the exact storyline , but it was definitely inspired by it . I would 've liked to have seen more of Gort , but overall , it was an awesome movie . I would definitely see it again , if given the chance . " ,10
" The Day The Crap Hit The Theaters . Weapons grade crap ! I 'm forced to give this crapasaurus at least one Star . If you are a fan of the 1951 version of The Day the Earth Stood Still , pass on this one . Other than an alien ship landing on earth and a pseudo-robot named GORT , this movie has nothing else in common with the original and is only a Global Warming Infomercial . Unlike the original , the characters in this remake have no redeeming qualities . Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- : Not a sympathetic character and really has no role in the film other than meandering around . He makes no real attempt to help mankind and like most Global Warming boneheads , thinks mankind has no redeeming values whatsoever and is a scourge on the planet . In the 1951 original , you sensed Klaatu 's -LRB- Michael Rennie -RRB- concern for mankind and , unlike a loving parent trying to teach their children harsh life lessons , had compassion for life and avoided violence and used non-lethal acts to make a point . Helen\/Jacob Benson : The two most unlikable characters of all ! Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- is supposed to be some famed astrobiologist at Princeton University . However , it amazes me that she could put her shoes on . She 's a narcissistic Bad Luck Schleprock -LRB- look it up -RRB- and was the second most wanted character I wanted to see get killed off . This brings us to Jacob -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- . This kid you just want to slap and feed him to Gort . This rebellious eight-year old stepson of Helen Benson is supposed to inspire Klaatu not to wipe out the planet ? If anything , this kid would put our destruction on the fast-track . GORT adds no suspense . Klaatu makes no attempt to strike fear into mankind in regards to GORT . Why he was created ? What can he do ? At least in the 1951 version , Gort was like Damocles Sword hanging over the planet . At least in the original you felt the fear of the characters and the panic of the world ; not knowing what was happening and feeling powerless . Bottom line , If you want a good sci-fi suspense movie , watch The Day the Earth Stood Still-1951 version . " ,1
" The Day The Earth Got Stupid And Went To McDonalds . Put bluntly , to compare this dreadful remake to the glowing , 1951 original would be like comparing a bucket of steaming vomit to , say , a garden of delicate violets , or something to that general effect . -LRB- I think that you get my point -RRB- One of the many , many questions that came to my mind -LRB- while wasting away 2 hours of my life here -RRB- was - Were the filmmakers of this stinkin ' excuse for a remake really so bloody conceited as to believe that they were actually improving on the original ? And , my guess on that question is - Yes . They really were that frickin ' conceited about their precious movie . So , where-oh-where , do I begin to give this rotten piece of Sci-Fi garbage the royal trashing that it so rightly deserves ? Like , how many new levels of sheer stupidity can one movie stoop to before it falls flat on its face ? I 'd say that it usually only takes stooping to one or two levels of stupidity , but , this remake achieved multiple levels of stupidity , falling on its face , over , and over , and over again . -LRB- ho-hum ! -RRB- OK . First I think I 'll take a stab at criticizing this remake 's visual effects . Let 's face it , the whirling sphere effect sucked , big time . Had it been presented in a rainbow of brilliant colors , or something , then , yeah , that would 've been so cool . But as it was , it was a mighty meager and unforgivably dismal replacement for a spaceship . When I added up all of the expensive CG effects together as a whole they were certainly nowhere near to being an acceptable substitute for plot logic , character development , and intelligent dialog . To me , the overall inferiority of these visuals proved , beyond a doubt , that the special effects created for the original , 1951 version were far superior to these in every way imaginable . When it came to this remake 's story -LRB- if you could call it that -RRB- - It totally killed me that this hypocritical , little flick actually preached that well-worn clich which warns us all that Violence is not the answer to solving our problems - And , yet , all that this film was about was excessive violence -LRB- for its own sake ? -RRB- . And - In the name of humanity , military action was taken against the alien visitor even before he was given half a chance to state the purpose of his arrival . I have to say that I really resented this picture 's blatant product placement tactics . But , then again , how fitting it was that an all-important meeting -LRB- of profound significance -RRB- which took place between Klaatu and a fellow alien-being was done over cokes in a crappy , old McDonalds . Yeah . That just about summed up the intellectual relevance of this irrelevant remake in a literal nutshell . And , finally - Allow me to briefly express my opinion about 4 of this film 's principal actors and their subsequent characters . 1st - Jennifer Connelly was neither convincing nor likable as Helen Benson , a scientist and a mother . As an actress Connelly is a completely brain-dead bimbo . 2nd - Kathy Bates was absolutely atrocious as Regina Jackson , the Secretary of Defense . With her shoot-first-ask-questions-later attitude , she was like a bull-dyke truck-driver , literally , bulldozing her way through her part without even the least bit of insight or sensitivity . 3rd - Keanu Reeves was just like a piece of petrified of wood as the alien , Klaatu . Like , does n't this no-talent goof know any other facial expressions besides that of a blank stare ? 4th - Jaden Smith 's character , as Jacob Benson , had one of the biggest hands in ruining this picture for me . This whiny , snot-nosed , despicable , little suck was worse than the Newt character was in Aliens . You can bet that if this rotten , little twerp had n't been Will Smith 's son then he would 've never , ever landed a part in this film . Jaden 's whole presence made my skin just crawl like you would n't believe . If only his character had been annihilated early on in the story . That way I would 've surely rated this lousy remake somewhat higher than I did . " ,1
" I decided one of my first reviews would be on the movie I hate the most . . . I remember several years ago watching this film . I dunno about the Earth , but I had a hard time watching it ! In fact , I do n't really know if I can review the ending , because I fell asleep half way through after watching this disaster . When woken up by another bored friend who was laughing hysterically at how bad this movie was , I found entertainment in a lady beetles journey from the bottom of a soft drink can to the top , which was far more exciting than the movie . I also noticed somebody else 's comment about the 1951 fan-boys not appreciating this film because it is a remake . Well , I do not think that the oldies are annoyed because it is a remake - because coming from someone who has n't seen the original , and never will due to this film which ruined the concept for me forever , I think they just know how poor the effects , storyline and acting are . It 's very rare you ca n't find a single area of a film that shines in a movie that is complete horror - The Godfather 3 had decent music to make up for the awful acting in comparison to the first 2 , for example . But this is one of those few exceptions - if you are thinking of buying this movie , make sure you are buying it for Christmas day in 3 days time , because the only thing this movie is good for is giving away as a gift . That is if you want to lose friends and get a divorce from a soon to be bitter spouse . Do n't say I did n't warn you . In conclusion : This is the worst movie I 've ever seen , and I 'm not joking . To prove this is the worst movie , as someone who does n't do many reviews , I have written a long and well thought out review to warn you of the safety precautions that need to be taken in order to watch this movie aka . Do not watch this movie whilst awake ! I hope I have ensured that many victims are not sucked into watching this dreadful , and if you are forced to sit through a couple of hours of horror like this , I wish you luck because you will really , really need it .

" A '08 remake manages to be more boring than the '51 original . . I wanted to like this movie , but at no point in time did I trick myself into thinking that this would be as good or even nearly as good as the original . At the very least , I thought , people who have never seen the original would get to enjoy the story with some flashy graphics and it will bring attention to a classic sci-fi movie . I was wrong . This movie is just plain boring . Whether you 're a fan of the original or someone new that thought this looked interesting , I ca n't imagine you enjoying this . My first complaint is that the pacing is so very slow . You spend most of the movie listening to monotone conversations or watching Keanu Reeves stare at things intently . The movie only has one tone , and that 's DEAD SERIOUS . There 's no light hearted moments to contrast the graveness of the situation like the original . All the actors give the same grim-dark unwavering performance , which results in you not caring for anyone in the movie or the situation as a whole . At least the CG is entertaining , right ? No , not really . There 's lots of bright lights and bloom effects , but for the most part it 's poorly done and blatantly obvious . However I must admit , I thought the idea of an ever growing swarm of destructive nanobots was interesting , and I enjoyed watching them wreak havoc on everything in their path . The plot was pretty weak and shallow . It 's worth mention that this is based on a 50s sci-fi movie -LRB- an era where most sci-fi movies were Devil Girl from Mars or Attack of the Killer Ant -RRB- and managed to make the plot less believable and ridden with more plot holes . The motives for most of the characters are far fetched at best , and downright silly at worst . All things considered , there 's really no reason to watch this movie . I ca n't think of a single person who would like this better than the original . Even if I completely ignore the fact that it 's a remake , this is still a weak movie on it 's own legs . Unbelievable , unlikable characters and monotone performances are just some of the low points in this otherwise mediocre and boring movie . 4\/10 " ,4
" Be careful what you wish for . When I reviewed the original The Day the Earth Stood Still , I said that someone ought to remake it because as good as the original is , any picture over half a century old is going to have a dated quality to it . The basic story of that first film , however , deserves to be retold in ways that new audiences can better appreciate . But while almost everything about this remake will be more palatable to modern audiences than the black-and-white classic , they forgot to include the basic story that made the original worth being remade . Both films have the same beginning . An space craft lands on Earth and an alien named Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- emerges , only to get shot just a few steps outside his ship . That brings out a giant robot who starts attacking the surrounding authorities until Klaatu orders him to stop . Klaatu is taken into custody and his wound is healed , then he announces that he has a message for the leaders of the world . He is n't able to give that message and escapes from custody , this time with the assistance of Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- , one of the scientists gathered in response to the approaching spacecraft . As the U.S. military and law enforcement tries to find Klaatu and figure out what to do with his giant robot , Helen and her step-son Jacob -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- discover that when Klaatu says he 's here to save the Earth , that 's does n't necessarily mean he 's here to save humanity . The fundamental thing to know about this remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still is that at every point where the original film was smart and bold , this movie is dumb and cowardly . You should n't be confused because this remake deals with certain elements of the story in more realistic detail . That 's just window dressing . If you pay attention , you 'll realize that this film only pretends to have a message and a real point of view . Firstly , this movie does n't specify precisely what the problem is with Mankind . It 's supposed to be some sort of environmental message . Klaatu does talk about how humans are killing the planet but he never says exactly how we 're doing that . Is the problem global warming ? Overpopulation ? The genetic modification of animals and plants ? Resource depletion ? The original film showed the audience what human thinking and behavior it found problematic . The remake just generically classifies humans as bad . I suppose if you already consider other people a blight on the Earth , that lack of specificity wo n't bother you . But by not delineating what human action is so terrible that Man needs to be wiped out , there 's no teeth in 2008 Klaatu 's denunciations of humanity . Because it 's so vague , you ca n't take the condemnation personally , which takes away from any emotional investment you can have in the story . Secondly , this remake never really deals with what sort of changes should be made in the world . Other than a rudimentary Be nicer to Mother Earth attitude , this story never really offers up an alternative to the way things are . The first film very clearly stated If humans stop doing X and start doing Y , we 'll deserve to survive . This film says Humans deserve to survive because well , because a stepmother and a stepson love each other . I 'm not kidding . It justifies the continued existence of Mankind by the fact that human beings care for one another . That sort of namby pamby , undefined rationale has no emotional impact . It 's nice and all that Helen and Jacob are brought together over this crisis but if you 're going to question humanity 's right to exist , you need to come up with something bigger than that personal drama . As far as the acting goes , Keanu Reeves is quite good . Some might say that playing an alien in human form did n't require much acting from him , but he has an ability to put up this wooden front while letting us see little glimmers of what 's going on behind . Jennifer Connelly does n't do anything exceptional with her role , but she does well in showing us Helen 's struggles in relating to her resentful stepson . Jaden Smith has the presence of an actor , but he 's not one of those freakish prodigies like Dakota Fanning or Haley Joel Osment . There 's nothing wrong with his performance but there 's no real depth to it , which you should n't really expect from a normal kid his age . The movie does n't have quite as many special effects as a lot of big budget spectaculars , but it does try and show you something different than the explosion-o-ramas these films normally are . I 'm not impressed by any of it , but I 'm not impressed by modern effects in general . I know computers can now create virtually anything on screen , and I ca n't be awed by anything concocted by a bunch of computer nerds between sessions playing World of Warcraft . Now that these effects are nothing more than lines of code , I ca n't take them seriously . The remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still is n't a bad film . It 's just too dumb and too wishy washy for the subject matter of this story . If you 've never seen the original and do n't plan on seeing it , you might enjoy the remake . But if you ever compare the new version with the classic , I do n't see how you ca n't come away disappointed . " ,4
" The Day the Earth Stood for Stupid Studio Notes . The original film is a masterpiece ! This film is a travesty . Watching this film you can almost hear the Development Weenies trying to find some way to justify their jobs by giving the same tired notes they give on every film . Why is the character of Helen Benson just a ordinary person ? She needs to be a scientist ! She needs to be a powerful woman that has some connection to the alien . WRONG WRONG !!! . In the 1951 classic , Helen is just an average person who winds up in a extraordinary situation . In the original , the most human character is Klatuu . He has more humanity than most of the earth people . That 's what makes that film great . Did they even watch the original ? In this version , the D-weenies felt it necessary that earth people have to show Klatuu the way to feel . WRONG !!! And what happened to You must go to Gort and say these words Klatuu Barata Nikto ? One of the best moments in the story . There is so much wrong with this film it 's pointless to go on . I 'm not going to blame the director or even the writers . I 'm sure they were at the mercy of the DWs . A friend of mine thinks the audience needs to build a giant plunger and start using it on the studios to flush out the stopped drain filled with D-weenies . Maybe a good idea . " ,3
" Bad in almost every possible way . . This movie was bad right from the start . The first scene is a young attractive university professor assigning homework to her students while they 're walking out of the room at the end of class . Even though nobody ever assigns homework like that in real life , for some reason they always do it in bad high school movies -LRB- though usually accompanied by the classic bell-ringing sound -RRB- , so I immediately suspected that this movie was going to be bad . It just goes downhill from there . A convoy of about a million gigantic SUVs shows up at a home to pick up one single unsuspecting person for something so secret they wo n't even tell her why she 's going with them , and for some reason she goes anyway -LRB- unnecessarily sending a million SUVs to pick up one person is apparently a great way to keep a secret -RRB- . She goes to join a group of top scientists or something , and there 's no obvious reason why the military has assembled this group of scientists since they did n't even have any particular matters of scientific interest at that point . Of course this group of scientists contains exactly one improbably young and attractive female , our one-dimensional protagonist . And , being female , she obviously forms an immediate emotional bond with the alien ... After that , it 's basically a bunch more illogical plot and an annoying child , mixed in with a vague pseudo-environmentalist theme of how humans are destroying their planet . The ending was so unremarkable that 10 minutes after the movie was over , my friend turned to me and said wait a minute , did we actually watch the end ? How did it end again ? And I could n't remember either . In retrospect , I probably did n't need to write all that . I can summarize this entire movie in three words : Bad , dumb , and bad . I give it two stars instead of one for some vaguely intriguing moments after they first get the alien into the lab , and the cool giant alien that looks like -LRB- i.e. is a ripoff of -RRB- Iron Man . " ,2
" Just awful . I 'm sure many millions were spent making this , but they really should n't have bothered . The acting was n't bad , with Keanu Reeves playing his role well enough . Similarly the CGI was okay , although nothing to be particularly proud of . Where this film is really let down is in the storyline and the dialogue . Its appalling . This is clear right from the start , where leading scientists are gathered to do what appears to be nothing , except of course discuss the end of the world with limp scientific terminology . However , this is nothing compared to the end , and frankly the less said the better , which ironically seemed to be the director 's view as well . The fact we are supposed to accept that after planning to wipe out human kind for many years , one alien changes his mind after seeing an upset child and step-mum , is absurd ! This film is poor and predictable , and certainly not worth a second look . " ,3
" Expected More . This movie is a victim of its own hype and clever editing on the trailers . There are several reasons why this movie does n't work , although it did have potential . The first reason : The Army is n't retarded . They are portrayed as cro-magnonesque , flying 2 Raptors in to fire on the GORT which ultimately fails , leaving someone whom we are assumed to be in command saying to an airplane hangar full of troops Anybody else got any ideas ? Secondly , the military would be in charge , and there would be much more collusion between department heads then led to believe . Kathy Bates , who gave an average performance -LRB- probably not her fault , her script was bland -RRB- is the Secretary of State , and seemingly the Secretary of Earth , as none of the other world leaders are even involved . Instead of world leaders , we have Jennifer Connelly , an astrobiologist , calling the shots . It is n't really plausible that the US military would allow a civilian to be the first contact for alien visitors . Acting was ... OK . Jayden Smith needs a little work , but again his script was pretty poor , as is the editing with some cutaways with him and Klattu . Keanu was a pleasant surprise , as he looked and acted as stoic and un-feeling as possible , and did it well . Jennifer Connelly held her own , but was n't fantastic . The end of the movie is abrupt and anticlimactic . There seems to be a reason that this was released in the winter , as it did n't have the punch to be a summer action blockbuster . 4\/10 . " ,4
" I do n't think they could have tried any harder to screw-up this movie . . All I can say is ... What were they thinking ? I guess I can understand them changing the premise of why Klatuu came here , but they completely and utterly destroyed my vision of GORT . It seems as if he added GORT into the movie just out of necessity because of the original . As far as I was concerned , GORT was a major character . And what 's with the BUGS ??? I could have done without that as well ! If this was not a remake , I probably would have a better rating for it , but I would have never thought that someone could decimate a movie , that was my childhood favorite to this day , so completely and thoroughly . If you like the original , go ahead and watch this , but , just forget anything about the original . And if you saw the original , see the remake first It may be somewhat enjoyable that way . " ,2
" Devoid of any redeeming entertainment value . Watch the original to see how this plot line should be handled . The original has a decent plot , character development , believable characters , and a thoughtful ending . This remake monstrosity lacks these in abundance . I suppose this was supposed to be some sort of environmentalist argument for all of us to clean up the planet lest we seal our own doom . What happens on screen is basically an alien who shows up one day in a gas-guzzling intergalactic SUV hell bent on killing everybody . So just how much grass and small animals were crushed in Central Park when Reeves lands in his flying Hummer ? Reeves ' character has absolutely no interest in learning anything about humans . The kid is a hyper-active brat in need of a good spanking . Kathy Bates ' character should be nominated for the Redundant Bureaucrat of the Century award . Even Gort manages to be boring . The aliens in this movie are do as we say , not as we do types . Apparently they want earthlings to go back to subsistence living while they tool around space in energy-sucking space ships . If I were around when Klaatu landed , after putting him on strong anti-depressants I would have then enrolled him in acting lessons and a sensitivity training workshop . I am just so angry with myself that I actually sat all the way through this turkey . " ,1
" It should never be made . When I heard that Hollywood was planning a remake for Robert Wise 's reverenced classic The Day The Earth Stood Still I said to myself that I would never watch the remake , ever . The movie was released a few years ago and I was still with the same opinion , but I heard the critics buzz and some of the moviegoers opinions and they predicted a bad movie ahead . But I have the tendency of seeing the disaster with my own eyes and form a opinion about it , because there are times we might be wrong creating false expectations . In this case , it was n't false remarks that I was hearing about . The new version of 1951 's classic , instead of a movie to bring peace and with a powerful message , shows a dark twisted sci-fi film where Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- is here on our planet to destroy us simply because our planet is too valuable for us , people , to destroy it . A scientist -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- will try to do everything in her hands to convince this half men - half creature thing that we can change our destructive habits . And just like the other film , Klaatu might change his plans after meeting a kid -LRB- played by an annoying Jaden Smith , another kid that Hollywood makes us swallow deep -RRB- , and a professor -LRB- John Cleese in his most dramatic role since Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein -RRB- . Why this movie did n't worked ? First , how come you remake a beautiful cult classic and expect to make a hit out of it ? People have a tremendous respect over that film and this could n't succeed at anything except in have better special effects , but the human aspect , the heart of the classic film was n't present here . It has a great beginning , a sort of mysterious thing in the plot but after Connelly got arrested the movie went downhill faster than a car with engine problems in a slippery road . For the most part , it 's boring , tiresome , Reeves acting is in the automatic pilot and by the time the visual effects appear to lift up the audience you 'll be already sleeping , like I did in a few brief moments . It 's good to see Connelly in a nice performance , she never disappoints , Kathy Bates playing a authority figure was very interesting , James Hong 's special appearance was great but the best performance in the whole thing comes from John Cleese . He disappointed a few people with a dramatic role because people were expecting some humor coming from him and there was none , but I enjoyed his brief and important scene . His voice sound very different than the usual comical sound that he 's well known in using , and just seeing doing something different was very nice . There are good actors with some good scenes and that 's the greatest reward you 're gon na get from here . Earth was n't still but I certainly was , almost sleeping while watching this dull film . 4\/10 " ,4
" Pitiful - Just Pitiful . I have never been so let down by a remake of a film I really liked as a kid . First of all , we must realize the original story is not all that fulfilling . It is a difficult concept to present in logic . The alien is not going to make contact with officials , end up in their hands and then escape without some one having taken pictures of it . Once the alien escapes in both makes of this story , no one seems to have thought to have taken a photo of the guy . Also , Gort is underutilized in both films . But , that is the nature of the story . However , in the remake they have destroyed any sense of suspense the audience may have ever hoped for . Keanu Reeves is flat and unemotional . The kid , played by Smith is just so over bearing and snotty you just want to slap him . The Secretary , played by Kathey Bates is some kind of over-powered Wunder Matron with apparently no need to report to the President or the Military ... she is the Uber Commander Klaatu probably wanted to speak to in the first place , considering the power she seems to wield in this film . Klaatus omnipotent powers over all things mechanical make him apparently more powerful a creature than the statuesque Gort . I wanted to see flying saucers , and flashes of heat rays and some better moves on the part of the terrifying Gort . I wanted to see the girl endangered and then blessedly rescued by the scary dude . I wanted to see the scientists and the militarists truly humbled before a greater , benevolent power . Instead , I saw destruction on a mindless scale , with no compassion , and a cast that were well rehearsed , but about as involved in the script as the little nanites that composed the massive , but shamefully inert Gort . I gave this film a 2 only because the digital effects were pretty good , though much over used . Like , the space ship -LRB- s -RRB- were really un-imaginary ... orbs with strange shifting colors ... they could have used a lava lamp . And , worse , the producers\/director seemed devoted to issuing the audience with Al gore hand out leaflets with their green message of Save the planet ... do your part or some disinterested alien will come along and take away our dolphins . It just sucked ! Make a Gorebot Global Warming Fiction disaster movie or make a really cool sci-fi movie . But , leave the proselytizing out of my sci-fi movies . " ,2
" With a Whimper ! . This is a sadly inept movie . It gets my usual comment . Let 's see you had millions of dollars , some wonderful actors , and incredible technology . Do you think you could have found a story to use to make use of it . The two leads are incapable of anything interesting . He is totally confused and hesitant ; she is full of emotions one moment and cold science the next ; heroic one moment and incompetent the next . When the kid is crossing the river , Klatuu should have pushed him in . His character is about as unlikeable as one can be . This film started out well . I was really engaged . But then it got into the same old lack of imagination . If the military is like that portrayed on the screen in these movies , we can kiss out butts goodbye . What if that guy coming out of the ship was just a guy flying a new aircraft . Of course , blow him away now ; do n't ask any questions . I love science fiction and it 's so sad that when given an opportunity to do something with a cool situation , we get this big budget bust . For heaven 's sake , see the original from 1951 . " ,2
" A remake of the 1951 , and not that great even then , sci-fi movie . . What do you get when you take one of the most boring actors around -LRB- not that I do not like some of his work , but KR was perfect for this droll movie as most of his roles are a monotonous character -RRB- and toss in a haphazard remake of a somewhat also droll movie about how humans are destroying the Earth ? You get a good 90-minute nap is what . The Abyss this is not . Have n't we had enough movies about how humans are bad about taking care of our planet and some alien life wants to get rid of us in order to save Earth ? What I find absolutely non-believable in any of these movies is the fact that some very advanced civilization travels millions of light years and we aim some AK47 at the Mother Ship . Which brings to mind a funny scene in the movie , Mars Attacks ! The military shoots off a nuclear missile and the Martians capture the energy and the Martian leader then sucks it up like the gas in a helium balloon . But I digress . This latest remake has to be one of the worst ever , and even stellar actors like Connelly and Bates can not save this sucker . Can we set aside remakes for a while Hollywood ? Though I have yet to see Wolfman . Stay tuned . " ,2
" Ridiculous from start to finish . John Cleese is on screen for what , maybe three or four minutes , and gives easily the best performance . Sure , movies are about suspension of reality , but nothing made this feel plausible . A -LRB- presumably -RRB- experienced mountaineer leaving his tent in a blinding snowstorm without food and water ? Surgeons working on an alien life form without face shields , much less full-body safety ? I just never could get past the utter ridiculousness to get into the film . On top of all that , you do n't come across a single character which would bother you if the world ended and took them with it . " ,1
" Not the day Reeves started to act . This XXI century remake had so much potential to it . For one thing the subject matter has become just so much more urgent with the earth being warmed up by human activities . Plus it actually has a plot that makes a lot of sense and makes alien behavior very logical . Naturally the theme is a little melodramatic , but handled well it could really strike a cord with the viewers ... I guess Keanu Reeves is a perfect choice as Klattu with his wooden acting . Makes him a natural alien and his stiffness , awkwardness actually kinda worked . But still nothing to suggest that this guy can ever return to actually acting . Jennifer Connelly is okay , as the scientist intent on saving the world , but really does not have any film presence whatsoever . The only actor you actually notice on screen is John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt , unfortunately not for the right reasons - it is hard to treat the old bloke as ` the leader of humankind ' and I remember laughing uncontrollably . Really a missed opportunity . The special effects are fine , but they really hid the story in the end . Instead of a meaningful finale we get an action movie ending . Not suitable . Plus too many clich cardboard characters ... You can turn a blind eye on that in the original , but movie expectations have changed since then . If you go retro than you still have to adjust the style a bit ... Overall watchable , but I have n't seen such a forgettable movie since ... aaa ... sorry folks ... forgot the name of it . " ,4
" Very , very , very sad . . I was waiting with great anticipation for this movie . But after seeing it I can say that it was the most disappointing movie that I have ever seen in my entire life . I watch movies for entertainment . If I want to find out about environmental issues I will watch a documentary . This movie was pure , junk-science propaganda and that is all it was . The acting was dismal , the plot line infantile and the overall effects outlandish . In all I considered an insult to my intelligence . Take for example Klaatu 's line about the earth not belonging to man and that if we live the earth dies . The Bible says that MAN has dominion over the earth . I wish that the left would look that word up . In all I consider this movie a bad piece of left-wing environmentalist BS that must have been made by Al Gore . " ,1
" Mediocrity , the Hollywood way . This movie does not event reach the level of a B movie . Why do we need need for so much display of army power . The movie is very noisy and difficult to listen to . The special effects are of very poor quality . The plot sounded promising at the beginning with an alien coming to warn the human race that they will be exterminated if they do not change their attitude of spoiling their planet . But it falls short and then all resulting actions are related to serious inconsistencies . The US army holds an alien against his will and does not tell any other powers like France , Russia , UK , Canada , etc. . What a pity ! The plot reveals a general attitude among US people which is a disgrace : that sense of superiority and lack of respect of the others . I hope that this is not how the soldiers are trained to react to an encounter of the third kind . I hope that soldiers will never have control of such events . Why is it that the ET lands in New York again ? They could have selected Geneva . Among inconsistencies , here are just a few . The contact -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- has incredible powers but can not even communicate with his spaceship . Why did he not fulfil his mission of giving his speech to the United Nation ? Why did the ETs commenced humanity destruction before they get an official response from them ? Why is the US army acting so stupidly by attacking first when the main spaceship does not pose a threat ? The final is horribly stupid since the ETs are going to leave without asking mankind to evolve . This movie is like the ETs in it : no sense of purpose . How low can you go ? This is the feeling I get seeing that movie . Do not waist your time on this one and I suggest you rent the Classic from 1951 . LHR " ,2
" earth got a two hour long commercial for hybrids and cappuccinos . This movie is a shining beacon of product placement . It is a movie that has been specifically scripted to sell products to a distinct demographic . It 's a sci-fi special effects blockbuster that I 'm actually glad I missed in the theaters , the special effects are that unimpressive . GORT is so poorly done that he reminds me of the figurine dinosaurs from the original land of the lost series . Get this , the movie is a script that is a re-write of a script that is a re-write of a movie from the 1950 's . Okay , so you take a sci-fi movie that was a commentary on the violence of World War 2 and the atomic bomb , and rewrite it so that it appeals strictly to hyper liberal upper class wan na be environmentalists and then fill it with product placement that will appeal to this demographic . I.E. hybrid cars and cappuccinos . We 're talking about a movie that uses a hybrid car for its car chase scenes . We 're talking about a movie that has a meeting of aliens in a McDonalds just so they can splash a ten foot tall McCafe across the screen . So in this movie , an alien race comes to earth with the intention of wiping out human life because humans are destroying the earth . Guess who changes the alien 's mind , or at least plays an integral role in doing so ? The retired ivy league professor who lives in a half million -LRB- at least -RRB- dollar lake side house complete with acres of forest property and a beautifully finished real wood full room library . Played by John Cleese . Read the rest of the review at http:\/\/tickleishpickle.blogspot.com " ,3
" Are they really so out of ideas ? . This movie is an absolute insult to the human race and to the -LRB- so far undiscovered -RRB- extraterrestrial race.I mean , what were they thinking when they wrote the script?Keanu Reeves in the role of Klaatu a silent alien , Kathy Bates in the role of the most annoying and stupid defense secretary which just wo n't learn that maybe there is an alternate solution besides blasting rounds into the visitors and Jacob the little boy -LRB- i believe he must be at least 11 years old -RRB- who is thirsty for blood : We should kill them . WHAT?How a little 11 year old can be so blood thirsty that his first line when seeing Klaatu is about killing him , is beyond me . The CGI is pretty good although i 've seen stuff like that in many other movies.One thing that struck me is why would the extraterrestrials destroy us but save the animals?We have the brains , we are communicative , we can express feelings , we can exchange ideas and above all , we can understand things -LRB- science , art etc -RRB- . Sure , i care for the animals as much as anyone does but this is just plain stupid . Final words : a total disappointment , a hilarious role for Keanu Reeves and Kathy Bates has the most annoying role in film history ... it 's like no matter how many alternatives you bring her , she still is full of herself , full of her huge ego We can find another solution , we can talk to him and she 's like NO , we 're Americans and we do it this way.Kill them ! and it 's not that 's she 's stubborn , but she 's just stupid.Give me a break will you !

" A terrible remake . As Hollywood gives more films the green light for the remake , we are treated to a modern day retelling of ` The day the earth stood still ' . With Robert Wises ' original safely in the annals of cinematic greats , one could think this version would , at least be an adequate homage ... unfortunately , not the case . Opening with one of the most unnecessary prologues to a film , the story begins with a mysterious orb arriving on earth , harbouring Klaatu , -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- an alien who is here to wipe-out human civilisation to save the planet . Klaatu is befriended by astrobiologist Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- who , with the help of her step-son and fellow scientist , -LRB- John Cleese -RRB- , attempts to show him that humans have the capacity for change and are worth saving . The role of Klaatu seemed perfect for Reeves , who manages to embrace the emotionless nature of the alien but fails to show any charm or charisma , ultimately delivering a new level of rigidness . While the film makes attempts to capture the tone the original , yet develop its own uniqueness , it gets bogged down with a heavy reliance on special effects , especially towards the end and neglects to develop any good dialogue or meaning . " ,3
" Bad acting , bad flow of the movie , its a low quality moneymaking movie . I had quite high expectations of this movie , and by all means , it starts of very nicely , and pretty fast one is thrown into action . The whole concept is very good but the film lacks about everything . Mainly the actors forgot how to act and the whole situation is not beliavable at all . Especially the situation around the first encounter looks like a B-movie , and it develops like a B-movie . The earths highest command looks really B. The rest of the movie is also like a B-movie . It must have been under real budget . As are some 3d-animations -LRB- lol -RRB- in the movie . I gave it a 2 of 10 and perhaps 1 should be more fair since doing bad SciFi should be more punished . There are so few good SciFi . " ,2
" Had potential but failed significantly . Viewers who have not seen the original movie might like this new film -LRB- not knowing the difference -RRB- but fans of the original will be quite disappointed with this re-make . The modernization and effects are good in the re-make and it explored similar themes that made the original film interesting , but ultimately the re-make failed on two key points : the storyline with Gort was completely changed in the re-make , and the climax of the film -LRB- the Earth standing still part -RRB- was given cursory treatment in the new film , like an afterthought at the end of the movie . This was a huge mistake for the re-make -- botching the climax and central event of the entire film . There were some genuinely touching scenes near the end of the new movie -LRB- featuring mother , child , and Klaatu -RRB- and I was ready to give the new movie the benefit of the doubt if it had kept intact the climax from the original -LRB- and the sober warning that went with it -RRB- as well as the Gort storyline . Instead , the film ended abruptly with these last two elements distinctly missing - hence , my disappointment and the 4\/10 star rating . " ,4
" Complete Mess . I loved Robert Wise 's original film , so this remake was a big disappointment . This is the type of movie that gives Hollywood blockbusters a bad name . The filmmakers have taken a well loved film and produced a travesty . For some reason the idiots behind the film decided that the story could be improved upon , unfortunately their changes make little sense . When a spaceship lands in Central Park , an alien messenger called Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- disembarks . The rest of the universe is worried about the Earth 's environmental record and Klaatu has been sent to tell us to clean up our act . He is shot and captured . Kathy Bates plays a Defense Secretary in the Cheney\/Rumsfeld mold . She decides that the aliens need a demonstration of America 's military prowess and decides to play hardball . The U.S. government wants to keep the alien locked up and his identity a secret . This does not go down well with Klaatu , who concludes that further discussion with the U.S. government is a waste of time and decides to exterminate mankind . Jennifer Connelly plays a Princeton professor and government science expert who befriends Klaatu . In the original film Michael Rennie moved around DC and is gradually won over by Patricia Neal and the other ordinary people he meets . In this film he is shackled to Connelly and her young son . Reeves exhibits none of Rennie 's easy charm and looks dazed and confused most of the time . The child playing Connelly 's son overacts and is an annoying distraction . At the end of the film , Klaatu leaves the Earth telling only Connelly and Professor Barnhardt -LRB- John Cleese -RRB- about his mission , there is no speech to mankind and the film fizzles out . The movie does have impressive special effects and perhaps if they had given the film the benefit of modern film technology and an updated look this remake may have been justified . Unfortunately an American classic has been vandalized , and you have to wonder what they were thinking . " ,3
" Klaatu joins the X Men . When I first saw the 1952 version of the tale , I felt impressed . In the past , I have been successful avoiding updated versions of classic movies , just to save me from disappointments , but this time I felt like falling in . I was prepared to see much more spectacularity in this 2008 version , the regular special effects , and maybe something new in the script . And yes , there was some new things in the script . A rather inconsistent start , The Cold War is still there , plus the global warning , and maybe the toxic assets . There 's also a reference to the altruism enigma . The rest is purely crap . We miss the evangelistic references of the 1952 version . There 's no Jude and there 's no mortality in Klaatu 's enigmatic persona . Instead , he 's a rather flat and expressionless superhero , able to control people 's mind remotely or bring down helicopters with his hands . No thrill . The rest of the cast ranges from stupid to useless characters . The kid is really hard to stand , and the Secretary Defense is unbelievable . Even the heroin looks little smart despite her academic titles , and there 's this pain of watching John Cleese trying to act seriously . But , over all , there you have this gigantic hole in the script . After almost destroying New York -LRB- yes , just recovered from the recent havoc of Watchmen ! -RRB- and lots of stadiums , trucks and the like , Klattu surrenders to rather poor mortal mercy demands , and leaves the planet . Probably then , Klaatu just forgot the movie 's name , and sends a command to freeze the whole Earth machinery pool . But ... Why does he need to demonstrate his strength with a global warning when he just almost destroyed the planet ? Is like sending a newsreel with Los Alamos footage to Hiroshima the 9th of August , 1945 . Purely crap . Nonsense crap . Luckily , we still have the 1952 version . " ,4
" Horrible Movie . The movie stunk bad all along - from the point the scientists are taken to the impact zone to the time when the last sphere leaves the earth . Plainly horrible . Added to that , I felt the moving rushed to the end . The most irritating aspect is the concept of lone women changing the mind of an entire alien race . When you think that is bad , there is a kid tagging along increasing the level of irritation . And then there is an alien and a nobel prize retard exchanging some very quick math . What do people think while conjuring up base less stuff like this one ? Back in 1950s , when people were very new to SCIFI stuff , this would have been a great story . But not these days . I have n't seen the old movie but I think the director plainly copied the story without ensuring it meets the present day standards . Rushing to the end , leaving tons of logical loop holes in the story , very random action scenes - all are quintessential to very early movies . That 's what you get to see in this one . The one and only one thing I liked is Keanu Reeves but am disappointed he accepted this . " ,1
" boring . Bad effects , bad storyline , boring ... i almost fell asleep . do n't go to the cinema wait till its on TV and than go and do something else . Yes i get the idea , it looks like Greenpeace is the main sponsor of this movie . The effects could be better , the storyline could be better . It is a waste of natures resources.I hope that they will not burn this on DVD . what else to say , the movie is slow . . starts slow en ends slow . it is predictable . i would say it is in the same genre as i legend . that was also a bad movie . nae . . seeing it in the cinema is a waist of time.better buy some flowers for your loved one . What else to say over this movie . sorry but 10 lines is way to much . " ,1
" Global Warming - The day the earth stood still . I see so many picked it up already ... the plot ? Are you kidding me ? Alien to human : If you do n't stop killing the earth , we 'll kill you ! Human to alien : Oh NO mister alien ! Do n't do that , look , we 'll change ! Alien to human : OK , but do n't make me come back here ! The end . Straight out of the mind of a global warming alarmist ... Are you serious ? I thought I came to watch a movie , not a documentary\/fairy tale ? I know some groups are trying to shove global warming down people 's throats , but are you kidding me ? And to think , this was actually a remake of an original film ... It 's like my brain stopped working ... the lights are on but nobody 's home ... Duuhhhhhh ... -LRB- while drool falls from the mouth -RRB- ... What an uncreative story . Shocking ... alarmingly shocking ... " ,3

" Really really bad and insulting remake of excellent 50 's classic . Hollywood has been remaking a lot of movies lately with usually terrible results , and this is no exception . The scriptwriter has taken the original script , and rewrote it while apparently stoned or on coke . The original movie has an extremely clear storyline with no idiotic story twists , no decidedly crazy and astronomically improbable behavior like this one has in spades , and is excellent from first moment to last . This piece of sputum on the other hand will let you feel like you want to bash the characters heads in half of the time for being so stupid and outrageously insane . The most pathetic part of this movie is the fact that despite having state of the art special effects it ca n't hold a candle to the original , which had hardly any effects whatsoever , never mind special ones . True , it is not completely abysmal like , say , the day after tomorrow , and has at times decent acting . But good actors like John Cleese for instance are completely wasted in this movie , and even Reeves and Connely perform like wooden dolls at times . I wo n't spoil the end to you ; I do n't need to , it is bad enough that it will spoil itself . Script : Zero . . Done by a chimp and two stray dogs taken from the streets . Edmund North is rolling in his grave . Acting : far below average most of the time , sometimes OK Music : Music ? What music ? Effects : Made irrelevant by sheer lack of everything else ...

" the day the earth was ruined . When the credits started rolling at the end of the movie , I just sat there . I could n't believe that such a good movie had been ruined . Jaden Smith did n't ruin the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still , Scott Derrickson did . The original movie had a meaning and direction . With everything going on in the world today , the director could have used this to his advantage and really had a blockbuster . It 's too bad that some movie directors allows big business to lead them down an avenue to a dead end . That 's where this movie is headed . There 's enough commercials on TV , ca n't we leave the commercials out of the movies .

" The Day the Movies Stood Still . I was excited about seeing this film , but it did n't half disappoint ! I 'm not going to say much , because quite frankly I see no need to waste more of my time on this film ! But all in all it was a weak script laced with tacky moments , poor acting and pretentious special effects . And the kid 's character was possibly the most irritating part of the film . I feel bad for the actual kid as this will most likely follow him wherever he goes . Why was he there ??? He did n't provide any kind of emotive aspect to the film , he was just a spoiled , evil , backstabbing little squirt for most of it ; until at some point he decides Oh no wait , now I 've been to Daddy 's grave and had a good old cry , I 've realized that Helen is n't all that bad and I 'm gunna give her a hug now and call her -LRB- very conspicuously -RRB- Ma ! Really ????? There are so many other anomalies in this film , such as why would they fly the specially collected group of top scientists straight to where there was going to be an apocalyptic meteor crash ?!?! And where did these specially designed panels come from to contain GORT ? And let 's be honest here , there was no bottom to them , so I feel they missed a great comical moment of GORT simply lifting his cage over him and chucking it at a tank . And why kill that cop in such a violent way , only to bring him back to life again and walk off ?? There was a lot of potentially good moments in this movie that were left undeveloped , ultimately leading to a sense of apathy and frustration . Bad . " ,2
" This Movie Makes No Sense - Non Sequential and Emotionally Faulty . This movie looks like it was made in 1951 and the 1951 classic looks like it was made today . It is evident that movie making has not come a long way ; it has gone backwards . Scripts , lines , and acting means nothing in movies today and special effects make the movies look expensive . When will movie makers quit taking the public 's money and give it what it deserves ... a movie that time and heart went into . The movie shows scenes that are not relevant to anything . The beginning scene opens like there are questions that will be answered , but it is never touched upon again . The ending seems like the author could n't think of any good reason to save the human race so he just did it anyway . The script writer obviously has never felt any emotion or does not know how to write it . The only way someone could have wrote something this bad and nonsensical is if he were an alien himself . The script looks as if it was a cut and paste job from other people 's writings and work . No one can write that bad ... professionally ... I hope . Watch the movie and find out for yourself , but please do not pay any money that will end up in the hands of the filmmakers as they do not deserve a cent . " ,1
" This Movie Was Average At Best . MY REVIEW for The Day The Earth Stood Still -LRB- 2008 -RRB- I just saw this movie a few hours ago and I just thought to write a short simple review . Forgive me for any grammar mistake and spelling error . Before seeing the movie , I heard lots of bad things about it . So , I watched the movie while expecting it to be worse and worse as time passed by . Know what , the movie was not that bad at all , at least , for me . But it was not that great either . It was acceptable yet easily forgettable owing to the weak story despite having quite good performances mainly by the lead actress and great special\/visual effects . The opening scenes were intense and so mysteriously convincing . The beginning was fast-paced in a satisfying way and the movie kept me interested for the first few minutes , maybe even more than half of the movie . The movie contains some cool action scenes but none of them left any huge impact on me but as I said , I did keep my expectations low so that I would n't be too disappointed . In the end , the movie is average at best . The best thing about the movie was neither the Klaatu nor the special effects nor even the plot but the acting by some of the cast primarily by Jennifer Connelly . She was surprisingly good in her role and her acting was stellar and steadily good and quite convincing in this movie . The cast around the board was generally good . Keanu Reeves as the alien , Klaatu was also good as well to me but definitely could have been better . So was Jennifer Connelly 's acting but she was better in overall to me . Maybe Keanu has found his perfect role , maybe not . But in my opinion , I thought he was slightly better in Constantine than in this . Other than the cast , the visual and special effects were also quite satisfying and good but none of the actions I found to be breathtaking or astonishing . All in all , the effects were acceptable and OK and for some parts , great . But as I said , the movie did n't leave any huge impact on me . I was quite glad though that I was not too disappointed with the movie since I already reduced my expectations in the first place . It was a quite satisfying and acceptable cinema experience all in all . And , how predictable the ending is but still okay though given the stellar performance by the lead actress and some great special effects and action sequences . In my honest opinion , this is the kind of movie that is worth checking out once only . It will soon be forgotten I believe . 4\/10 " ,4
" And so a new # 1 worst film of all time - beating out Smilla 's Feeling for Snow . To summerise Unintelligble Plot Unimaginative Character Development Gaping Plot holes -LRB- I laugh at the use of the word plot here because it infers there was one they were working towards -RRB- Shudderingly bad ending Terrifyingly bad choices of locations The whole made no sense of the parts . If this was a `` B '' movie than it would probably score highly . But it was touted as a A list film , reminding us all to `` leave well alone '' that which you admire because either you do a scene for scene remake or you make a dogs breakfast like this one . Apart from that Keanau Reeves was good in the lead role - in my opinion - well not a lot of acting required really . " ,1
" Feeble , Poor And Would Be Lucky To Be Classed As Average . . The Day The Earth Stood Still . Drawn to watching this film from the staggeringly cool adverts and the lack of anything else to watch at that time , I sat down and readied myself for what I thought would be an impressive hour or so of smooth one-liners from Matrix-star Keanu Reeves and breath-taking CGI scenes . Instead , I was pummelled with disappointment after frustrating disappointment . When we are allowed our first glimpse of a 30ft buff mechano-man from outer space , I suppose in a way it was impressive , but in a world of films like `` Transformers '' and `` Beowolf '' there is nothing here that we have n't seen before but done a lot better . And at about 30 minutes into the film , I have yet to get rid myself of the thought that it just was n't worth the effort . Keanu is born into the movie in what looks like the snotty remains of a carcass , and the image of him , all naked and sticky on the table , is burned into our yet to be properly entertained minds . The instant dislike of the woman representing the president is predictable and gives away pretty much most of the storyline within minute . You know that the trigger-happy government will make all the mistakes and completely misunderstand the aliens . My problem with this is not the story line , because in all fairness , it was GOOD . There is a really good message behind it , and it 's being delivered at a time when it 's important to us all , what with Global Warming and all that . My problem is that it was all delivered badly . The script is full of irritating plot holes and nobody seems to be trying very hard to force any emotions out of their plain little faces . Thus , the characters are left as mere parts of the flat screen , instead of people we care about and relate to . Also , is it just me or are we all starting to get fed up of inevitable family relationships ? Step-mother -LRB- Kathy Bates -RRB- and step-son -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- try to make it all work out after father\/husband died and within seconds of understanding their `` difficult situation '' we know how it will all turn out . The few shots that are vaguely attractive are cut too short and book-ended by common and unoriginal ones . To sum up , there was nothing that stood out to me about this film . The music was feeble , the acting was poor and the CGI would be lucky to be classed as average . I was not the only one to sprint out of the cinema as soon as the expected fade to black arrives , one woman put her coat on just minute before hand , knowing the end was near and soon she would be free . Stay away , unless you wish to be smothered by another stereotypical apocalyptic blockbuster . " ,2
" Very disappointing . I was very disappointed in this movie . I never saw the original but I love alien movies and this one seemed like it could be nice . While watching it , it kept feeling like this picture had potential , but alas nothing comes from it . First of all when we first see Gort and he stops all the vehicles and missiles he looks awesome and then later he becomes a cloud ? WTF ? Clouds are n't scary or exciting and for some reason the cloud seems to eat certain things quicker than others ? Mainly the main characters . And then , the ending ! Never before has a movie had such a anti climax for an ending . What happened ? Nobody but the main characters know that they should change their ways . Not even Kathy Bates . Why would they ? And then the kid 's character is SO annoying ! He needs a decent hiding !! " ,1
" I thought it was only me . I am laughing at the people that actually had to pay money to see this pile of hot crap . I know , I know . It 's not a nice thing to laugh at other 's misery . But I 'm just picturing the expression on people 's face as they exited the theater and wondered out loud and to themselves if they just viewed a Hollywood big budget movie or some low budget B-movie production from film students . . Actually , it 's not funny anymore , now that I think about it . I could have been one of these people . . I was thankful -LRB- if you want to call it that -RRB- to see this movie for free , and I still wanted a refund from whomever green lighted this garbage . . I was watching this movie thinking it was one of those bad sci-fi movies on the sci-fi channel . I came on IMDb only to find out that my opinion of this movie was shared by a lot of my fellow movie critics . Oh well , I feel that I must do my part and warn people to NOT waste a dime paying to see this movie . . If you must watch it , just use as a guide as how to not make a movie , a re-make or to just laugh with friends at the bad production , bad script-writing , bad acting ... Trust me , sophisticated movie-goers , this movie is as Bad as advertised , if not worse . " ,1
" If you 've seen the trailer , you 've seen the movie . There is nothing in the movie that was n't in the trailer . Indeed , the trailer might have had a better plot . Here 's a short summary : Spaceman comes to earth . Earthlings freak out . US government reveals its arrogance through an unconvincing secretary of defense . Through an implausible series of events , spaceman meets earthwoman . Superintelligent spaceman taught a lesson or two by humble earthman . Tears . Spaceman must decide fate of world . Only things giving this three stars are the performances of Reeves -LRB- who does n't need makeup to look like a spaceman -RRB- and Smith . Everyone else seems to be sleepwalking . You could swallow all of that , but it seems the producers ran out of money for special effects pretty quickly -- which adds insult to injury in such a poorly conceived remake of a classic . The only reason to remake a classic sci-fi flick is to bump up the special effects , but I 'd guess the original must have had a bigger special effects budget than this remake . " ,3
" See the original . Extremely disappointing . The film had little to do with the original , and certainly lacked the elegance , simplicity , story line , focus , and character of the original . In fact , the remake has none of these qualities at all . Had this film been an updated re-telling of the original story it would have stood a chance . As it was , other than sharing the names Klaatu and Gort -LRB- and in the latter case , only barely -RRB- , and a vaguely similar story line , this film bears little in common with the original `` The Day The Earth Stood Still . '' That film made perfect sense , including the title ; the remake does not , and the title has little bearing on the story and frankly does not make sense . This film should have been called , `` They 've Come to Kill Us All , '' or `` Green Aliens and Their Message of Doom . '' The original was beautiful ; the remake is not . " ,2
" there is no spoiler - this remake was spoiled before it started . Why would someone , in fact , many people take the time to re-make a good movie into a bad one ? We can not answer that . We can only surmise . MONEY . Derrickson 's complete waste of time do-over is not only an insult to the original , but an insult to all of us that paid to see it . Recently , I was able to find out about his next project Not so unsurprisingly , it will be titled : Citizen Kane II . The likely cast has also been leaked . It will be starring Dom DeLuise as Charles Foster Kane . The ever-versatile Madonna will play the part of Susan Alexander Kane . Taking time off from his busy schedule ; Andy Richter will reprise the role of Jedediah Leland . And finally yet importantly , replacing Ray Collins as boss James W. Gettys : The incomparable Boy George . " ,1
" Good movie , annoying kid . Let me start this by saying that I have never seen the original movie , and do n't really plan to as I know the plot from this one . Reeves and Connelly were great as expected , and I wish Cleese had a longer role . The premise and the plot was interesting and original . The CGI effects were beautiful and convincing . All in all , very enjoyable movie . Now , the cons . The kid -LRB- Smith -RRB- was playing a very annoying character , betraying and insulting everyone - there 's no way he could be part of a reason anyone would like humanity . Oh , and that GORT looks like he 's taken straight out of 50 's sci-fi -LRB- probably is , once again I have n't seen the original -RRB- . A boring metal blob of a giant robot that destroys everything . The director should 've done like Michael Bay with Transformers , changing them from blocky bright-colored cartoons into beautifully detailed and utterly alien machines . He does make up for it a bit though by what the GORT turns into -LRB- not gon na spoil this -RRB- . One last thing , I wish I had seen this in IMAX instead of a TV screen . " ,9
" Little resemblance to the original . Did anybody in Hollywood watch the original ?? A remake of a classic should be a tribute , perhaps updated to current events , but not a complete rewrite that barely resembles its namesake . The 1951 version may have lacked color and 21st century special effects , but the plot stood on it 's own -- humans should not be permitted to screw up the rest of the universe . The 2008 remake portrays Klaatu as an alien in a human suit -LRB- flashback to Starman -RRB- sent to save the earth from the ignorant humans . Elimination of human civilization being Gort 's -LRB- giant Gort , by the way -RRB- prime directive until Klaatu Reeves decides humans may just be inherently good . Unfortunately , by this time Gort is now just a swarm of silly nanobots , out of Klaatu 's control . Michael Renne as Klaatu -LRB- 1951 -RRB- was sent as an emissary to convince humans that Earth could be part of the universal community -- if they could put aside cultural and political ego for the good of humanity as a whole . No advance spies , no hidden ships -LRB- spheres -RRB- , Klaatu was the only contact necessary to send to Earth . He had a message and he delivered it in a spectacular fashion . Gort was a peace-keeper created by the advanced civilizations to prevent aggression between them , but in 2008 Gort embarks on an apparently preprogrammed mission of annihilation totally antithetical to the original movie .

" proof that we live in a dumbed down world . take a great story with ideas and debate , then take out all the intelligent stuff , replace with hackneyed characters really banal dialogue , clich d troubled kid because dad has died , so he blames everyone , have a plot that just meanders without any tension or purpose , blow things up , and hey presto we have another dud and stupid remake . how this ever got into production is quite unbelievable , a script so bad if feels as it was written by a ten year old , direction so bad , has this director ever seen a decent film , does he not understand what makes a good film . and finally how could the studio heads have ever green lighted something this awful , did no one bother to watch the classic original , why did we need all the boring extra stuff , who cares how he becomes human , who cared about the kid , only one scene with the scientist , expounding anything of merit . like I Am Legend , this is a unbelievably bad and dumb rewording of a great and powerful film , avoid at all costs " ,3
" The day I felt really bad about spending 7 . . I 'm one of those people who always try to find the good things in a considerable bad film . Alas , that is not the case today . The film started off quite interesting , but I fell asleep around 20 minutes , maybe I was just tired , but I think it had something to do with the fact that it just did not interest me . To be fair , this film was randomly picked and neither me or my friend knew it was a remake . Do n't blame me for that , I 'm not into scifi and after viewing this film , I will never be . The special effects were nothing special , and although this is not necessary in a normal , good film , it should have been here , obviously because the dialogues and plot lines were awful . I 'm not gon na waste words on the actingperfomances . At the end of the film I just sat there , staring at the end credits in disbelief , because I had never seen something so bad in my entire life . And suddenly , when I walked outside , I really wanted to go to Mac Donalds and buy an LG - laptop . 2 stars for the effective productplacement . " ,2
" Hated it , but not for the reasons I expected . I knew I was going to hate this movie , but I felt duty-bound to see it so that I could criticise it from a position of knowledge . I knew I was going to hate it because I love the 1951 version as an important part of my childhood , and any imitation other than the kind of loving , insightful job Peter Jackson did on `` King Kong '' was bound to fail , and there was plenty of advance warning -LRB- beginning with the casting of Keanu Reeves -RRB- it was not going to be that . What I did n't expect was that it would be so bad in so many new ways . To start with , changing humankind 's risk to the universe from nuclear destruction to environmental destruction does n't make a lot of sense , nor does the idea that the earth is a valuable resource because it has multicellular organisms . -LRB- They started to develop the idea that the alien spheres were sampling terrestrial life - the spheres as `` arks '' - but did n't take it anywhere . -RRB- Homo sapiens , with all our faults , has to be the most interesting species on this planet , and while I sympathise with the idea of wiping us out and letting the earth take its chances of evolving an -LRB- other -RRB- intelligent species , that is hardly a likely alien policy . The idea of using a swarm of metal-eating nanobots to wipe humans out makes even less sense . The nanobots themselves , and whatever they use for power , are a blot on the environment that makes anything we do look relatively trivial . And when they could eat an articulated truck in seconds , why did it take them so long to make holes in a jacket ? Klaatu 's stopping of electricity in TDTESS 1951 was a warning , and a fine theatrical moment whose essence was that nothing moved , all at the same time . In 2008 , by switching lights off block by block , much of the dramatic impetus was lost . Gort -LRB- 1951 -RRB- 's height of 8 feet was quite enough for him to be fearsome - especially when he opened his eyelid and fired his death-ray . The threat when it began to open again on Patricia Neal and her delay in saying the magic words is one of the great moments of movie history . Why the makers of Gort -LRB- 2008 -RRB- thought so much bigger was any better is baffling . The creasing at Gort -LRB- 1951 -RRB- 's knees was preferable to Gort -LRB- 2008 -RRB- 's jointlessness . CGI ? - he might as well have been inflatable . Rather strikingly , Gort and Klaatu had no discernible relationship , Gort having nanobotificated by the time Klaatu needed help . The relationship between the two was at the heart of TDTESS 1951 -LRB- and in the short story , the punchline was that their relationship was the reverse of what we imagined -RRB- . With Gort 2008 not going anywhere , there was no particular point to him being humanoid - and indeed with Klaatu not being human , that was quite anomalous . And I have n't even started on the sentient beings . Jacob Benson -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- has to be the most irritating character since Jar Jar Binks . If Klaatu took him as a model , he 'd wipe out humankind without thinking twice . At the heart of TDTESS 1951 was the bonding between Bobby and `` Mr Carpenter '' -LRB- even though his mother would never have risked it today -RRB- . Of Keanu Reeves as Klaatu , enough has been said already -LRB- I think I was one of the first , but I 'm certainly not the last , to say he would have been better cast as Gort -RRB- . At least we were spared any attempt at the Christ-like characteristics that so much better suited Michael Rennie 's Klaatu . -LRB- While Rennie 's final message was just as fascistic as Reeves ' , his portrayal had a warmth that animated the whole movie - you \* cared \* whether he lived or died . -RRB- Jennifer Connelly at least did n't screw up the Patricia Neal part ; concerned mother , skilled scientist , human being , she did her best to hold the film together . It 's just a pity that she did n't get a single strong speech to defend the human race . `` We can change '' does n't quite cut it . I give it two points for the agreeably marbled spaceship , quietly mocking the beauty of the earth , and for Kathy Bates as Marion Allbright , sorry , Regina Jackson , who could neatly stand in for a mercifully invisible president . " ,2
" This thing needs a warning label . -LRB- Expletives reluctantly omitted -RRB- . OK , this is going to be short and off the top of my head because this film does n't deserve a lengthy or even thought out review . `` When The Earth Stood Still '' needs a warning label . It should read something like `` Caution : if your aesthetic sensibilities require films to have cohesion , sensible plot points , decent dialog and adequate if not captivating performances , then please avoid this film ! The producers will not be held accountable for any disappointment you may incur ! '' Unfortunately I ca n't sue to get my money back . And they had names , man ! Keanu ! Jennifer ! -LRB- Who still looks quite superb , thank you . Kudos Ms Connolly . -RRB- I mean seriously , Kathy Bates ? Was that really Kathy-Misery\/At Play In the Fields Of The Lord-Bates in that mannequin performance , reciting her lines as if reading from the cafeteria menu ? And the incessant commercials ! Windows . MacDonalds . And they did n't even try to weave the product placement into the story . Some people may try to be nice and point out that the acting was n't really all that bad , and that it was really the fault of the bland script ... or they may suggest that the message of the film outweighs its poor execution . Not ! Look , I was n't expecting revolutionary film-making . Just some nice big budget CG escapism . I like candy every now and then . But could n't t they have even tried to make a decent piece of work ? Is mediocrity now a requirement ? Even `` I Am Legend '' was better and that was ... well , I ca n't use the words I want to and expect this comment to be posted , but I have n't been this ticked since Ben Kingsley was used to trick me into seeing `` Species '' . Grrrrr ... `` Sexy Beast '' saved your butt , Ben ! Cause I was looking for ya ! - Seriously , I ca n't do this anymore . No more opening nights or even opening weekends on these big bucks CG fest flicks . From now on I am waiting until respectable word of mouth comes around before I spend my money ... or until they start using warning labels on this ` stuff ' . " ,3
" Well well well , what do we have here ? Another mediocre remake ? . I really do n't know why there are some people who defend remakes . I mean , for every good one , we get twenty crappy\/mediocre ones . Well ! The good news is that The Day the Earth Stood Still has some pretty CGI , and decent performances by Keanu , Connelly , and Cleese . The bad news is that the script and direction is worthless . The only reason why I wasted 5 dollars on this is because I have n't seen the original . I 'm sorry , but if the original director handled the script as uninspired and as empty as the director in the remake did , then my hopes for seeing the original will definitely fade . Talk about taking every scene from every disaster movie ever , and implementing them -LRB- YET AGAIN -RRB- in the most boring way possible . And its loaded with even more bland sentimentality ! The characters are cardboard cut outs of other characters from other movies . The scientific element in the movie started interesting when Klatuu reached Earth , but then became basic tripe all the way until the credits started . Even if the acting is good , it does n't change the fact that the characters were not well written . Jennifer Connelly and Keanu deliver effective performances , but to what purpose ? We do n't care about these one dimensional characters ! And what about Big Willie Style 's son you ask ? Well , he is very annoying as f \* ck . But what can you expect from a script as worthless as this ? At least he played the part that was given to him well enough to make us wish he suffers from irreparable damage . I see bright things for Will 's son , but this is n't the best way to showcase his talent , not in insipid movies such as this one . The only memorable thing in the acting department was John Cleese , who turned out a subtle , but effective performance as Professor Barnhardt -LRB- even if the screen time was minimal -RRB- . The only thing that worried me from this production is n't the constant product placement . Or its abundant use of clich s. Or its pathetic script . What worried me was that the director -LRB- Scott Derrickson -RRB- is working on Paradise Lost . On account of this , I conclude that the human race is definitely getting very close to extinction . 4.2 \/ 10 " ,4
" I 've seen the remake 2 days ago , and today I 've watched the old one from the 50 's . . `` Helen Benson : What were you , before you were human ? Klaatu : It would only frighten you '' And that quote missed the point of the original 's message . IMO , the original movie had a message , while the remake missed it all . Yes , it still keeps the people 's stupidity -LRB- which still exists in reality -RRB- , but in this remake , they decided -LRB- for some reason -RRB- to change `` placing nuclear missiles in the space '' , into a `` global warming and destroying the planet with our greedy existence '' . Oh yeah , that 's right , we already have nuclear missiles around our planet , so it 's not a bad thing anymore !? Let 's place it with global warming . In the next 50 years global warming will be `` ok '' so we will do another remake of this movie , but changing global warming into a. . . overused breathable air ! Do n't be ridiculous , this movie was not about saving the Earth from our stupidity , but saving `` ourselves '' -LRB- the human race -RRB- from our stupidity . And I think that was the reason it was told in 50 's , because manly ... it was not far after the first atomic bomb was used -LRB- Hiroshima in 1945 -RRB- and the first mass UFO encounters -LRB- aka . flying saucers -RRB- . It was a message that someone fits even today . So let 's take a look on the cast that is mostly interested me - Klaatu Klaatu with Keanu looks and sound like a robot or a monster hidden inside of a human body , while Klaatu in the old ones -LRB- by Michael Rennie -RRB- was a human just like us . And that was the point of , it made a mystery about who they were , because they might be as us - humans . The director went the easy way , explained that Klaatu is a some sort of beast inside a human body -LRB- the quote above -RRB- , and that we would be scared of it . Although , Keanu is a good actor for this movie , but the role he is playing was dumped down . Klaatu was a smart , peaceful and friendly guy . Klaatu in this remake is a soulless psychopath with stupid x-men-like powers . Seriously , why the hell did they give him special powers like bringing people from the dead ? Why ? The machine that brought Klaatu from the dead in the original movie was more logical and intelligent than this , unintelligent and stupid crap . And I also do n't like how they linked the theory of evolution in the movie . I 'm not a creationist , or evolutionist , or scientologist , I just think things are still not well explained yet , and the original movie was n't linked to neither evolution nor creationism . The only things I liked were : 1 . micro , nano robots that were able to eat us all -LRB- good idea for a quick , mass destruction -RRB- 2 . reference to the religion , with those `` arks '' -LRB- although , the idea of `` saving the planet '' is stupid right from the bottom -RRB- 3 . Special FX -LRB- which is a normal thing in todays Hollywood movies -RRB- After seeing this , I gave it 7\/10 , but after seeing the old one , I 'm giving it 3\/10 , because Mr Derrickson missed the point of the movie . He made another `` Oh noz ! Alienz want to destroy us again !! '' cartoon . " ,2
" Why did they even bother ? . I think the failings of this entire movie can be summed up in the closing scenes . Whereas at the end of the original version of the film there is a climactic appearance by Klaatu and Gort on their spaceship , during which mankind is informed of the danger its reckless behavior is posing to the rest of the universe and the imminent consequences of continuing on our self destructive path ... We are left to ponder his threat , and re-examine our place in the universe , and hopefully realize we need to abandon our current petty bickering between nations and rise above it to become citizens of a new and exciting galaxy !!! In the new version , at the end of the film they just LEAVE ! Completely unsatisfying . " ,3
" god bless America . Another syphilitic dose of the same bile drenched Hollywood disaster . I feel the title should really have been ` another movie for idiots ' All American , self loving cheese ... again !!! Lets give it up ! please ! We all know you want the world to know you love yourselves , we know you are ` trying to learn , understand and grow , but hey , make mistakes because your just god damn human ' plus many other , clich 'd well documented , other American ` god bless America ' values that could make a butcher vomit . We are n't buying it !! You are only fooling yourselves Enough is enough , come on Hollywood , make something decent with intelligent actors and scripts . I would have put my eternal soul on there being the words ' i speak for the united states of America ' line in there somewhere . Of course like independence day and all the other disaster movies its main focus is a major us city . Amazing how the aliens always seem to choose new york , central park , oh yeah , thats where id land my space ship ha-ha . Of course there 's the ` moral lesson ' in there and its spelt out for you , not once , but twice ! Keanue eventually tells her he 's come to ` save the earth from us ' WE are ruining it ! Really ? ... ohhh if only i knew , thank god Hollywood has spelt it out for me in a medium i can really understand and connect with . heehaw . She also repeats it twice , just in case there 's any ` elderly ' people in the audience . ` so you 've come to save earth , you come to save earth ... from us ' Dumb Dumb Dumb She also really does do a terrible job at the ` oh dear , I 've just realized the alien sat in my car has come to wipe out the human race ' look . Her expression was akin to someone who just discovered she packed salmon sandwiches for lunch , which she thought she might save for weekend , but in hind-sight , it does n't really matter . Shocking !!! If this is acting I 'm jack Nicholson and Anthony Hopkins rolled into one steaming hot ball of hot acting love . These people really get paid for this ??? Is n't it a little like a gymnast with poor balance . I thought acting skills were a pre-requisite of being an actor , possibly not . Badly scripted , extremely predictable and wooden performances all round . The brat was the most annoying element and was a ridiculous addition . Keanue is cast , as in matrix , as someone different to the rest of us , but still a human being . Amazing how he really can pull off the ` looks human , but without any real emotion ' performance exceedingly well . There 's a reason for this ... he cant actually portray any emotion . Which is commonly known as acting . When will Hollywood 's directors actually start using people who have character or at least pretend All in all , bad . Surprised i did n't hear the lines ` youre the best of the best ' and ` this is the greatest nation on earth ' etc etc , but you cant have it all . Feel sorry for john cleese . An intelligent gentleman who can act should ` NT have to resort to pretending to do equations , that blatantly mean nothing , on a black board with an super intelligent alien -LRB- who also cant act ;--RRB- -RRB- and use lines like ` hey , maybe we are n't so different after all ' but if you choose to sell out , then such is life . My advise , watch something else , in fact , anything else " ,2
" Great Movie ! Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role . . I loved the original and I loved this version also . A thoroughly engaging , intelligent movie . This was a very entertaining movie , that was well balanced in it 's use of action , dialog , music and drama . I had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised . The special effects are wonderful and not overplayed . The editing is not this fast style pop video nonsense , that leaves you feeling sick . On the contrary you can actually SEE what is happening . Listen to the dialog and watch how things cleverly unfold ! If you expect `` Transformers '' you will hate this movie , if you are more concerned with the human spirit and you like movies like `` Gattaca '' then you will like this too ! " ,10
" Huh ??? . Well , it has the same title and the major characters have the same names but this movie bears no resemblance to the original , in plot or quality . It 's a spoiler , but the 1951 movie 's signature line , `` Gort , Klaatu barata nikto '' has been nixed . I remember seeing this movie for the first time on late night TV at college and the day after there were Gort signs all over campus . It 's a signature that stays with anyone who has even seen the original . The signature of the remake -- boredom . It 's a stinker with a plot that barely makes sense . Keanu Reeves gives the only decent performance here ... everyone already believes he 's an alien . We do n't care about the characters ... the major emotion evoked is boredom . The special effects are nice but they are the only thing worth watching . The movie is intentionally dark with little color . And , of course , this movie was number one at the box office the weekend it was released . Hopefully , folks will read the reviews and stay away ! " ,2
" very bad remake of a very good classic . I have seen the 1951 film with Micheal Rennie maybe 3 or 4 times . Always watch it if its on TV . Its such a good movie . I was really looking forward to the remake with modern screen effects . Had told my wife to expect something awesome . Sadly , this movie flops . They had the opportunity to stick to the original plot and really go to town with Gort . Even the ending left one hanging in the air almost as if they ran out of money to end the film properly . Keanu Reeves wo n't be collecting anything for this movie . My advice , save your money and buy the DVD of the original . You will be less disappointed and have a truly magnificent movie to get out and watch every year . On a separate issue , if there are any directors reading this , the remake of King Kong hit the spot . There are many fabulous science fiction films of the fifties that really deserve a good makeover like `` When worlds collide '' . But , if you 're going to do the same thing as you did with this movie - do n't bother . " ,3
" You should see the original first -LRB- may be spoilers -RRB- . Although I understand what the director was reaching for here , he fell far short of his goal . I hate it when directors rely on CGI and limit dialogue . The CHANGE that people go through when faced with ultimate disaster does not happen as suddenly as it did repeatedly in this movie . From the first shot through the entire movie all transitional indicators were missing . You did n't feel the apprehension that led to that initial shot . You did n't witness the turmoil of the boy as realization of his error in judgment set in . I hope that these scenes were shot and simply did not survive the editing . If so we may see them in the director 's cut . The original movie was much more hopeful and emotionally charged than this one by a long shot . " ,4
" A Great Disappointment . I held high hopes for this remake . I 've been waiting a long time for someone to update this classic sci-fi movie , which , arguably , is the best of the genre . I dint have any objection to the casting of Reeves in the role of Klaatu . I think he did well in the role . My main problem with the film is that it failed to live up to it 's potential . Unlike the original there was no speech in which Klaatu made the purpose of his visit known . That fact makes the entire remake pointless . What good is the message if only a handful of people hear it ? Another great disappointment was GORT , or I should say the lack there of ! Granted the effects were excellent ! But GORT was under used and was never the world destroying sword of Damocles as he was in the OG . Overall I found the film entertaining but it lacked the focus of the OG and in the end failed to live up to its potential . This movie just reinforced why classic films should not be remade . " ,3
" Hold still , I said ! . Just saw the movie at the screening for reporters and came here to see opinions of other people and was surprised to find none . I guess Croatia had the first screening of the movie . wow :-RRB- Anyways , I did n't watch the original movie from 1951 but have a feeling all the main points of the plot are there . I respect that but also feel this is the main reason why movie is so one sided and has a lot more potential to it . First third of the movie is paced really nice , but trough second and last part tempo kinda slows down and you pretty much know exactly what 's gon na happen . This movie is all about big message for humanity but the message it self is poorly developed . Acting is very good and main role is perfect for Keanu Reeves , being a neutral alien with no emotions :-RRB- -LRB- do n't get me wrong , i love his work -RRB- . Jason Smith who plays the kid will remind you why you sometimes hate the little brats . Story it self has some major flaws -LRB- biggest of them being : aliens have no idea what is love and they are not that intelligent -RRB- but I am guessing all of these were taken from the book\/original movie and after all , this is a remake . It would be much better if they had loosen up a bit and added some deeper sens to the whole experience . This way , I 'm guessing , there will only be a small group of people who will really appreciate this work . However , from technical point of view , this movie goes pretty far . It 's shot good , sfx are almost perfect , but music is kinda dull and editing should also be better . All this critic and such a high rating ? Yeah . . well , the movie has atmosphere and besides all it will hold you down to your seat through whole show . I also did n't check my watch during it , which is a very good sign , so at the end I would recommend this film that finally fills a part of the big hole in fiction genre . " ,8
" A really good try , but what starts out as something potentially great ends up only a little above average . Yes , this is yet another remake from the `` Hollywood Machine , '' and as with all others that came before it , the announcement of this one was met with anger from film buffs all over . The original , nearly 60 years old , is considered a classic of Scientific Fiction . I myself have yet to see it , so I ca n't compare the two , but I did n't mind that this was a remake and went into it with an open mind . The film showed great promise . An all-star cast , a talented director who seems to get better with each film , striking visuals , and a good premise . Now this of course is n't the first of the 1950s Sci-Fi flicks to get remake . In 2005 we saw a new ` War of the Worlds ' and in 2007 a third update of ` Invasion of the Body Snatchers ' in the simply titled ` The Invasion . ' Both have their supporters , but neither really did that well at the box office and reviews were mixed , especially for the latter . But I guess they both did well enough that other studios felt updating other genre classics was a smart move . Come 2008 we have this latest addition and so far it too has n't sparked too much excitement and after seeing it for myself , I can see why . The film that showed so much promise , is far from failure , but will not be thought of as a classic as the original is and always will be . Pros : A stellar cast , great performances from all . Director Scott Derrickson showed promise in ` Hellraiser : Inferno ' and has proved to be a strong force in the director 's chair . He keeps things moving , handles the action well , and creates stunning visuals . Tyler Bates composes a strong score . For the most part the CGI is very good . Moves at a fast pace . Some decent action scenes . A few good shocks . Cons : Sometimes the CGI is too obvious and hurts the impact of some scenes . Jaden Smith is a good actor , but his character is so poorly written . He 's so rude and bratty . This starts out like it will be a film with more depth and substance than most , but is executed in such a simple and straight-forward way . Things wrap up too quickly . Final thoughts : It 's such a shame when a film has such a great cast , looks so good , has some good ideas , and is n't dull , but has such a bland script . So much more could have been done with this but instead of escaping the clich s and going outside of the box , the makers of the film played it safe and gave us something that looks good on the outside , but lacks substance . If you go in with low expectations and view this as little more than a popcorn movie with an A-List cast and direction you might enjoy it . My rating : 3.5 \/ 5 " ,7
" A Simple Review of a Simple Problem in Hollywood ... . The Day The Earth Stood Still remake is a poor movie and a terrible remake . Forgive me , since I just wasted nearly two hours watching it I have not the patience to spend more than 10-minutes warning others . Judged on it 's own , it 's merely slow , stupid , and uneventful -LRB- with some weak performances thrown in for good measure -RRB- . Judged in comparison to the 50s classic , it essentially lets you down in every possible area . To wit , the original had The Cool Ship , The Impressive Giant Robot , The Deep Message and , oh , the Earth Standing Still ! The remake blows every last one of those , even the Earth standing still is less effectively done and seemingly without purpose , which brings me to my original point . Hollywood has forgotten how to tell a good story ! They 've forgotten that a good story must have purpose and some believability and reason and that we need to care about somebody or something . Mark my words , if the industry is to be saved , they need help from someone who can read a script like this and ask intelligent questions ; questions like : What 's the purpose in the kid being so bratty ? Who shot Klaatu and what triggered it ? How can we believe that the US has the equipment technology to move something like Gort , and why did we develop it -LRB- for the previous 50ft killer robot -RRB- ? Why would the Secretary of State -LRB- or did she say Defense -RRB- just follow orders to attack Klaatu when she knows they 've exhausted everything and gotten nowhere ? Why would a civilization as advanced as Klaatu 's need to have a face-to-face at a McDonalds ? Why did n't the we see the UN convene over this world crisis ? And the kicker for me : Why would n't Helen -LRB- Connely 's character -RRB- have called the Secretary -LRB- Kathy Bates -RRB- and told her this simple and vital sentence : `` If any harm comes to Klaatu we are doomed , he 's the only one who can stop the swarm of destructo-bugs . '' If they could clear the highway for her to at the beginning of the movie , would n't they do at least that to save all humanity ! Let us pray for Hollywood , else , they have n't got a prayer !

" The day my life stopped still . My initial groans at the dialogue and absurd actions of the military gave way to shock that any studio had the courage to release this film . However , as the antics continued I became more and more hooked . What new levels of stupidity in the plot could be reached in the final hour ? I was on the edge of my seat . By the end I was not disappointed , The Day the Earth Stood Still had successfully become one of the worst stinkers I 've ever seen . The decision for Keanu to play Klaatu , an alien devoid of human emotion , was inspired . I 'm not going to criticise Keanu , it was a typical performance from him . But that whining , little kid . Whine , whine , whine . He was even more unnecessary than Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars movies . If he died at the end , I would have given it 10 stars . I will recommend watching this movie to my friends , it is quite simply unbelievable . " ,1
" Oh no , not again ... ... . The day the earth stood still ?? more like the day my brain stood still . I have to say I 'm a fan of Keanu reeves , but how on earth did he get caught up in a movie like this ?? they must have paid him an awful lot of money up front , percentage of the takings would n't have been a good idea . Mind you I could say the same for Kathy Bates -LRB- another great actor -RRB- but I wont bother . Being fair , some of the special effects were OK but overall it was a very disappointing film , with a flimsy plot and dreadful story line . In effect , Jennifer Connelly asks the Alien -LRB- Keanu -RRB- to let the human race have another chance , `` Go on , pleeeease , we 'll change , honest '' and in the end he says , `` yeah , OK I 'll try to stop the destruction '' , The End . It 's not even eye candy , a very very poor film . " ,1
" Do n't put the woman in charge !!!!! . Starts off brightly enough when we discover something cataclysmic may be happening and an elite team is being put together by ... you guessed it ... the Americans . We go on to discover that an unknown object is hurtling toward Earth at thousands of miles per hour and will impact somewhere on the East Coast approximately smack in the middle of Central Park which has obviously recovered from Clovy 's attack . One of the elite team opines that it will scour the earth when it hits which from me would have set my sphincter on edge as the team member mentions this just as we approached ... you guessed it ... Manhattan Island . So we have established that something monumental is happening and that the people in charge are complete and utter idiots . Surely the team should be heading as fast as they can in the opposite direction ? What use will they be when they are all blasted to atoms ? But as luck would have it the object is a giant Xmas bauble and just in time slows down and lands . As well as the idiot elite team we are joined by the US army and NYPD who also are too stupid to flee in the opposite direction . Then the bauble opens and out steps a seemingly friendly but obviously stupid alien who declares war by extending a hand and is promptly shot . Ooops ! As said alien is comforted by the obligatory pretty scientist who should appear but ... you guessed it ... a bloody big robot who p \* ssed that his boss was shot the second he landed is about to kick some human ass and wake up this movie only for ... you guessed it ... stupid alien to recover a bit and shout some meaningless drivel and robot takes a break . Thus ends the decent 10\/15 minutes and begins the utterly incomprehensible last 75 as we find out that George W is hiding in a shoe cupboard and has put a rather sinister and completely insane woman in charge . The alien is then told he is being held by the USA in a secure facility , threatened with torture and confined whilst his robot mate after being attacked with sidewinder missiles is encased in a box . Why did the mad woman imagine that a spaceship that has traveled billions of miles would give a monkeys that a few pathetic missiles were fired at it . Have none of these people ever seen a movie before ? Cue a truly pathetic interrogation scene where alien kicks interrogators ass and steals his suit . Though what the point was of asking the guy his suit size is beyond me . If it had been too big or small would the alien have asked the interrogator to send in a thin bloke about six foot with a 34 inch leg ? Alien then legs it and hooks up with pretty scientist and her totally annoying step kid who ruins completely whatever shard of credibility was left after the first half hour . We then discover to our horror that stupid alien and his robot have come to ... you guessed it ... cleanse the Earth of US as we are destroying the planet with all out tomfoolery ... . A filler scene , during an advert for McDonalds , with stupid alien A talking about bugger all with another stupider alien B , who is for no discernible reason living here , is then rapidly followed by an even more pointless scene with a has been Brit comedian Professor where alien discovers we are not so bad after all . Helped by a bit of Bach along the way although I wonder what would have happened in the Prof had been listening to Motorhead . Stupid alien looks across room in wonder . Prof says ... ` it 's Lemmy from Hawkwind ' ... alien says ` it 's beautiful ' . Alien begins to warm to us by being in direct proximity to pretty scientist and annoying brat who at one stage wants to kill alien . But alas we are running short of time and budget so all hell breaks loose as robot turns into a swarm of insects and kicks ass at last . Cue a lot of pointless army guys firing rockets and stuff and a general reports to mad woman in charge who asks where the swarm is going ... ` it 's going everywhere ' ... . ` but mainly central Park ' . A couple of bits of destruction and a few pointless scenes between alien and annoying kid later we find that alien has now seen the error of his ways and plans to help us . Back in central park under the rebuilt bridge from Cloverfield we find ourselves within the swarm of destructive insects that have destroyed everything in their path but seem incapable of damaging the bridge . Alien says he can stop this but the price will be high . Cue absolutely rubbish last 5 minutes and that is it . A truly horrendous sci-fi blockbuster . Has Hollywood not learned yet that cutesy kids and dogs should die horribly in the first 20 minutes to give the audience some light relief . The original was a great topical movie and this could have been as well but it degenerates rapidly into the formulaic Hollywood blockbuster with cruddy effects and a script written by an idiot who seems not to comprehend just how stupid the actions of his characters really are . Unlike many here I am not down on Keanu as I like the guy a lot but the actors can only work with the slop they are given and this was sewage . " ,1
" Why ? . I was really looking forward to a big budget version of what is best described as an interesting low budget sci-fi flick , made 50 + years ago . What I was presented at the theater was a piece of garbage so badly written I do n't even think the Sci Fi channel would run it and that 's pretty bad ... I 'd blame the actors for bad performances but they honestly do n't have anything to work with here . What a mess , the end result is a dated , poorly executed , unbelievable plot that makes no sense in the end if you can make it to the end . If I could only have that 90 minutes of my life back . " ,1
" I 'll keep this very simple . The day the earth stood still was the day this film 's script , budget and cast was greenlighted by a Hollywood studio . Absolutely terrible on all fronts . Weak story line , poor acting -LRB- unfortuantely almost hand in hand with Keanu -RRB- and poor cast -LRB- the kid in the film I can assure you will confirm this for you -RRB- . Do n't let this film paralyze you with boredom and terribleness like it says in the title . Avoid at all costs . I repeat ... Avoid at all costs ... over . " ,1
" bad movie about bad aliens again . man , once again aliens want to destroy the earth ... have i mentioned how i hate this stereotype ? they always travel huge distances to destroy us or our planet - we must be important ;-RRB- this time they are doing it out of some silly ethical reasons - we are destroying the earth , so they will do it first - no comment so here some logical mistakes : - they take samples of the flora and fauna of the planet - does it mean the nano bugs will destroy everything ? even the flora and fauna ? if so - why ca n't they take the samples and let the earth be ? if not - why do they need the samples ? how far is their genetic engineering and their planet creation\/rebuilding skill ? nano bugs eating pollution for example ? or creating more of endangered species , so they are not endangered anymore ? - from an ethical point of view the aliens are behaving quite unintelligent too - they have no responsibility whatsoever for either us , our planed or the life on it . they could provide us with better technology so we do n't destroy the earth and can live in space if they feel some responsibility ... but this would n't be such an dramatic movie , would it . - sending an ambassador out of the ship when it is surrounded by military is not intelligent at all , especially when he is not invincible . why is n't he wearing a nano-bug-armor ? they have knowledge of the human body , but just did n't care to understand how we are thinking ? - the ambassador initially wants to get to the UN , so they have studied us a bit after all -LRB- never mind not understanding our concept of military -RRB- . but they seemingly have no idea that the UN is quite powerless - they should have attended one of the G8 summits instead . or summoned the big industry guys ... and why is it the ambassador has always to go to the USA - there is a UN headquarter in Vienna . - the idea of sending an ambassador vs sending their message on all TV channels and thus reaching all people without even landing and causing this panic ... what do you thing is better ? some other points : - they have studied us for a while , decided to destroy us and suddenly change their mind because of what ? i really could n't understand why they would stop ? do they believe we will change ? do you ? i think not without the giving us some technology . - the alien ambassador just looks at some formulas on a black board and knows what it is and why it is wrong ... i study informatics and have a lot of math - you just ca n't know all the formulas and even if you do you wo n't always recognize them , since there are different ways to say the same . so - bad script , the acting disappointed me too - no point in watching this one . " ,1
" The best of Hollywood . The movie is a comical masterpiece , thoroughly enjoyable as unintentional comedy - the kind that is made with the straightest of faces . I wish for once Aliens landed in a Mexican village and not in New York or Los Angeles . I wish for the world to be saved or doomed by someone other than American Presidents and their bravery or stupidity . Just for the sake of diversity , no other reason ! Other clich s : good scientists vs. evil governments , dumb generals stuck in MAD mode , love conquers all , and so on - you got ta love this stuff . The idea of a superior alien civilization trying to put sense into the human race is pretty ridiculous . Just as stupid as putting an alien to a lie detector . Or having the said Alien meet another fellow alien in a McDonald 's joint , speaking Chinese . The shameless McDonald 's product placement is another stroke of moronic genius , and that scene will have anyone rolling on the floor laughing . The encounter between Klaatu and the Nobel laureate was , again , laugh - out-loud clich . Klaatu listens to Bach and has a sudden revelation on human duality . The Alien and the Man seem to share a mathematical language , so they gaze at each other and feel a connection . We are not that different after all . How deeply touching ! Now for the truly bad parts : the ungrateful , obnoxious little brat played by the child of a famous actor . This character is so ANNOYING , he spoils every single scene . Keanu 's performance is in the so bad it 's good category , and it 's fascinating . The whole movie would be in the same category if it was n't for the damn annoying brat . " ,9
" Good , if a little sentimental but insightful , propaganda film . I am not sure why this film did n't do better in the public consciousness . I do know that many resented it 's remaking given that the original film -LRB- which I am ashamed to say I have not seen -RRB- is very popular and a sci-fi cult classic . The film is less than loosely based on the novella by Harry Bates entitled Farewell to the Master , but is so removed from the original story as to be inconsequential . I liked the story but prefer the film . The film is basically about an alien -LRB- Klaatu - Keanu Reeves , perfectly cast , even from the book -RRB- who comes to Earth to save it , from the human race . We - generally the Americans - are shown as arrogant , egocentric , violent and not very bright ; Kathy Bates , US Secretary of Defense shames herself into thinking that she speaks for all mankind just because she speaks for the President of the USA , and she is very much shown to be the villain . Enter Jennifer Connelly -LRB- Astro-biologist , Dr Helen Benson -RRB- and John Cleese -LRB- Nobel laureate Biologist -RRB- to try and change his mind . A stellar performance by Jaden Smith as Jacob , Helen 's stepson with whom she has a turbulent and difficult relationship , which we see develop and his character is exactly who a boy of his age would be ; angry , scared and idealistic but also reliant on adults - his character has a lot of touching moments , very well acted . We as humans are not painted at all well , but realistically , I think , and the film is propaganda for the idea that we ARE killing our planet and we WILL destroy ourselves in destroying it . We do have to unite in peace and ecofriendly togetherness if we are to survive . I feel it is a fairly truthful imagining of what might happen if an ET did land in Central Park , and the SFX are good , the story gripping - quite tense - and whilst this is rather Hollywood , it does n't end in quite the way you would assume , and is incredibly poignant . All performances were good , well judged and not overdone , and the Direction and overall realisation of the story excellent . " ,7
" The earth did n't stand still for me . Being a great fan of the original film , and having read some pretty dire reviews of this remake , I was pleasantly surprised by the impressive opening sequences . However , once Klaatu emerged from his chrysalis-like shell , it all went rapidly downhill . The premise of the original was that advanced civilisations , having become aware of the destructive power of humans , sent an emissary -LRB- Klaatu , the imposing Michael Rennie in the original -RRB- to warn us that if this destructive power threatens interplanetary peace -LRB- kept by intergalactic ` policemen ' symbolised by the giant robot Gort -RRB- then said intergalactic policemen will have no option but to destroy us . The power wielded by these robots is demonstrated when Gort , instructed by Klaatu , makes the earth ` stand still ' by stopping all electronic and telecommunications except those required to run emergency systems , such as hospitals . Those of us belonging to the immediate post-war generations can readily identify with the fear of nuclear weapons : the ` bomb ' was a very real threat in those days . And while the original film script showed a rather naive belief in the power of scientists to prevent catastrophe -LRB- after all , who built the bomb in the first place -RRB- , at least it left room for discussion . The 2008 remake plays instead on modern fears : climate change , although having this rammed down one 's throat at every possible opportunity is likely to result in widespread boredom and indifference . Never mind that we can not , as yet , determine the extent to which humans are responsible for the current trend -LRB- after all , climate change has always been a feature of our planet , and always will be -RRB- ; the alien civilisation -LRB- s -RRB- which have sent Klaatu to earth have decided that it 's our fault , no contest , and we must Mend Our Ways . This is where a distinct lack of logic and credibility creep in . A civilisation capable of creating weapons of mass destruction and - possibly , in the future - also capable of space travel , could pose a very real threat to intergalactic peace . But why would alien civilisations give a toss if we muck up our own planet - even assuming that 's possible in the first place -LRB- life on earth will go on , in some form , regardless of what we do to the planet -RRB- ? And the means used to Teach Us A Lesson are , in themselves , destructive -LRB- if the nanoparticles released by Gort can destroy buildings , humans and vegetation , is that not throwing the baby out with the bathwater ? In the end , the special effects , impressive as they are , ca n't make up for the film 's lack of coherence . Whereas in the original Gort exuded real , terrifying menace -LRB- no mean feat given the creaky effects -RRB- , and Klaatu comes across as sympathetic even when warning us about our destructive behavior , in the remake Gort is simply there , doing nothing , until he -LRB- it ? -RRB- dissolves into a cloud of destructive particles . Surely they did n't need Gort for that ? Why bother with a giant robot ? And it 's difficult to have any feelings at all about Reeves 's Klaatu , except the sense that he 's really a crashing bore . Rather like much of the film , in fact . " ,3
" Say your prayers and goodbye ; the world will end tonight ... . Remaking one of the ultimate greatest Sci-Fi milestones must be the most courageous and ambitious ideas ever or , one of the stupidest ever . The number of Sci-Fi\/horror remakes unleashed upon us in the last 10-15 years is countless , but directors usually restrict themselves to remaking smaller and more modest cult gems so that , in many cases , a large share of the target audience does n't even know it 's a modern update of an older movie . Of course , if you plan to makeover one of the most recognizable and worshiped titles in the history of cinema , skeptical critics and film fanatics all over the world are ready to demolish your effort and call it blasphemy . But hey , my mother always taught me to be open-minded and never judge anything from beforehand , so there ! Besides , there are a handful of elements to be carefully optimistic and assume that the new version of The Day the Earth Stood Still would nevertheless be worthwhile ; most notably , the name of the director . Scott Derrickson debuted with Hellraiser : Inferno , which is in fact the only watchable sequel in the entire franchise , and subsequently surprised everyone with the rather unique and absorbing court-horror movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose . Furthermore the film seemed to dispose of a wide enough budget for dazzling special effects -LRB- always nice in case of an apocalyptic saga -RRB- and a promising cast including Kathy Bates and John Cleese . Let me start by stating that I too am a huge fan of Robert Wise 's 1951 original . This is undeniably one of the most influential and genre-defining films ever accomplished and I still vividly remember the overwhelming impact it had on me when I first saw it . So , regardless of how objective I tried to remain , I automatically compared even the smallest detail of this movie with the original , and then it simply is a failure from every possible viewpoint . In case there are still people unfamiliar with the plot : a collective of superior alien races , with technologies and wisdom far more advanced than ours , send their spokesperson Klaatu , along with his enormous 28ft pet robot Gort , to earth with an ultimatum : stop destroying the planet or face the disastrous consequences . The transfer of this message already goes horribly wrong , as the humanoid alien is immediately gunned down by nervous policemen as soon as he lands his giant space ball in the middle of Central Park . Humanity is even more petrified when Gort somehow deactivates all their artillery and vehicles . When Klaatu then still remains unable to pass his message to the right authority figures , he orders to launch project apocalypse . Mankind 's last string of hope lies with single mother Helen Benson , who unconditionally attempts to save the stepson that disrespects her . Of all the defaults in this film , varying from small to more than medium sized , there are one or two things that bothered me enormously . The aliens ' message stop destroying planet earth remained somewhat too vague and unmotivated . In the original -LRB- sorry for the comparison -RRB- the warning was clearly linked to the post WWII political turmoil and development of nuclear weapons . What exactly is the -LRB- biggest -RRB- problem this time ? Terrorism linked to religious warfare ? Global warming ? Industrialization ? A combination of everything ? Be more specific , will you Klaatu ! I expected tragic images of families torn apart by warfare or animals dying due to the changing of the climate , but nothing . Secondly , the monumental intergalactic robot Gort is really disappointing this time around . He may have increased 20ft in size in comparison to the original movie -LRB- sorry , again -RRB- but he also looks about 20 times less menacing . The dialogs are weak , there are far too many exaggeratedly fake melodramatic touches and the vast majority of the characters are downright bland . Scott Derrickson also never truly manages to generate an atmosphere suitable for the slowly approaching cataclysm . The special effects are indeed bombastic , fancy and plentiful but sadly they 're either irrelevant to the actual plot -LRB- like the landing of the space ship -RRB- or too grotesque . I did like the whole swarm concept near the end , though , for which I 'm giving the film an extra point . " ,4
" You ad me , then you lost me . Like ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' , ` Psycho ' and ` The Omen ' this is one of those remakes that irritated me on general principal . Why Hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were perfect in their original form is beyond me . Well , we all know it is because of a lack of interesting ideas , but I digress . The original version of this film is arguably the greatest science-fiction film ever made . If not the best , it is most certainly in the Top 10 . Saying all that about halfway I found myself actually enjoying this one . It seemed quite different from the original , and I must admit I found myself liking some of the differences . For example , I liked the idea of an almost birth-like process in the development of Klaatu . I 'm neither a Keanu Reeves fan nor a Keanu Reeves hater , but I liked his performances as Klaatu . The problem for me came when the whole leftist global warming agenda became the reason for Klaatu 's mission . As a libertarian , I 'm not a believer in the man-made global warming scam . Either way Klaatu 's statement that if man lives the planet dies , if man dies the planet lives is rather absurd . Even if there is man-made global warming , it will kill humans , but the planet itself will recover as it always has throughout its existence . As George Carlin once said , The planet is n't going anywhere ... we are ! There are plenty of other things that will cause human extinction before global warming -LRB- superflu , asteroid , etc. -RRB- , so the major plot point became absurd to me . Hence the rating . " ,4
" Woeful and infuriating . Before I begin this review I feel that I should mention that I have never seen the original . So I will judge this movie on its own merits . It is very rare that a movie will actually bring me to anger . But this insipid , preachy mess of a movie succeeded . In fact even as I write this review I can feel my fingers start to clench up in anger . This is a movie that makes my brain hurt . This is a movie that upon seeing it at the cinemas made want to run out onto the streets and scream obscenities while smearing the movie posters with my own feces ... err anyway on with the review . So it begins with the arrival of an alien by the name of Klaatu played by a cardboard cutout of Keanu Reeves and his pet robot by the name of Gort played by Woeful CGI -LRB- hmmn he 's been in a lot of movies lately -RRB- . I was immediately reminded of all those dictators you see on the evening news , you know like Saddam or Magabe . They usually had thugs enforcing there draconian laws too . Perhaps Klaatu is interested in politics . But no he has much bigger ideas . He is here making sure that we humans are behaving ourselves and living by his principles . And whether to leave us be or wipe us out . You know kind of like Hitler . Now this normally would n't bug me in a movie if he was the villain . But no the villain of this drek is humanity itself . We brought this on ourselves . And so Klaatu unleashes Gort onto the world after 7 hours of green idealism . So after mercilessly killing untold numbers of Innocent people . Klaatu is suddenly moved by the pleas of a woman who 's named slips me right now played by Jennifer Connelly and lets the rest of us live but we were not allowed to have technology . This movie is like a dimwit trying to sound smart . The hypocrisy of killing a whole race of people because some are violent towards others is breathtaking . Yet this movie gets behind Klaatu as if he was the merciful one . This is extreme environmental Proganda . Which is Ironic when you consider that Klaatu 's actions mirrors those of Goerge W Bush when he tried to enforce his ideology on Iraq . This is film making at its worst . " ,1
" A good sci-fi film that does not disappoint . ` The Day the Earth Stood Still -LRB- 2008 -RRB- ' had some really very big shoes to fill , being a remake of the original film of 1951 directed by Robert Wise and widely -LRB- and deservedly -RRB- considered as one of the all-time sci-fi classics . The basic premise of the movie involves a visit of the alien Klaatu -LRB- played by Keanu Reeves -RRB- to earth with a certain goal to fulfill . Klaatu is not an overwhelming entity per se , nonetheless he has an agenda and soon we realize that too much is at stake here . It is a well done movie that stays close to the original film without big surprises or additions , except the special effects introduced by the computer generated animations . Keanu Reeves is a competent actor and creates a believable character that interacts with humans and shows signs of internal struggle for his actions . Regular sci-fi moviegoers will not be disappointed here . A 7\/10 from me . " ,7
" Disappointing in nearly ever way . . Change his mind . Not with reason , but with yourself . A mysterious alien presence arrives on earth , causing chaos , confusion , and many questions . Primarily , why is it here ? Is this humanity 's hour of judgment , or salvation ? I really do n't know how I found The Day The Earth Stood Still to be bearable enough to finish . It 's clunky , often boring , and heavy-handed in a way that good science fiction never is . The worst flaws are the script and dialogue , which are simply terrible . Poor Jennifer Connelly often looks like she ca n't believe the words that are coming out of her mouth , and the other actors do n't have it any better . I like Keanu Reaves , but here he is somehow still too stiff and emotionless for a character that 's SUPPOSED to be stiff and emotionless . Dull subplots focusing on annoying characters somehow make an already boring movie even worse . There 's really not even an memorable action or special effects scenes to make things interesting , even briefly . There 's no emotion here , no excitement , nothing to engage the viewer . The Day the Earth Stood Still is just an empty experience . " ,3
" Hollywood , Reeves try to ruin another classic film . Originally published on Dec. 8 , 2008 : I 'm angry . Yes , I think I 've finally reached my breaking point on bad and unnecessary movie remakes . This is not a new phenomenon , but it seems recently more and more are being ripped off from superior films . And I think I 've been very tolerant , sitting through pale imitations of better originals such as The Manchurian Candidate , The Invasion , Poseidon , Psycho , Planet of the Apes , The Heartbreak Kid , The Shaggy Dog , All the King 's Men , King Kong , Alfie , War of the Worlds , Yours , Mine and Ours , Cheaper By the Dozen , Thomas Crown Affair , Gone In 60 Seconds , The Producers , Hairspray , Father of the Bride , Bad News Bears , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , Halloween , Flight of the Phoenix , Mr. Deeds -LRB- Goes to Town -RRB- , The Exorcist and Around the World in 80 Days . Just to name a few ... Hollywood , it seems is also so bereft of ideas that the industry even remakes bad films into worse ones , i.e. . The Fog , Amityville Horror , The Alamo , Fun With Dick and Jane , Texas Chainsaw Massacre , The Hills Have Eyes The Longest Yard , Walking Tall , Stepford Wives and Prom Night . What is it that makes actors , directors , writers and\/or others think that they can produce a movie better than Alfred Hitchcock or John Ford or Stanley Kubrick or Robert Rossen or William Friedkin or Sam Peckinpah or John Frankenheimer or John Waters , among others ? Is it the lack of any original concepts or just a plain gargantuan ego ? Some say the updating of technology adds a lot to these new versions , but I can not agree . It takes more than just massive doses of CGI to improve an original work . All I can say is that I am more than tired of watching these new individuals try to massage their own bizarre fantasies . But , as a man of peace , I was more than content to go along with this Tinsel Town charade , safe in the knowledge that I can still watch the motion pictures these inferior remakes were based upon . However , with the release this week of The Day the Earth Stood Still , starring Keanu Reeves , I can no longer contain my smoldering anger . The original 1951 film , directed by Robert Wise -LRB- who later won Oscars for West Side Story and The Sound of Music -RRB- , told the tale of an alien craft landing in Washington , D.C. . A suave extraterrestrial , Klaatu -LRB- Michael Rennie , The Robe -RRB- , informs the human race they must cease the nuclear arms race and to stop all the fighting , or the planet will have to be destroyed . He is backed by a huge indestructible robot named Gort , so people start to fall in line . The picture also starred Patricia Neal -LRB- who won a Best Actress Academy Award for Hud in 1963 -RRB- , Sam Jaffe -LRB- nominated for The Asphalt Jungle -RRB- , Hugh Marlowe -LRB- All About Eve , Meet Me in St. Louis -RRB- , Billy Gray -LRB- Father Knows Best -RRB- and Francis Bavier -LRB- best known as Aunt Bee on The Andy Griffith Show -RRB- . There are many reasons why this newest version was the straw that broke my back . First of all , it stars Keanu Reeves . Second , it changes the whole nuke premise to a showdown on global warming . Politically correct AND Keanu Reeves what 's next , Al Gore in the lead role in E.T. ? Here , Reeves plays a sleepwalking Klaatu -LRB- think Mr. Spock meets Steven Wright on downers even more low key than Reeves usually appears on screen , if that 's remotely conceivable -RRB- who tells the nations of the world that they are ruining the Earth and if they do n't knock it off , bad things will happen -LRB- look , being forced to watch this tripe is punishment enough -RRB- . Even the inclusion of two past Oscar winners , Kathy Bates -LRB- as a disbelieving Secretary of Defense -RRB- and Jennifer Connelly -LRB- failing the Patricia Neal role completely -RRB- does not help . And former Monty Pythonite , John Cleese , subbing for Jaffe 's professor , is n't enough . Then , of course , the inclusion of the son of Will Smith -LRB- who plays one of filmdom 's single most annoying , obnoxious moppets ever -RRB- , is an even worse move ; as is replacing the all-powerful Gort 's death ray with a bizarre contraption that just destroys monuments such as Shea Stadium and the Eiffel Tower , among other landmarks . I did n't know Shea Stadium was a landmark . Anyway ... Another major problem I had was the whole ark sequences , where numerous otherworldly craft land in different locations while animals just seem to throw themselves on board . Oh , all right , let 's face it , I had problems with just about every aspect of this movie , why bore you by listing them all . Then , just when he 's about to wipe out everything , Klaatu hears some Bach and sees Connelly hug her hellish spawn of a son . Does this change anything ? Well , you 'll have to see the film to find out any more than this . Although I do n't recommend paying to see it . Instead , wait for it to come out on DVD , have someone else purchase it and then you can borrow it . Of course , only if every other motion picture ever made in any era by any species on any planet somehow disappears . " ,2
" One of the Worst Remakes of all Time . Hollywood could have made an excellent remake of this 1951 classic . Instead of using State-of-the-Art special effects and staying true to the character development of the original , as well as the moral lessons learned at the end of the film , it tries to instill political correctness where it does n't belong . There was not one character in the movie that made me like them , except maybe Jon Hamm 's character , because I sensed he had deep feelings for Helen Benson . Keanu 's Klaatu had none of the charm of the original , and Jaden Smith 's Jacob Benson was inferior to Billy Gray 's Bobby Benson . It 's too bad , really . It could have been a superior remake , but it fell as flat as a remake could fall . " ,1
" Klaatu : GO HOME , quit bugging us . We have your technology . . The remake was pretty lame . WATCH the original , you will be richly rewarded . I mean back in 1951 we did not have the GORT technology . Guess what dudes . Now we DO . A. Sound discombobulation CHECK . Our military has it now . B. Laser beam . CHECK . We now have that and it destroys stuff . C. Instant Healing compound . CHECK : Yep , we have Silver Sulfadiazine for burn healing . And Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream for healing wounds . -LRB- not as fast as his , but we have them -RRB- D. Floating miasma plasma travel device . SAY WHAT ? That is so bogus . E. Metal chewing bugs . We already had locusts destroy our crops on a mass scale , so this is no show stopper . Been there , done that . So , Klatuu go home and mind your own business . We will take care of ours . This obvious polemic about pollution is so cheesy it is growing mold already . BRAZIL : Idea : What do n't we go to Brazil in a huge fire breathing machine and tell them to stop clearing the rain forest . CHINA : Let 's go to China in the same machine and warn them to not modernize as it will pollute the planet . NOTICE how space ET 's always wind up in Washington , DC , USA . Do n't they study the planet to realize there is India , China , Russia . Geez do your home work already . You ca n't beat Michael Reny , George Carlson , Patricia Neal in the great original directed by Robert Wise . " ,3
" Worst remake ever . How can they even call this a remake there is nothing similar to original other than there are 3 main characters 4 counting robot and even they are not anywhere like the originals especially the bratty kid . OK what else can I say this remake should just have been titled as new movie as there is so little in it that resembles the original classic . I 'd say this was probably why it was a flop and is called one of the worst remakes ever . How am I ever gon na get 10 lines for something that was so bad your review guidelines are so dumb thats probably why you have so few . Other than trashing or raving movie the only thing left to comment on is your stupid minimum of ten lines . Oh my god why does anybody have to go on that long ? " ,1
" Remake on autopilot . I 'm a big fan of the science fiction genre , and 1951 's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is one of the granddaddies of that genre . It 's a thought-provoking movie that still holds up today , so why anybody thought that remaking it as an overblown CGI extravaganza was a good idea is beyond me . Initially , this version is quite interesting , and my expectations were running high as to how filmmakers would adapt the story for modern audiences . Then , at around a third of the running time in , it falls apart , and we 're left with a mix of bland dialogue scenes and soulless CGI set-pieces . It 's hard to know what 's more embarrassing about this production : the cartoonish Gort , who 's never a patch on 1951 's man-in-a-suit , or the lumbering , save-the-planet trite talk . Keanu Reeves is difficult to fault here : after all , he is n't required to do much other than look moody , which he 's good at . However , the rest of the cast are either saddled with dull characters or give poor performances -LRB- and in the case of Jaden Smith , whose mere presence shrieks nepotism , it 's both -RRB- . Jennifer Connelly , decent in recent fare like BLOOD DIAMOND , plays a crushing bore with zero characterisation , while Kathy Bates is an awful caricature . Difficult to believe this is the same actress who played Annie Wilkes . The film becomes increasingly poor as it goes on , and if the fate of mankind really hinges on the presence of a bratty kid and his ` bonding ' with an alien then I despair . There are scenes of destruction that look like something out of the latest Roland Emmerich monstrosity and an alien spaceship that looks like nothing more than an oversize version of the bouncy balls I used to play with as a kid . Remind me why I should care ? " ,3
" A losing remake , much like others recently ... . In trying to make this remake grander and BIGGER , the producers left out the story ! A 7 foot Gort was perfectly fine , why on Earth make him a 60 foot behemoth ? In the 1951 version , Gort did n't have anything to say , but he was imposing and frightening , this one is just big and useless . Michael Rennie 's Klatu was perfectly coherent in the 51 original , but not so with Keanu Reeves ... Klaatu barada nikto gets totally lost in a nothing scene with Keanu uttering the words , not the heroine !!! The original story revolves around a dire warning for Earth people to start getting along or risk annihilation . That message is completely lost in this translation , lost to a poor quality dialog which actually missed all of the most important lines ever placed in any movie . Is there some movie maker rule somewhere that specifies that a remake must completely trash a classic story ? Must be , for this one was trash from the start ... no coherent story at all here ! p.s. I gave this one point more than the loser Starship Troopers simply because there are a couple of lines at the first ten minutes that are good , but have absolutely nothing to do with the classic movie . " ,2
" Just how did will smiths son get this job ? . This would have been a lot better if the story was not stretched to accommodate the no-talent son of will smith . Come on kid wait on some tables before you think your a big shot . The story was twisted to fit this kid and it was ruined as a result . Instead of stealing scenes the kid ruined them . And what happened to Klaktu 's message to earth that was the main point of the original ... bad digression . Bad script . Bad acting except for kathy bates as a secretary Albright type . Good effects though . " ,3
" Pointless and annoying . -LRB- www.plasticpals.com -RRB- A classic sci-fi movie with strong anti-war themes made during the Cold War , updated for our own troubled times . Just replace the threat of all-out nuclear war with climate change , ocean acidification , rainforest deforestation , and other depressing problems looming just around the corner . Throw Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly into the mix and what could possibly go wrong ? A lot , apparently . I 've never seen the original but I 'm familiar enough with it . On paper , it seems like a great opportunity for a remake . But that 's only if made to the high standards of say , Children of Men or Moon -LRB- the last truly intelligent and well executed sci-fi films that come to mind -RRB- . To say this movie falls short of its potential is a huge understatement . Klaatu -LRB- adequately performed by Keanu Reeves -RRB- has arrived on Earth in a hurricane-filled vessel that looks like the ultima spell from Final Fantasy 8 , only cooler . He 's come to save the planet from its irresponsible caretakers -LRB- i.e. mankind -RRB- . He 's brought along his robotic pal GORT , who can only be described as a massive failure of special effects . Have you seen Pepsi Man ? He 's more realistic than GORT . Not only does GORT look super fake , but he does n't liquidate the army 's guns and tanks as in the original ; instead he just emits a high pitched noise which paralyzes the soldiers . Did they run out of money ? That 's not to say GORT is n't cool . His body dissolves into nanomachines that look and behave like locusts on steroids , decimating anything they come into contact with on the molecular level . These sequences are actually really well done . Unfortunately , GORT is criminally underused . TDTESS-001On the run from the US military thanks to the sympathetic Dr.Benson -LRB- Connelly -RRB- , Klaatu hooks up with an old friend from college at a McDonald 's who has been living on Earth for a human lifetime and has come to love and understand humanity . I 'm sorry , but are we honestly supposed to believe that a being of such higher intelligence that it can transplant its mind into another body for fun would spend a lifetime on Earth ? If I could fly around the galaxy in my decked-out tempest sphere , exploring life-sustaining planets , I certainly would n't stop for the backwoods of New Jersey . Then there 's Connelly 's annoying step-son played by Will Smith 's kid , who tags along and generally ruins every scene he is in . Like father like son . He 's supposed to be an annoying brat so I guess I ca n't knock him for being just that . Anyway , suffice to say that by the end of the film we do n't believe in Klaatu 's change of heart towards humanity after witnessing the loving bond between stepmother and stepson . The movie ends so abruptly , and with such an underwhelming cathartic moment , that I was left stunned by its ineptitude . Luckily the movie runs only 1h44mins so if you want to subject yourself to it , it does n't last very long . Probably better to hunt down the original , instead . " ,2
" The day my brain wept ... . This is the worst big-budget Hollywood sci-fi film I 've seen since , well , 20th Century Fox 's last big budget sci-fi film . No surprise there . Amazingly , it has nothing to do with Keanu Reeves . He has his uses -LRB- and they are few -RRB- but he gets off clean here . No , the real culprits here are Scott Derrickson 's complete lack of directing ability and Jaden Smith 's -LRB- son of the Fresh Prince -RRB- atrocious and rage-inducing performance . John Cleese shows up to remind us all why he is awesome and then he 's gone , leaving us with the rest of this suckfest . The humans in this movie do things so insanely stupid that I was rooting for Gort and Klaatu to stomp the ever-loving crap out of these chowderheads and blow Earth to smithereens . Anyone who thinks this is good sci-fi needs a reality check and a visit from my home lobotomy kit . " ,2
" Bloody Awful . What more can I say . This movie was utterly terrible . I loved the original movie . All the classic sci-fi tricks and unique plot . But this movie was a whole different animal . Frankly , I did not go see it in theaters , and I always wanted to see it . Finally , I saw it on TV . I was anticipating another sci-fi drama with this alien warning the people of earth about some sort of disaster befalling us . I kinda saw the whole ecologist thing coming because that is the in thing right now . But , seriously , the plot was all used up years ago . The whole ` we must change before the tipping point is reached in the global warming issue ' is really getting old . It was getting old when The Day After Tomorrow used it . Remakes can go two directions . They can either diverge from the original plot a lot or try too hard to make it a modernized copy of the original that it is awful . These are two reasons that most remakes are awful and this movie is no exception . It falls in the later category . The writers obviously tried too hard to use the original story , but change the cause of our doom . They also used excessive computer effects that made the movie non-believable . Not only was the writing poor , but the acting was horrible . In the original , the alien was stiff and odd , but Reeves took this too far . If I wanted to watch stiff acting and a poorly designed rip-off of another story , I would go to the local high-school play . Frankly , there is no reason that this movie made any money what-so-ever . The plot was poorly designed , the acting was terrible , and writers relied too much on special effects . I really wish that they would make more original movies , because this movie really makes me question whether or not we can remake any . I lost a lot of respect for American cinema today . " ,2
" THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL - -LRB- 2008 -RRB- - Movie Review . THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL -LRB- 2008 -RRB- - passion but no com-passion - - Jack Palance as Jesus Raza from THE PROFESSIONALS -LRB- 1966 -RRB- Directed by Richard Brooks This is sure not your Father 's version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL ! All works of Art can be considered to reflect the times in which they are made . That being said , this version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is indeed a creature of its times . The present movie is couched more within the environmental consciousness of Rachel Carson and Global Warming than the Cold War realities of Uncle Sam Versus the Russkies . It has a faster Spielbergian pace owing to the influence of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and films generated thereafter and a darker tone . Director Scott Derrickson presents us with state-of-the-art CGI Special Effects and a GORT as impressive as anything stepping out of a Marvel Comic Book . The Screenplay focuses more on Klaatu as a man on the run ala THE FUGITIVE and eschews any notion of him needing a tour guide among the natives to point out the sights . Since this is a product of the 21st Century and the Information Age , the Science feels more authentic and you will be hard put to find obvious howlers . You may recall how in the original version Klaatu spoke of having traveled 250 million miles to Earth , which would have put his starting point somewhere inside our Solar System just this side of the Asteroid Belt ! The Music Score is driving and suspenseful , but somehow less memorable than that creepy Theremin in the original version . But this is a matter of personal taste , so you be the judge on that . Keanu Reeves play the title role of Klaatu , but no mild associations with Honest Abe , Sherlock Holmes or even Jesus Christ here . He plays Klaatu with a cold , grim gravitas ; but it lacks the wry humor and gentlemanly civility of Michael Rennie 's interpretation . Whereas warmth and compassion seems woven into the warp and woof of the 1951 version , the characters in this 21st Century remake , like Jennifer Connelly playing Helen Benson , seem to be searching for it or are too involved with the technology or organizational strategy to put such concerns on their ` to do ' list . An Alien landing on a planet where the people themselves are numbly walking through and attempting to extricate themselves from a sense of alienation that they just ca n't shake loose , such as in THE GRADUATE , would have been an interesting theme to explore and develop , but besides an obvious homage to ALPHAVILLE in Klaatu 's escape from the hospital , this theme is barely touched upon . This was a judgment call , I believe , by the Writer and Director that in the end just did n't pay off . Opting to go colder and darker with the tone of the story , Klaatu 's relationship with Bobby as played by Jaden Smith comes across as strained and distant ; even at times conveying undertones of resentment . They are both like two misunderstood children , surly and uncomfortable in each other 's presence . This was meant to increase the dramatic tension with an interesting twist , but the charm of Klaatu as the avuncular guardian and teacher to little Bobby has found its way needlessly to the cutting room floor . There are two scenes that are meant to emphasize Klaatu 's sense of alienation in the midst of these humans . One is at a train station where he doctors a vending machine to get himself a Chicken Salad sandwich and without offering any to the little boy watching him , stands idly by while a man getting his pocket picked has a heart attack or stroke . The other scene is where Bobby brings him to the cemetery to exhume his dead father , having already seen him raise a police officer from the dead . It is at this point that he waxes philosophical about how there are some things he can not do . Thus , in two key scenes where he could have gotten the audience to sympathize with him , he leaves us cold and standing off to the side with Bobby . Right now , I am chuckling mischievously about this . The fact is it would have really been a source of awe and wonder to see Klaatu somehow plausibly bring a Black Man back to life , and would have resurrected some of the family and community feeling that the Writer and Director killed of in the beginning , but then , who am I fooling ? Klaatu might arrive on Earth in a placenta Space Suit made of whale blubber , but bring a person of color back from the grave ? I will let you imagine the possibilities while you ask yourself what universe I am coming from . The thing that stood out about the 1951 version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is that everyone from the leads to the supporting characters to extras appeared to have that gravitas that we only attribute to Morgan Freeman these days . Why is that ? But this is the 21st Century , Jack , and who am I to take umbrage at a film that grossed over 300 million worldwide ? Good Times For All , Eligah " ,4
" The Day the Earth Is Better off without this film . My Holy God why did you allow the powers that be to spend multi millions on this film ? Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role that requires no emotion but people I have to say that this is a film where one spends the entire time waiting for something to happen but it never does . It is like a mixture between Star Trek Nemesis and 2001 A space Odyssey . the boredom is palpable throughout and only a great performance from Ms. Connelly saves the whole thing . I recommend this film to everyone . Why ? Because I think your morbid curiosity should be satiated like mine ... And ultimately be disappointed ... Ant . 2010 , Dec 11 . " ,1
" The day Hollywood stops rewriting remakes -LRB- DVD -RRB- . When this day comes , it would be great . Up then , we will find craps like this movie . For me , a remake -LRB- or an adaptation -RRB- is xerox , just copy and paste : you do n't have to add anything . If you change the original story and keep only the basic idea , well you are a thief and a lazy artist without any talent ! I never see the original movie by Wise but it 's a classic : flying saucers land in bright day , then a cyclopean alien robot gets out but humans have only guns and violence for welcome . -LRB- Beyond , Wise left a tasteful cinematography because he keeps popping out lately : this movie , Star Trek and the Haunting reviewed by the King himself in his Danse Macabre . As would have said another master , PKD , Science-fiction is n't about feelings but rather with ideas , thus a good storyteller can only be attracted by this thematic -RRB- . Here , the production went silly : First , they wanted to redesign Gork . They draw hideous sketches -LRB- see the bonus -RRB- until one day , a guy said simply that Gork was a faceless human , thus back to the original design . Then , they had to transform him in nanorobots -LRB- that look like as our well-know insects -RRB- : stupid ! They seem to eat the human creations but left New York untouched ! Gone too the saucer -LRB- it 's too tied to the 50 's -RRB- , replaced by bubbles that arrive at night ! What 's a chilling moment and i wonder if they have heard about X-Files . The only thing they got nearly right was the cast : it 's always great to see Keanu , Jenni and Sir Cleese . The son of Will Smith is fine but he has n't the smile of his father and the writer wrecked his part , being unable to write decent lines with his stepmother ! In conclusion , throw it away and keep up with the original ! " ,4
" Could be better . I have n't seen the original 1950 's movie to make any comparisons but I would n't actually call the new one bad , just not great . The first half was well done , it had quick action , good visuals and it held me at the edge of my seat . The second half was slower and the final scene underwhelming . Keanu Reeves was very good in this part tailor made for him , Jennifer Connelly less so and Jaden Smith was given a character so obnoxious and pointless that it would be better left out . And what about the aliens ' main plan ? They love the planet so much that in order to save it from humanity they want to destroy all living creatures , save for a few that are carried away in a number of small arc spheres . Those few spared would struggle to repopulate the scorched earth . If you are doing more damage than good to the Earth , why bother ? The basic concept is there : Habitable planets like Earth are rare in the universe and therefore precious . Humans are indeed self-destructive and need to change . Yet a few improvements in the script would help raise the movie to another level " ,3
" A Letdown ... . Back in 1951 , a film with the same name was a immensely popular with people ... 57 years later a lose remake is made . Expectations are massive , eye-catching promotion , Keanu Reeves in the central role etc. . Sadly ` The Day The Earth Stood Still ' does n't live up-to its mark . When I rent a DVD ... I not only bring it home with expectations , but even with a lot of excitement of how well will it entertain me . ` The Day The Earth Stood Still ' is a poor show all the way ... nothing works in here . The film lacks the flavor . Filmmaker Scott Derrickson in henpecked by a poor script . The film starts on a dull graph and remains as such . In the acting department : Keanu Reeves delivers a sincere performance , playing the character with honesty . Jennifer Connelly is alright . Jaden Smith , as the irritating kid is perfect . John Cleese is wasted . Kathy Bates is as usual . on the whole ` The Day The Earth Stood Still ' is more of a experiment than a entertainer . " ,3
" Original 100 Xs Better . I can not believe that this film was even made . Scott Derrickson is obviously a rookie . Considering the good job he did with Emily Rose , I found it hard to believe the way he went with this movie . And not surprising was Keanu Reeves who has played the same character in Speed , The Matrix -LRB- s -RRB- , and this film . What do we call it ? Oh yeah ... monotone ! I actually did n't find any excitement in the script , the cgi , the acting , or even the opening or closing credits . Overall this movie should be given out on blu ray for free along with a coupon for free popcorn and soda . This wo n't make up for the time lost seeing this pile of nonsense , but hopefully the theaters will start getting the hint soon that with 3d TV , blu ray , on demand , and netflix on most new TVs , soon they will be out of business .

" Empty Remake Void of Original 's Heart and Mind and Acting Skill . I love the Robert Wise original for an array of reasons : the story is just so engaging , it has an allegorical , underlying subtext , its cheapish yet lovable special effects , Michael Rennie and Billy Gray and Patricia Neal and so on , the line Klaatu Beratta Nickto -LRB- or however it is spelled -RRB- , and its various peripheral messages such as how the media makes more tragedy and creates panic through manipulation of their trade - a major problem looming now and assuredly one that will grow and grow and grow . Certainly a remake would make drastic changes . The Red Scare was prevalent in the time of that first film - so it played a large part in it . But this remake makes a lot of huge , unnecessary changes with the characters and the story and really the original purpose . The original film showed that an alien wanted to offer mankind an opportunity to change . This film really does not - or not tome in a convincing manner . Keanu Reeves is no Michael Rennie . He is rather bland in this though does perform better than what I expected . He is not curious at all about mankind . He shuffles through one scene after another . Gone are the poignant scenes with him and the child - though an attempt is made at a cemetery . That brings me to a big problem for me ; Jaden Smith . You know the actor-son of Will Smith . I think the young man has some talent , but he is miscast in this film . I did n't care about him at all nor his relationship with his mother or Reeves . He was more annoying than anything . Jennifer Connely is n't much better . But let 's be fair - the script is muddled trying to infuse an old idea with new ones and ending up creating a mess . This film could have done so much more with it if it had had a good script treatment and find some character acting with depth . Only John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt gives a likable performance . Kathy Bates plays an important role but her actions are not very logical . Yes , there are a load of special effects like little metal bugs that eat their way through everything and huge spherical orbs that begin to take the species on earth like a Noah 's Ark. . All this was masking tape to cover up the threadbare grip the script had on telling or in this case retelling a great story . What a pity that producers today must constantly go back and borrow the ideas of the past because they lack new , creative ones , but they nonetheless feel compelled to bastardize those original ideas so much as to alienate the people that would have been loyal to the original and its ideas and rather play down to a new audience with whom they have so little regard . " ,4
" Same old idiot humans . Maybe I 'm the one who 's the idiot , hoping that EVENTUALLY someone is going to make a serious SciFi flick where the humans do n't come off as terrified , aggressive cavemen . It 's really very simple : shoot the alien representative - and his people come and sterilize our planet in disgust . Act like Kathy Bates does in this movie , and the alien just says , Sorry , but your actions have doomed your species to extinction . If I knew how to make short movies , I 'd have the humans take to visitor directly to the dissection lab - where they open it up and find it 's just an empty shell with a note saying , Oops , you lose ! And then the Earth blows up . There are plenty of sci fi stories out there , some of them incredibly good , in which the humans welcome the alien -LRB- s -RRB- cordially , and ask , What can we do for you ? instead of trying to blow them away in knee-jerk fashion . -LRB- SPOILER -RRB- Even though this movie recycles the names Klaatu and Gort , and the scene with the scientist 's blackboard , otherwise this really is n't a remake at all . There is n't even a scene in which the Earth Stands Still . And there 's never any explanation of the purpose of the implant in the original mountaineer 's hand . Of course , maybe it 's just a disregard this moron warning , for someone who goes out in a blizzard in the Karakorums without putting up his parka 's hood or sealing his neckline . He 'd be frozen to death within the first half-mile . " ,3
" I thought . I felt the film was okay , until the horrible last 20 minutes , my summery of the last twenty minutes are ...

" Independence Day meets Starman meets bad acting meets ... . ... what a horrid movie ! OK , not horrid ... but lame . Its one of those movies , that you keep waiting for it to get better -LRB- and never does -RRB- . The producer -LRB- s -RRB- should be banned from ever making another movie ! All they did was rip off a TON of bits from past movies and crumble them into this one . Lets count : 1 . Independence Day -LRB- mothership plus many smaller ones poised to destroy earth . . or Earth -RRB- , 2 . Starman -LRB- alien learns humankind 's mannerisms via female citizen -RRB- , 3 . Iron Man -LRB- GORT -RRB- , 4 . 2001 : A Space Oddessy -LRB- the high pitched sound to drop a human -RRB- , The Mummy -LRB- swarm of insects on a rampage -RRB- , 5 . Independence Day - AGAIN ! -LRB- alien dissected to reveal a body inside a pseudo-organic outer shell -RRB- , ... it just goes on an on . The acting was horrible -LRB- Bates is a statue -RRB- . The plausibility of the story is hideous -LRB- wow ... aliens speak our language and mimic our mannerisms . . and wear 3 piece suits ? -RRB- . I guess . Pros : Uhhhh ... hmmmm ... I dunno Cons : See above . " ,2
" The Day the Earth Stood Still . From director Scott Derrickson -LRB- The Exorcism of Emily Rose -RRB- , I knew a remake of a classic film could be a mistake , I just wanted to see how much of a mistake . Many scientists , including Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- are brought to see something come to Earth , and giant shiny alien sphere -LRB- instead of a flying saucer -RRB- lands in Central Park in Manhattan . This alien turns into a human named Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- , and he is adamant to see all the world 's leaders to give them a warning , but Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson -LRB- Kathy Bates -RRB- is n't going to let him go . He manages to escape , and Helen wants to help him in his mission to save Earth , ultimately it is the human race destroying Earth themselves , and the sphere may release something to destroy everything causing destruction . Meanwhile , scientists are trying to find out more about the giant robot Klaatu landed with , which they name GORT -LRB- Genetically Organized Robotic Technology -RRB- . In the end , Klaatu ca n't face all human being killed , and he may be the only thing that can stop the destructive gust of microscopic alien insects , and Helen convinces him the human race could change their ways . Also starring Jaden Smith -LRB- Will 's son -RRB- as Jacob Benson , John Cleese as Professor Barnhardt , Jon Hamm as Michael Granier , J.C. MacKenzie as Grossman , Mousa Kraish as Yusef , Hiro Kanagawa as Dr. Ikegawa and Sunita Prasad as Rouhani . The special effects are pretty good , but the story with some added material , a changed format , Keanu Reeves being moody and not friendly like Michael Rennie , and of course , missing the catchphrase Klaatu Barada Nikto ! , this is nowhere near as good as the original . It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Prequel , Remake , Rip-Off or Sequel . Okay ! " ,4
" The Day I Cried Myself Home -LRB- TDICMH -RRB- . Wow . That is all I can say is wow . This has got to be THE WORST remake of a timeless classic I have ever seen . I Have n't had much time to do this comment , as I have been meaning to for quite some time . I really pity Keanu Reeves , I really like him as and actor , but he came nowhere near Klaatu . I sorry its true . As you can already tell I have seen the original and loved it . Keanu came nowhere near Klaatu in the movie in the original he is suppost to be a good and nice guy , not some whack-job that is trying to destroy the earth . Second of all where did the Klaatu Barada Nicto come into play . Not ONCE did I hear it , that was one of the originals best line . Thirdly why did the army name it GORT . In the original GORT was already named GORT . Also in the original the kid was suppost to like Klaatu not hate him . I do feel bad for Jaden smith , GREAT actor in The Pursuit of Happiness , yes thats the way its spelled . Again what was the whole thing with the beginning , did that even serve as a purpose the the storyline ??????? I was really mad that this remake was a horrible movie . I recently bought the movie and before you go off telling people I am a hypocrite I ONLY bought it because it came with the original copy . This was an utter disaster , to me pretty much an insult to the original but thats just my opinion , see it for yourself and see what you think . " ,3
" Time to turn off the life support machine , grandpa . It seems all the old people who grew up with the 1951 version of this film have hobbled their way over to their computers in between knitting sweaters and cursing every other generation that lived to give this movie a bad rating simply because its a remake . I find it quite insulting . I 'm starting to see a pattern that follows every film remake . I thought it was pretty good . Perhaps not the greatest movie in the world , but 5\/10 ? No . If your going to judge a movie purely on your fan boy opinion of an earlier version then do n't bother giving it a rating on a website that 's for everybody . If you ca n't control yourself to do that then the internet is n't for you . Newspapers are still being printed for your comfort and convenience . " ,8
" When The Military fails to achieve an objective with the Sword , they ask for more swords . In 1951 Robert Wise made a film called The Day The Earth Stood Still . Over the years , a majority of fans have agreed , for it 's time was quite remarkable . In 2008 a remake arrived and this is the result . In comparing the two , there is little similarity . In the original Black and White version audiences were immediately snared and captivated with an eerie and haunting theme which signaled impending doom , The newer version has neither a haunting theme , nor the ominous feel of one . The 1951 movie had an impressive atomic power Spaceship , here audiences are treated to a gigantic mother Orb and thousands of smaller copies , imitating the crafts of Independence Day . When the spaceship landed in 51 ' Michael Rennie offered ` Peace and Good Will ' the military replied with gunfire . In 1951 , America was infected with an epidemic virus of Fear and suspicion . In 2008 , little has changed , except perhaps the virus now included the feminine strain of Suspicion and Fear , but the military still responds with gunfire . In the 1950 's when Klattu is wounded , his incredible robot named Gort , easily disarms the feeble army . Here despite all the advances in military weaponry , they are still unable to match Gort . nevertheless , the space visitor takes to the streets in able to learn . In 2008 , Humans have evolved little , except to realize they are responsible for the deleterious condition of the Earth . Our Representative Thinker in 1951 was noted actor Sam Jeffe , in the new movie , it 's John Cleese , who is Prof. Barnhardt . With Patricia Neal helping Klattu in the 50 ' audiences expected similar in 08 ' . However adapting to the times , Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- is met by Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- who is now a PHD . In addition , Mr. Harley , Personal Sect . to the president is replaced by Kathy Bates , Sec . Def Regina Jackson . Both are equally inept at understanding the visitor . In the final analyst between the two versions , the original conveyed the message , eliminate your ignorance and aggression or face obliteration , in the new film , the director has eliminated the first segment and opts for obliteration . Take your choice , watch the Original and be impressed or view the second and be disappointed . \*\*\*\* " ,7
" some interesting ideas , but ultimately it sucked . i watched this movie based on all the negative feedback i heart about it . it started off interesting - it 's got this \* SPOILER - huge guardian cyborg protecting keanu , that later in the movie comes apart into millions upon millions of microscopic robotic locust like creatures that consumes every material object they come into contact with . But it turned dull real quick . there was n't enough character development , or coverage of the aliens or their origions . keanu is like this really dull boring starman for the 21st century . this movie would have been better suited as a straight to video release -LRB- With not so many special FX CGI jazz -RRB- ... which you could find repeated regularly on some crappy cable channel like zone sc-fi or horror or something . I 'm sure even a b-movie actor on a salary of $ 150k could deliver a more interesting performance than Neo -LRB- aka Keanu Reeves -RRB- the movie ended really abruptly also . keanu reeves redeems his role as the savior of the human race , ` Neo ' , in almost every movie he does -LRB- is kinda funny -RRB- . keanu 's acting is on a similar level to schwatzenegger 's all he has to do is turn up , be himself and at the most , act icy cold . so yeah on the whole this movie sucked . i give it 4\/10 for some of the creature designs and ideas . not worth watching though , it 'll just leave you feeling depressed at the end of it -LRB- not because it 's a beautiful sad melancholy piece of work , but because of how badly written the thing is , and also for Keanu reprising his role as Neo for like the 9th time now . " ,4
" Was n't that bad ... . I had n't seen the original so the plot was kinda ` fresh ' for me . The starting minutes really gets you into the feel of the movie . The welcome of klaatu in an extreme humanly fashion , and klaatu 's reaction to it seems justified to the plot . The character of klaatu as played by Keanu is of a being having no particular love for the human race . He 's concerned with the life sustainability of the earth for which he 's prepared to wipe out the entire human race . Now the way klaatu changes his mind seems a bit insufficient for that intelligent a being , but its not entirely unbelievable either . Overall the movie was above average , but being a fan of movies in this genre i would 've liked it anyway . " ,8
" I liked it , but it 's not great . The shadow of the 1951 film darkens all the reviews here . I have n't seen the original movie , but I did see the last scene of it , where the alien tells humans that `` they have a system and it works '' and that a race of robots was created to attack any and all aggressors , therefore there is no more aggression in the universe . That seems so silly now , especially in this political climate . As for the new one , Keanu does his job . I liked that his presence , in person and script , is so immense that humans feel like tiny insects . I have been longing for a movie like this , since it is obvious that no amount of human spirit would be a match for the technology -LRB- and experience -RRB- of a space faring species . The reasons why the alien comes and leaves are ridiculous , though . One can only update a concept so much before changing the entire thing . And one can only tell so much without spoiling the movie . Also , the different acts of the script seems too disconnected to be part of the same movie . Bottom line : the movie seems a bit slow in pace , but if you look back , you realize that there is n't much they could have left out . The little psychopathic black kid as a representative of the human race almost made me want GORT to destroy humanity . I wish the script would have been more consistent . All in all , average . " ,7
" . . I think i expected too much ! . A remake of the 1951 classic sci-fi film which never should have been made at first place about an alien visitor and his giant robot counterpart who visit Earth . The movie left out with a lot of questions in the end . No doubt the special effects are good enough but that ca n't fill the blocked plot of the movie . As a whole if you really want to go see this film do not expect anything out of it than you might not disappoint at the end . Performance wise it was okay . jennifer connely looked awesome in the movie . Still wondering what happened at the end of the movie ? Was there any message for us ? Did aliens find us okay the way we are . Finally because i did n't expect anything i would give it 4 out of 10 other than that this movie should not deserve more than 4 that too i have become lenient keeping the star cast of the movie in mind .

" Nothing Special . The Day the Earth Stood Still - \*\* Director : Scott Derrickson Certificate : 12A Duration : 103 mins Starring : Keanu Reeves , Jennifer Connelly , Kathy Bates , Jaden Smith and John Cleese I was looking forward to this . I ca n't say if am against this remake as I 've never seen the original . The trailers looked interesting , kind of like the Cloverfield trailers where you do n't know what 's happening so you want to go see it just to find out what on earth is going on . That 's the reason I wanted to see The Day the Earth Stood Still , but I did n't get what I was hoping for . I enjoyed the first 30 minutes of this film , where strange spherical things had been appearing all over the world and no one had any idea what to do , so they go and find the best scientists in the world , one of which was Jennifer Connelly . Then she 's taken to the big sphere in central park , where everything seems to happen , where she \* meets \* Klaatu , played by Keanu Reaves , who knows slightly too much . So he 's taken back to some sort of army base and is examined by Kathy Bates and co. and if I say anymore the 30 minutes end and all the answer come spick and span . But basically the earth is threatened by other beings knowing that we are doing no good for the world instead of I think nuclear issues in the original . The acting though was pretty good , Keanu Reaves does n't really have an incredible acting role in this film , as for most of it he just stands and speaks with just one expression on his face , kind of like a concentrated anger . Connelly was good all they way through she never stood out in anyway but by no means bad . Jaden Smith was alright but I could n't help but dislike his character , I found him annoying . I loved seeing John Cleese in this film ; he brings subtle comedy into this quite serious film . The CGI was not amazing there 's been better . Everything that was CGI looked like it was CGI . Also Gort I think his name is , the big metal man , he looks way to fake for a film like this . My main issue of this film is that the answers and conclusions come way too quickly and easily with most of the time Klaatu bringing up his new superpowers and saving the day . So I think this film needed more panicking and more of people not knowing what the hells going on . " ,4
" Disappointing , heavily lets the original down . . Being Australian , I get a little tired of seeing the U.S. -LRB- especially New York or Washington , D.C. -RRB- as the center of things , and the only place where anything of significance happens . The behavior of the Administration and the military is predictable and very two-dimensional . Everything that is not understood has to be agressively attacked . God help the human race if we really are represented by these hollow people . The script is almost non-existent and the plot , as it is , difficult to follow . I did like the 21st century update of Klaatu 's reasons for coming to Earth , and it is a nice touch , given the precarious times we live in , but I thought The means of delivery were ridiculous and hastily dreamt-up . The close-up shots of the devices were unnecessary , and for me , counter-productive . Main stars were very good , especially Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly . The inclusion of her character 's stepson , unfortunately was a major annoyance , and on more than one occasion in the cinema , I wanted to yell out at him to shut up , or words to that effect . On the whole , there have been been better remakes -LRB- I think War of the Worlds was better done -RRB- and much better movies this year . A very good opportunity not fully made the most of . " ,7
" Klaatu barada nikto \/ otkin adarab utaalk . I remember reading somewhere that `` Klaatu barada nikto '' meant `` Harm them not , for they know not what they do . '' I 'm not sure it 's true , but I like that meaning , and find it appropriate - because this film takes the polar opposite view . In this film it is more a case of , `` They know exactly what they 're doing , but are sticking their fingers in their ears and humming rather than admitting it or trying to fix it - so kill them all . '' In this film humans are n't excused for being children , they 're put on trial , as adults . That we 're destabilising global temperatures is n't the problem . That we 're doing nothing about it is n't the problem . It 's the fact that it was proved for about ten years and that the majority chose to not believe it in spite of all evidence until about two years ago . And quite frankly , good . Idiots who deliberately chose to reality -LRB- such as ignore major problems on the horizon - like global warming -RRB- and encourage others to do so , are just a big a threat to our world as nuclear weapons were when the first film was made . That is a good idea , an IMPORTANT idea . It 's just a pity the producers were too cowardly to follow through on it . So why could n't they say this ? It 's a classic case of telling rather than showing . Giving humans cheap clean fusion -LRB- for example -RRB- might help fix the environment , but it wo n't fix the insane delusions that too many humans are dumb enough to believe . For example , the insane delusion that the world is 6000 years old . Or the insane delusion that some people still have that global warming is n't real . Nothing the aliens can do or say or give away can fix that . So why could n't Klaatu say this ? Another horrid example -LRB- amongst many -RRB- of this ` tell do n't show ' is when Klaatu 's ship approaches Earth . His ships is moving as 3 times 10 to the power of 7 meters per second you say ? 1\/10th the speed of light you say ? That might damage New York you say ? NO you IDIOT . That 's wo n't slightly damage Manhattan , that will make Earth look like an apple after a horse has bitten it in half . So why could n't the scientists say this ? And I 'm afraid that question sums up my review of this film . Why could n't they have done it properly ? " ,1
" Greenpeace do this movie . Well , with the actors you know go to be a ad movie , with the trailer , you the whole movie . Keanu Reeves is a martian because is a awful actor ... but Jenifer Connely is not bad , but she works in bad movies , but Dark City is awesome , and the others actors suck-ass . One of worst scenes in the movie is when they go to Mc ` donalds , and appear the Chinese martian ... COME ON ! this movie is a joke , and in the end , is obviusly what go to say Keanu Reeves , i do n't remember well , but was how the humans can change or have especials habylities , i do n't remember well , but after he say that , me a my sister say : `` Greenpeace do this movie '' The only good is the giant robot . There 's is not destruction in this movie : IS AWFUL PD : Somebody else hate the stepson of Connelly ? " ,1
" What a movie ... what a disappointment . Well I just got back from seeing the movie . There is one thing that I have to say that the lead role , Keanu Reeves , nailed the part just right . There are reviews out their in the land of the internet that say that his portrait of Klatu was wooden . Which I have to say that it is true . But when you see the whole movie you will come to understand that as an alien that used a human DNA to mix in with the race in order to make a final judgment on the Earth the you will understand why Keanu Reeves made the portrait Klatu as he did . A person that is devoid of emotion and has to get used to the human body as it is apparent early on in the movie . Many movie goers now in there days want the movie to do the thinking for them and not think for themselves . Was this movie preachy ? Yes , it was . Was the movie good ? Well if you like `` hard '' Sci-fi then this is the movie for you where you have to think your way through then ... Same reason why this same The Day that the Earth stood still was shown for the first did not do well , because it was preachy and all . This version is more near to the book than the original that was made squeaky clean for the audience of the 50 's . For what ever is worth ... klaatu barada nikto was ... shall we say omitted . I was looking for the classic line , but did not hear it uttered once . I may have missed it , but I did not hear it . Enjoy . " ,7
" The day the earth said `` You know the drill , just keep bombing '' . This could have and should have been the most significant movie in the 21st century but instead fox does what it always does and focuses so much on updating the story so that the alien meets the demands of being the all powerful kickass machine that they loose all depth and meaning in the plot . Here 's a list of things which i found wrong with this film 1 . During the graveyard scene where Klaatu suddenly realizes the goodness in the hearts of some humans you see the little locust things floating over the trees , if they are spreading everywhere then how come the bugs did n't devour them then and there . 2 . The horrid replies to certain statements like `` The highway 's completely empty '' , `` They shut it down '' , `` They shut it down ... for what '' , `` For us ! '' , wow , you 'd think a female scientist taking for a ride by the government would have some common sense , and then there 's `` It 's leaving '' , `` No ... he 's leaving '' Awwwwww ... ai n't Jaden Smith so cute when he spouts bad dialogue . 3 . They stereotyped the crap out of this movie so that the scientists want to help the alien and the government only wishes to blow it up . 4 . They never explained what John Cleese was doing on the blackboard . 5 . James Hong came to the planet 50 years before Klaatu , sssooo ... how come nobody noticed . 6 . I guess Jaden Smith did n't have big will around to show him how to act . 7 . The ending is an utter atrocity , Klaatu makes all forms of machinery and weaponry useless on the face of the earth so that we are sent back into the 1800 's where we had to use candles and wooden ships , then it just ends , so , what 's the worlds reaction to this , does he really think it made the world better , i think film history has shown us that the one and only reaction to a power outage is criminals bombarding every shop window in sight .

" The Day The Earth Went Nowhere . If you are a long time SF fan as I am , you will feel let down by this movie . As others have stated it 's not bad -- it just does not quite get there . All they had to do was to keep to the same simple story and update the special effects . In the original the religious references were very subtle -- not so in this version . Advanced technology can appear to be mystical while still being scientific and not supernatural -- this film goes too far in the supernatural direction . They do explain how Klaatu appears to be human -LRB- which was never done in the original -RRB- so at least they did some things right . The famous blackboard scene is included , but SF fans will be let down by elimination of the `` Klaatu borada nikto '' line and Klaatu 's final speech . " ,4
" Why ? . I suppose there have been a few decent remakes of classic films . This is not one of them . Making this film was a really bad idea . And as bad as the idea was the execution of that idea is even worse . This movie fails on so many levels . Where to begin ? With the butchering of the original film 's message ? With the terrible acting ? The horrible dialogue ? The ludicrously overdone special effects ? The nonsensical ending ? Any direction you choose to go in gives you plenty to criticize . What a mess this is . The story is the most important thing in any film so best to start there . The original film was about the dangers of war . This film is about what ? The need to recycle our plastics ? Lame . And there are plenty of other aspects of the story which make no sense whatsoever if you actually think about it . Of course thinking about this film 's story really is a waste of precious brain cells . The story fails , the movie fails . Pretty simple really . But just in case the lousy story is n't enough this film piles on layer upon layer of failure . The best thing that can be said about the acting is that at least Keanu Reeves knows how to play wooden and emotionless . His performance as Klaatu actually kind of works . But Jennifer Connelly ? Keep this up and the Academy 's going to ask for their Oscar back . Kathy Bates as the Secretary of Defense ? No . Just no . And Jaden Smith , step right up and take your place at the head of the list of most annoying child performances ever . Must be nice to have a father who can get you jobs like this even if you have no discernible acting ability . Perhaps the only thing more annoying than watching the actors speak the film 's cringe-inducing dialogue is watching the overblown special effects . The original film had no budget for effects and had to focus on story . This film had a massive budget and the end result is predictable . It 's a special effects orgy with no story to ground the film . All the effects are over the top but above all else what in the world have they done with poor Gort ? Give me back my 1951 guy in a foam rubber suit please . What they 've done with Gort is truly laughable . Finally , and not a moment too soon if you actually have to sit through this drivel , we come to the film 's ending . If you wanted to be polite you could say that the film 's conclusion is not particularly well thought out . If you were unconcerned with being polite you could say it 's the perfectly stupid finish to a perfectly stupid movie . " ,3
" End of the world sort of movie , in this remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still ! . Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- is asked to come with federal agents for some kind of national emergency along with other people who are experts in their field having to do with science . They are all shown a slide show of an object that has set course for Manhattan which is a city of 8 million inhabitants which will end its destination in 78 minutes time . In something of an end of the world film , but in this film it 's more like an alien invasion like from the film War of the Worlds . Although this movie stars Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly , what really makes this movie exciting are the special effects and graphics bringing you into the film and making you feel the old films from this remake from 1951 classic sci-fi film which probably does n't compare to this movie to some people , but might be fun to check out anyways . When it comes to the end of the world you look deeper into things , it shows you how the character sort of runs from the disaster or how they figure out what is going on . In this film Connelly 's character Benson is the head honcho as some people would call it to stop the aliens from destroying everything and starting anew . I 'm not really sure what it is when I watch sci-fi , but it intrigues you so much probably because it is less predictable than a movie based off something that is realistic . " ,7
" This Day the Earth Stood Still is a pointless remake and it has some eye-rolling moments and a terrible conclusion , but if perceived as a B-movie , it might be enjoyable . Some classics are so revolutionary and impeccable as they are that there really is no need to try to remake them . However , the 1951 masterpiece The Day the Earth Stood Still was not one of them . That picture , though very strong , could be effectively made again in the 21st century , even though a remake is really unnecessary . The heavily panned 2008 remake somewhat deserves the negative reputation it has . Yes , it is a pointless remake that emphasizes too much on the visual effects and not enough on the story . No , it 's not even half the movie the original was . Yes , the original is ten times better and always will be . No , this is not a great remake . Nevertheless , I enjoyed the movie on the level that I saw it . I did not sit down to watch a revolutionary remake . Perhaps the negative publicity had caused me to lower my standards enough . I saw the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still really as a hokey B-movie retread of a classic story and on that level , I had fun with it . Even though I did marginally like the movie , most of my review will focus on criticisms because again , I only enjoyed the movie as a camp-fest and not the visionary gem the original was . A heavy point of criticism focuses on the one-note performance of Keanu Reeves . Here he portrays the same character that Michael Rennie made famous in the 1951 original . Reeves maintains a slow , grim speed and glower throughout the entirety of the picture . Frankly , he reminded me more of a Terminator than an alien . And the charm that made the Rennie 's Klaatu so memorable is gone . But this is really the fault of the screenwriters who gave Reeves very little to work on . Overall , I thought Keanu Reeves did as good a job as he as actor could have done with the material he was handed . I like Jennifer Connelly and her performance is noble enough , but she does n't have much to do . And Jaden Smith is also good in the movie , but the character he has to play is a little ostentatiously bratty and noisy and thus , I really did n't come to care about his fate . These are the three main characters and everybody else has no personality whatsoever . They just come and go here and there . Now as for the special effects ? They are also part of the reason why I saw this Day the Earth Stood Still as a B-movie . The special effects are not very impressive , particularly when referring to the robot giant Gort , who was impressive in the original , but just phony here . Ultimately , the reason why this remake does not work in the same way that the original did is because it has it down in its mind that just because you can update the special effects that you will strike with the same results and that 's balderdash . Take Peter Jackson 's remake of King Kong . Jackson most certainly updated the effects , but his remake worked because he also updated the story . In the end , I liked the movie , but only when I perceived it as a campy B-movie instead of the A-class remake that a lot of fans of the original were hoping for . Had I seen it without reading the reviews before , I do n't think I would have enjoyed it . But lowering my standards for a hundred minutes and just taking what came , despite a few eye-rolling moments , some banal product placement , and a horrendously bad ending , I did enjoy this remake . Nevertheless , my advice is to still with the original . That 's a better film for any time of the day . This is just a funny way to pass time when there 's little else to do . It could have been much , much better , but it might have been a lot worse as well . " ,7
" Focus on the message . . I have one major problem with this film and one minor problem . My major problem is Jared Smith . His character is without doubt the most arrogant , supercilious , narcissistic , obnoxious and overbearing child character I have ever seen in any media . The bit of it is the acting he did was to be less of a conceited little worm than he probably is in real life . My minor problem was the corny reference to the Noah 's Ark myth . In my mind the only thing more ludicrous than that story is the fact that some people actually believe it , would kill or die over it and hold deep hostility , hatred and prejudice against those who do not believe it . This a minor problem because , after all , unwillingness or inability to change and accept reality is the central thesis of the film . There are those who are swift to criticize Keanu Reeves ' performance as Klaatu because his character , to some , lacks emotion and depth . The simple fact is that Klaatu is something other than human inside a human body . For him to be like a spiffy trial lawyer with a 100 % kill ratio simply does not fit the role . He has logic , purpose , power and zeal . He learns that change can and should occur in himself . I ca n't imagine anyone better suited for the part . Others believe that Jennifer Connelly 's character is disjointed and detached from the rest of the world . This may be true , but her character IS different . She sees Klaatu as more of a solution than a problem . She connects with him , defends him , believes in him and is the first to recognize that he is a force with reason , not just an agenda . She balances her fears with conviction and is the perfect protagonist . Kathy Bates always pleases . At first she is the officious duty oriented subordinate to a typical U.S. president who clamors for exclusive control for something that is beyond control . She takes hostile action under the false belief that force and violence is the only way to confront something that is virtually impervious in terms of preemptive military intervention . She later softens but regretfully follows the directives of her leader . Her character arc , while subtle , is valid and believable . While short , the role of the professor played by John Cleese is pivotal in the sense that his remark about change at the precipice of destruction has impact on Klaatu as he toils with a decision that can only be made by him . Yes , there were flaws . And yes , there were glitches . Nevertheless these are well compensated by the inherent message and by the question what happens now ? The answer to that question is a controversy , but controversy sells and if it were n't for Jared Smith I 'd give this one a 9 without doubt . " ,8

With the industry technology where it is today and the subject matter this movie is based on -LRB- man destroying his own planet with no regard for other species -RRB- I was expecting a powerful and impact full and visually entertaining experience.Well that 's what I get for thinking . This movie is so limp it was embarrassing to watch . Not one of the actors convinced me of anything . I could care less about their presence on the screen . I was thinking that maybe they had already left the planet . What happened to the special affects ? When I think about the screening process that the people involved did and when they were asking themselves if this was something that a large enough group of people would want to see and they said yes I moan when I realize what they think of movie goers " ,4
" More ridiculous that ridiculous . Yet another reprise of a classic film . And once again a disaster . If Hollywood on is immensely rich in dollars , it was billions , we are not in imagination . Why make intelligent movies when 99.9999999 % of people love what is produced . Just look at the `` fabulous '' Oscar to realize that everything is a matter of big stars . The `` Names '' that 's all for a film . Whether actors , directors , producers , music composers , etc. . If you have a name in Hollywood you can do anything . And all the people are happy . This is not the Earth that should stop -LRB- turning -RRB- , but the shooting of this film . It 's really ridiculous . Examples : The mother with an alien , and drags her child wherever she goes . The alien has come to destroy the Earth . It is supposed to know the human species . But in the film we see that he knew nothing . Yet it took thousands of years for that . Too bad that 50 years the writers and all the people of Hollywood have not changed at all . If this is in the financial field . I give this film a 2 \/ 10 . Because what the film cost , we could have made a good story . But unfortunately , Hollywood is controlled by the group of people . A very small group . And have a very small brain -LRB- no imagination but a lot of money -RRB- . The human species is the worst animal species . And it has nothing to do with it . It will continue to destroy everything . And the greedy , millionaires and billionaires , to want controlled and acquire other resources . " ,2
" go see independence day again instead . ah , the tried and tested formula for a blockbuster of aliens invading earth and we do n't know if they are friend or foe etc. . Its unfair to compare this to the original made almost 60 years ago as in special effects alone , movies are completely different nowadays . I prefer to compare this to something contemporary like Independence day which was all the things this movie was not , slick , intelligent , though-provoking , funny and a solid script . One thing the producers did get right was to cast Mr.Wooden himself keanu reeves as the alien , and john cleese has a good cameo as a nobel prize winner but there is precious little else to recommend here . The script is illogical and has too many lot holes to mention , the concept of us not looking after the planet and the fact that its not ours and may belong to other celestial beings should have been explored in much greater detail , instead we hear a lot of whining from will smith 's son who does not act half as well as when he 's with one of his -LRB- real -RRB- parents . And the idea that only aliens come to the US and its always places like manhattan gets tiresome , as is the humans get violent first and think later and shoot themselves in the foot and where 's the so-called leader of the first world in this the president and what about other world leaders , sorry i have to stop now , as you can see , its an annoying , expensive waste of time and money " ,3
" What a waste of time , . I had hoped this might be a good movie but it is not . So many unrelated and meaningless story lines . The only redeeming factor was that it ended . But far longer than it should . Do n't spend a cent on this ... It is just not worth watching . A complete waste of time . Killer metal eating flies ? What were they doing there and how was that related ? Just not worth watching . Watching paint dry is more fun . GIVE THIS MOVIE A BIG MISS. " ,1
" This movie is an insult to your intelligence . This movie is an absolute insult to the intelligence of its viewers . The plot is so damn garbled that you ca n't make any sense of it . The marketing of Microsoft Windows and other brands , just states its only purpose -- make money . Screw quality , screw anything else -LRB- the special effects are sub-par comparing to modern movies , BTW -RRB- . I have seen the original film from 1951 and it 's an average science fiction movie of that era . It 's full of religious ideas under the hood , which made it a bit stupid . Most films made around that time seem stupid nowadays anyway -LRB- IMO -RRB- ... In any case , there are many people that find it quite good . This 2008 remake is just and idiot 's attempt to make money from a film that had some aura from the past . Everyone that comes from a scientific background will try to rip the head from the skull watching this bag of nonsense . BTW , I could not even watch to the end , I had to quit because of that stupid , annoying kid . Never mind that , I can completely predict what will happen ... " ,1
" A very timely movie , and pretty entertaining to boot ... . I really enjoyed this film . Granted , I just saw it last night at the dollar theater , so I had heard all the negative reviews , and thought it may be worth a shot . Overall , the style of the film was very beautiful , and the plot seems pretty timely , especially if you 're interested in environmental possibilities of the future . The idea of aliens coming to the planet to decide the fate of humanity has been filmed before , and will be filmed again , but TDTESS does a great job of opening up a discussion about those possibilities , as well as the role of technology in society . Also , I have to say , I 've always been a big fan of Reeves and Connolly . They are very understated actors , and the minimal dialogue in this film allows them to act with movement instead of constant explication , which I found refreshing . All in all , a very enjoyable , beautiful , and thought-provoking film . " ,8
" This crap makes ` Gigli ' look like Casablanca ! . This movie was absolute CRAP . From beginning to end . Pure crap , and uh , oh yeah ! A HUGE steaming pile of CRAP !!! I wish IMDb had a rating of '' - ZERO '' since that 's the rating I would 've given this horrid attempt at , well , ANYTHING ! Deplorable acting . Bad , bad , BAD plot . Oh heck ! There are n't enough words to describe this utter catastrophe . Many of you have already been extremely eloquent in your dead on reviews . I could n't agree more . Keanu Reeves , one word : RETIRE . Awful . Awful . AWwwwwwwFUULLLLLLL . And what 's the deal with Jennifer Connelly ? What , after the critically successful , `` A Beautiful Mind '' she decided not to do good movies anymore ? What the ? I honestly can not believe HOW this piece of CRAP of a script got the `` green light '' . The filmmakers of this slosh must have been smoking some hard core dope to think this was actually going to be even mildly entertaining . Stay away from this . DO NOT waste one nano second of your life watching this garbage . Even when it 's on Channel 9 , very late at night , and your high on crack . " ,1
" A perhaps surprisingly decent remake\/sci-fi film . Alright it 's true I seem to have this odd love for these supposedly poor film remakes like The Fog , or Amityville Horror but I have never seen the original film that this remake is based on . This big budget spectacle looked particularly good and when I finally saw it I was not disappointed . The film does deliver a solid science fiction experience with plenty of stunning special effects but some unfortunately mild performances but usually mild actors . The plot of the film does n't particularly hold together completely perfectly and yet still you will find yourself enthralled and enjoying the movie despite these flaws . They are n't glaring flaws , just simply enough to make the film not do what they hoped it would at the box office . It would appear that a lot of IMDb reviewers have the same complaints ... they bad mouth direction and performances but also seem to insist that the film does n't fit together properly and that it does n't all add up the way it should . Many of these reviewers seem to be fans or have seen the original , something I have not . I do agree but on a different level because I did n't find these details severe enough to hinder my enjoyment of the film . Keanu Reeves certainly has his moments . He worked well for The Matrix films , his brooding tones work for strange romances and films like Constantine and other action films . Still I think Reeves has very , very little range as an actor and I think The Day The Earth Stood Still proves that in leaps and bounds . Reeves is dry , and monotone which is part the character and part the only way he can play the role . I do n't know who could have done better but I did n't feel he was the best for the part of the alien entity visiting Earth . Jennifer Connelly is brilliant scientist Dr. Helen Benson who is brought in on this world disaster at the last minute . I admit that I find Connelly a little dry and humorless and I 've never been blown away by her performances . Unfortunately this does n't change anything . I mean she does alright and her and Reeves actually have chemistry somehow -LRB- two wrongs make a right ? -RRB- Still she is kind of dull on the big scale . Jaden Smith is probably one of the better actors in the film , it does run in his blood and although he does n't have a huge role he does very well for a young actor . The supporting cast is impressive enough but they do n't utilize the talent enough . John Cleese is terrific in a small role , and Kathy Bates is decent as the Secretary of Defense . Cast unfortunately not withstanding the story and the special effects are the parts that really do make the film worthwhile . The movie is actually a solid sci-fi movie that is very watchable . Director Scott Derrickson is a new young director but he already blew me away with the impressive Exorcism of Emily Rose so he does have talent at telling a story . I could n't care less what comparison or lack of comparison there is to the original film . I do n't watch a remake to see the original one rehashed but rather what new actors , new film makers can do with an old story and I certainly enjoyed what they did . The film IS worth seeing and you 'll enjoy a sci-fi spectacle with some really terrific effects . 8\/10 " ,8
" Painful . This movie consists of a painful combination of important messages and frivolous nonsense . It could have been quite good but it was the opposite . For example : how does this plague of world-ending little insect ` things ' manage to rip through an entire football stadium in 3 seconds , while failing to put a dent in Reeve 's character 's human body ??? If you 're going to spend millions of dollars making a film , then why not try to iron out these blatant continuity flaws ? And what a sarcastic , precocious , horrible , annoying little brat Smith played ! I found myself hoping that his character would find his fate before the end of the film , but sadly this was n't to happen . I can only hope for Will 's sake he is n't like this at home . I personally think the aliens should have finished the job they started . To think that Connelly 's character could convince a higher life-form that her entire species can change is simply insulting . And what about McDonald 's , did n't they get a good deal ! One thing I ca n't stand is bloody product placement . I go to the movies so I do n't have to deal with the commercial garbage on TV , and what do I get ??? Bloody Maccas . Other insults included : 1 : Conveniently finding a telephone , and making it work by touching it with a finger . 2 : USA centred - the aliens landing in Manhattan -LRB- of course -RRB- , with only a few token mentions of other civilizations around the world who also happened to be affected . 3 : The endless ` classified ' jargon -LRB- the only thing that should have been classified was this damn film -RRB- . Now I 'm getting really stressed here just thinking about this . The reason I gave this movie 4 out of 10 -LRB- a generous mark considering my comments -RRB- , is because of the good special effects , the important message that it tried to convey and the fact that I 'm an easy marker overall . All in all , I hope something better arrives soon to restore my faith in postmodern cinema . " ,4
" Do not see this movie ! . This movie was a huge waste of time and money . I have not seen a worse movie in the past 5 years . I have never walked out of a movie theater before but I was sorely tempted to do so during this joke of a sci-fi remake . There are only two good things about this film : 1 -RRB- The sheer ridiculousness of what happens at several points in the movie made me laugh out loud . I 'm pretty sure this was not the reaction the filmmaker wanted , but I just could n't help myself . 2 -RRB- Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith . Their relationship was the only thing that resonated with me . Kathy Bates must be broke to appear in a crap-heap like this . " ,1
" Something you should know . If you are a true fan of the original film , skip this dog and buy the novel `` Plaatu 's Return '' . 20th Century Fox threatened the author to change the name of the character but it is still an outstanding sequel to the original film . It stays true to the essential message which this remake distorts . The 1951 version had a certain humanity about it that completely gets lost in this remake . Why Hollywood ca n't leave well enough alone is beyond me . Keanu Reeves is a sorry substitute for Michael Rennie . I highly recommend the book to all fans of the ogiginal film classic . It 's available at any bookstore . If and when the studio does a sequel , they will get it right next time . " ,1
" Add THIS to your list of environmental movies to avoid ! . On August 16 , 2008 , I wrote a review\/blog entitled '' ` The Happening ' - Just another environmental movie ! '' about how it seems that our entertainment industry has begun it 's own agenda in communicating the importance of `` going green '' \/ global warming \/ blah blah blah . So far , we 're either doing to be destroyed by meteors , `` natural '' , freaky weather phenomena or the very Planet Earth itself will turn onto itself and self-destruct . NOW , our entertainment industry in the movie , `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' is attempting to use fear to motivate us to contemplate that aliens will come and destroy humanity to save Planet Earth because of our environmental irresponsibility ! Aliens ? COME ON ! Needless to say , I had a free pass and did n't have to PAY for viewing this movie ! Thankfully , I had some vacation time and did n't mind wasting another 103 minutes of my life . " ,1
" Not a ` must see ' but a WHY GO ! . There was no real closure to this movie , it just ended . It was as if they ran out of money and could n't afford to finish . There was no character building within the movie . Additionally , for a science fiction movie to be good , it has to include science , not just fiction . There was no science from this geologist 's point of view . Movie makers should remake bad movies , not good ones . I can tolerate it when they are well done , but this movie had no heart , no soul or no real story . I would wager that there was less than half the amount of dialog than the original . The Klatu character was totally cold and lifeless , as if he were an android , not a living being . The original was a landmark in science fiction history , as it was the first movie where the alien was a good guy . This movie is an insult to the original . " ,4
" Only on the precipice do we evolve The Day the Earth Stood Still . . The new The Day the Earth Stood Still attempts to distance itself from the original , only keeping the character names and a very general backbone to the plot its script is based on the first film 's screenplay . While that could have freed the movie into becoming something new and different , the Hollywood machine decided to throw creativity out the window , making a bland , flashy popcorn flick , desperately trying to be pithy , yet only reinforcing how much better the original really is . You know things have gone wrong when writer David Scarpa decides to be clever , making the giant robot get named by the government as an asinine acronym . Why ca n't Klaatu just say that its name is Gort ? Why does the military have to call it G.O.R.T. ? It 's unnecessary and shows the sort of tongue-in-cheek callbacks that for some reason seem more important then telling an intriguing story . The most recognizable part of the first film is even completely cut out . How can you watch The Day the Earth Stood Still without the utterance of `` Klaatu barada nikto '' ? It 's just plain sacrilege . Rather than a tale about humanity 's destruction of themselves and their world , we get a thinly veiled commentary on how America is the cowboy of Earth , calling itself leader and making decisions without the input of other world powers . This is no longer a cautionary story about people 's negativity and proclivity for violence ; it has warped into the USA 's hubris and bullheadedness on topics such as survival . The country has aligned itself with a destroy all enemies before they can destroy us agenda , not realizing that by using force unprovoked will only therefore provoke the invading party , who will always be more powerful than us . As for the story itself , do n't expect a shot for shot remake here , there is a lot different . For one , Jennifer Connelly plays Helen Benson as an astrobiologist , integral to the government 's interaction with the aliens as opposed to some random woman at the lodging house Klaatu visits in the original . But again , that all makes sense being 2008 now , in a post-9 \/ 11 world . Gone are the days an alien can land in Central Park and be met by local police . Instead we need to have the government tracking the visitor during its descent , preparing for an attack , only allowing certain scientists access at the eleventh hour , the public only when impact occurs . So , Helen meets Klaatu while he is being incarcerated , leaving an indelible impression as she becomes the reason he is allowed to escape the facility and attempt to meet with the universe 's undercover agent Mr. Wu , -LRB- played by the always wonderful James Hong -RRB- . We then experience a collecting of lifeforms , a Noah 's Ark effect as Kathy Bates ' Secretary of State so obviously points out , as Klaatu prepares to let humanity die in order to save the planet a very rare commodity being that it can sustain complex life . On a purely special effects basis , there are definite reasons to watch this film . G.O.R.T. 's body 's disintegration into microscopic , multiplying , cutting insects is quite cool to behold . The rapid cracking of glass or dissolving of human tissue is well-orchestrated , not to mention the absolute destruction of Giants Stadium . Talk about a multi-million dollar effect that lasts about five seconds worth every penny . I even enjoyed the sphere work of thunderclouds and fluid smoke\/fog . And Klaatu 's healing power was a bit more advanced then needing Gort from the original to animate him again . Now , as long as he has a power source , the alien can jumpstart the vitals of a recently killed policeman , dead as a result of his now savior . There are also a lot of good actors involved , all of who seem wasted . Besides Connelly , only Keanu Reeves ' Klaatu is given ample screen time . It 's a role that he is built for devoid of emotion anyone who is n't a fan for that reason should enjoy his wooden delivery finally working perfectly . I joke , though , as I 'm a fan of his , it 's just an easy comment to make , and I 'm sure many do . As for the rest of the cast , I really liked John Cleese as a subdued Nobel Prize winning scientist . Without bombast , yet still with some humor , he appears to single-handedly plant the bug into Klaatu 's head that Earth may be worth saving . And being that this very important role in the first film only gets about five minutes of facetime here , that 's quite the feat . As for Jaden Smith , who shined in Pursuit of Happiness , I ca n't say the same . Maybe it is the script 's fault for being so ham-fisted , but I just got annoyed with him . Always complaining , always rebelling , always being selfish , the part was written to progress the plot and it unfortunately shows . That is the main problem here ; it is all so obvious and contrived that you lose all sense of wonder and intrigue . You know that the boy 's father 's death as a military man will come into play , you know that him calling his stepmother Helen so emphatically will have a reversal before the film 's end , and you know that somehow everything will be OK . My biggest gripe , however , is with the ending . Stop reading now if you do n't want anything spoiled , although you should know how it ends by now anyways , but Klaatu just leaves ? He is about to destroy humanity and because a son finally calls his mother `` mom '' , even though right after that the US government attempts to blow him up , he decides to give them a second chance ? Without even meeting world leaders to explain what they need to do ? I guess extra-terrestrials give us way too much credit , because if that was I , there 's no way we 'd survive the night . If anything , the US will just start saying they scared him off and were victorious against the intruders . I do n't see an entire nation acquiring enough humility to save itself in that short of time . " ,4
" a real weepy . I love movies , let me start by saying that . They 're not a hobby , they 're a passion that grew in me from a very early age when my dad used to carry me on a Friday night , in my pyjamas under my coat , to the cinema that was literally 50-60 metres away on the corner of our street . Many of the movies that I saw in my childhood left lasting impressions on me , good impressions by the way , and as I grew up I was able to relive the magic of these movies when they were shown on T.V. . The Day The Earth Stood Still is one of those movies ... fantastic , simple , not over-burdened with lavish special effects or action , just a great story , told and acted so well by Michael Rennie and Co. . I have no objection to any classic being remade in principal , look how well Peter Jackson lovingly -LRB- the keyword . . lovingly -RRB- remade his favorite movie from his childhood . He handled it with tender care , using today 's technology to enhance , not overshadow , what is after all a love story . If anything Peter Jackson made it , dare I say ? , better . The love was now two-way instead of one-way . Now to my point , I usually only cry at sad movies , but after witnessing the butcher 's mess that this movie is , I really felt like breaking down . It 's like some idiot painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa and then having the temerity to expect us to applaud his work . I never tell people to not go to see a movie just because I have seen it and did n't like it ... but in this case I 'll say to older moviegoers who may have the fond memories that I have , if you want to see an inept desecration of a classic that is served up with such banality and a misuse of the best elements of the original , then go and see it ... and weep !!!! " ,1
" Flat characters , unimaginative writing . The kid , Jacob Benson , wants nothing more than to kill the aliens . Five minutes after he turns Klaatu in to the military , Klaatu saves him from `` the precipice '' as he 's about to fall a few feet into water . In that instant , Jacob becomes Klaatu 's best friend . A little later , at his father 's grave , the kid cries for about 30 seconds with his stepmother . Up until then he had shown nothing but contempt for her , to her face and behind her back . After that , he calls her mom . Klaatu has been convinced by his spy that humans are not worth saving . He repeats several times how we do n't deserve to continue as a species , yet when he sees this deep emotional outpouring at the cemetery he decides that humans are worth saving after all . There are more of these contrived , unbelievable character turnarounds `` at the precipice '' . When they put the robot in a silo to examine it they already knew its eye was dangerous , but guess what was 10 feet in front of the control center windows ? And why did GORT wait until after several unsuccessful attempts to examine\/destroy him before beginning the sterilization of the planet ? Klaatu had been saying for hours that the process had begun . Probably what bothers me the most is the incredible conceit Klaatu demonstrates . He decides that humans do not have the right to make mistakes on the planet they evolved on , but outsiders have the right to annihilate the native species based on their criteria . Does that mean the writers think that nation X has the right to destroy nation Y because X has decided that Y is being callous with its resources ? I guess the message is `` Might Makes Right '' . The original was a little better , Klaatu said that what we do to our own planet is our business . The other planets did n't step in until we had the potential to be a threat to them . " ,3
" Started with a bang , died with a whimper ... . The first hour of watching this seemed like the film had the potential to be a great movie . This rapidly changed however . One of the reasons I was not a big fan of the film `` Close Encounters Of The Third Kind '' was that it was , well , really dumbed down and outright patronizing and yes , the remake of the great original `` Day The '' fell into the same pit of patronizing and arrogance . In Close Encounters you had an extremely advanced civilization from light years away and who were technology wise eons ahead of us reduced to finishing a silly musical expression - that was just so wise of us ? Was n't it ? Almost along long the lines of when your trying to signal somebody by banging on a pipe and having the other person do the final two bangs . I think emus show greater sophistication ... And in `` The Day The Earth Stood Still '' remake you have an alien who is part of a group who has had a presence on this planet for 80 years suddenly figure out that human beings can show compassion to one another and are indeed capable of change . He witnesses this with the interaction of Jennifer Connolly character and her son and he suddenly decides that were worth saving after all , so he ends the systematic destruction of humanity and goes back to his ship and takes off and everything is fine , the end . Bad . Real Bad . If humans really think that aliens are this shallow and unsophisticated we deserve to be destroyed for our pompous arrogance . There are some good points , the CG stuff is stunning , all the elements seem to be there to make a really good movie but the butchering of a real good story ruins everything . If it had only stuck more to the original story line it could have been great - Benevolent space fascist who come here , make a huge point by making everything powered stop and telling us that if we take are aggressions to space we will be reduced `` to a burned out cinder '' . I often wish someone like this would come and eliminate that piece of real estate in Jerusalem -LCB- the place where the Dome Of The Rock sits atop the Temple of David -RCB- `` Because you ca n't stop fighting about it , we will just reduce the whole thing to ashes , take it off the table and give it a half life of a hundred thousand years '' Perfect . What has happened to this huge budget remake is almost along the lines of having a really tricked out , uber extravagant Ferrari at your disposal and turning it over to some idiot who fouls the engine up by filling it up with diesel . . The original film was actually quite quaint when compared to the big time special effects of today but none the less still a classic . The remake with everything it had at its disposal sans decent writing - could have been wonderful , the pieces were in place and it was driven off a cliff by idiots . All the special effects in the world can not cancel out insipid writing , ever . Oh , did I forget to mention that Keanu Reeves is a really wooden actor ? How is that for a profound statement ? Right along the lines of `` OJ really did kill his wife '' or `` Nuclear war is bad '' . I remember about 10 years ago asking a film buff friend of mine -LCB- One Jose Sinatra -RCB- `` Bill , why have they not remade The Day The Earth Stood Still ? '' His response was simple , he said `` Darryl , your such a A # % hole ! `` Maybe some classic movies should just be left alone ... duhduduuuuh ! ... god , how many time this has proved true , The Jazz Singer or A Star Is Born comes to mind . Do n't waste your money going to the theater to see this , rent it if you must , but do n't give this movie any undeserved box office ... there are a ton of much better movies out now . . D " ,3
" Do not waste your time on this film . . This movie had great potential , great funding and a fantastic predecessor . Unfortunately the story line , script , appalling ending and Keanu ' I cant act in anything but monotone '' Reeves factor weighing it down to the point where I nearly walked out many times . the only believable acting was John Cleese 's 5 minute performance . What does humanity learn from this apocalyptic near catastrophe ? nothing ! we get away with it because Smith Jr deceives everyone and has a cry ?!?!?!? I think we should have been wiped out and then it just shows 10 minutes of beautiful untouched scenery then the credits roll . way better and actually sending a bit of a message . Gutted . this could have been awesome . " ,1
" The Day The Earth Sold Out ... . I 'm a huge fan of Mr Reeves but this is one huge clunker of a remake , hard to put into words how disappointing this film is on every level . After hearing the director and cast talking about the movie and patiently waiting for it to be released they should n't have bothered , black marks for all the usual suspects associated with this so called piece of cinematic tripe . We can only write a 1000 words in this review , but if anyone gets close to that they deserve a medal , please save your hard earned cash and give to a more deserving cause . " ,4
" How To Ruin A Classic . Growing up in the 50 's 60 's , I grew up with the original Day The Earth Stood Still and had memorized Klaatu 's famous words my whole life -LRB- in case I ever needed to disarm Gort -RRB- . I was about as excited as anyone when I saw the first preview come out and had hopes that I would be seeing my favorite black and white sci-fi movie replaced with an all new , up to date , high tech remake . Well , it was a major disappointment . The story line was damaged beyond compare as they added stupid scenes as the army leader with the hillbilly accent attacking Gort , the terrible casting for the secretary of state and the whiny little kid who kept changing his mind . The worst disappointment was that this movie seemed to be another pitch for how we are ruining this planet for our animal friends . The little Noah 's Ark spheres were ridiculous . You may be one of those people -LRB- like me -RRB- who has to see this movie no matter what you read about it . If you are , keep your expectations way low . If you are not , let me encourage you to just rent or buy the original and leave your memory of the original unscathed and save your hard earned dollars . " ,2
" The Day The Earth Stood Still . I thought Jumper is a bad sci-fi movie , but I was wrong . The Day The Earth Stood Still came out as silly and to be honest , a bit corny . The message is good , but because the acting and the screenplay were so bad , I could n't enjoy this movie at all . Believe me , I had high hopes for the first fifteen minutes , then a big robot came out and I gave up . They did n't handle the movie with respect and it showed . Reeve 's acting was wooden and forgettable . He is good looking , but lack with charisma . I could n't take anything seriously about him , he is not a spectacular actor . Other cast members done their parts with decent quality , nothing special . The special effects were quite good , but overdone in some parts . Too much money was spent in this area and the storyline became neglected . Overall , The Day The Earth Stood Still is a bad movie , but still watchable . I have to admit that even though High School Musical 3 is a corny movie , it 's still more entertaining than this . " ,3
" boe_dye wonders : Why do I even spend money going to the theater anymore ? . And I 'm not even talking about P2P , torrents , camera rips , screeners , or the multitudes of video hosting sites . I am talking about consistently being disappointed by the crap that is churned out by Hollywood that I blindly pay for . Yes , the acting was fine , and in all honesty there are very rarely any movies out there that have bad acting , bad sequences or bad anything . Most actors are character actors and as long as they play their part , then the film usually does well . Keanu Reeves . Black Suit , Black Tie , White Button Up Shirt . Hmmmm . Constantine , The Matrix , Johnny Pneumatic , etc. . Jennifer Connely . Cold , yet passionate , scientist\/Dr , John Cleese . He 's old . He has class , and there that is . The movie . One politically correct , product placement plug after another . Yes , we get it , Microsoft rules the world . Yes , drive a hybrid save the planet . Yes , humans are a infectious disease that is killing the Earth and the only thing that can save us are the benevolent space creatures who literally say `` change or die '' and bring peace at the end of the threat of annihilation . Sure , the first one more or less said the same thing to a degree , you have the choice to be `` like us , peaceful and without want , or face genocide '' . And apparently no one has ever thought to ask the peace loving aliens how many times they bring up that ultimatum because they always seem a little to comfortable with that idea . Never the less , what this lacked in intelligence and story telling it of course made up for flashy effects , and millions of dollars of computer animation . In all honesty it is n't even fair to that this is a re-make as it is nearly an entirely different movie . Sure there was `` Klatuu '' , and `` Gort '' , and thematically it was loosely the same , but the premise was different , as was the resolution . No one really learned or benefited from the destruction caused by Gort , and the majority of destruction was n't even caused by him as it was caused by the stupid , puny humans who still thought that they were in control , and that when all else fails , blow the problem to hell . Sure maybe some did learn , but considering that there were still workers in a car factory building cars -LRB- no doubt more hybrids -RRB- at the end of the film while the ensuing crisis was going on , it really made it hard to believe that humanity at large really cared at all . And while the original was dealing with the issue of the Cold War as the cause of the damnation of Earth , it at least took the time to point out that the `` war '' was absurd and that the Russians were in just as much a situation as we were . Honestly anymore , unless a movie comes out that is an original idea as opposed to a remake , I am not even going to bother anymore . Organizations like the MPAA are running around trying to place blame on why movie sales are down . They would have us believe that those `` evil P2P file sharers '' are the cause for the low ticket sales . They would also probably have us believe that it is the recession too . But the truth of the matter is that the movies coming out are simply crap . The story lines are all glitz and no substance , and whenever a movie does come out that is supposed to be `` intelligent '' it usually ends in a depressing tragedy in order to get you to `` think '' . There are no more heroes , just tortured characters who 's choices are what separates them from good or evil . And most of the time instead of seeing a movie , as is in this particular case , we see an advertisement for a political agenda . " ,4
" Boring and Annoying . This is a very boring movie . The second half of the movie just drags into nothingness with a anti climactic ending . The aliens are laughable . The environmental message is preachy and heavy handed and not well thought out . It fails as a deep drama . Acting is OK : Keanu is supposed to be a blank stone so he 's okay . Jennifer Connolly is earnest . Jaden Smith can act but his character is irritating beyond belief . In the end the characters are just not sympathetic at all . Do n't waste your time - you 'll just end up frustrated and annoyed that you bothered to sit through it . " ,1
" What a miserable failure on many levels . 1 . Very barren and sterile script 2 . No real plot , I suppose humans are vermin ? 3 . Bad acting , Jordan Smith is so stiff I really think he 'll find fewer jobs after this play act 4 . Klaatu ? Well , who knows what he -LRB- I suppose it was a he -RRB- really was about . It seemed to me if humans were supposed to change , they showed absolutely no sign of it at any point in the dumb flick , including when the Earth was devoured in part , but for some reason left in shambles when the Alien departs \/ It is a waste of time . I ca n't imagine paying for a theater ticket to watch this thing . It was regrettable enough I rented it wasting more than an hour , paying 3 bucks in the process . " ,1
" It Should Have Been a Sequel ! . Sorry , but this film was weak , flimsy and in the wrong hands with an immature director and a poorly written , misguided script . When one sees the how the film was made documentary , one can see all the what not to do things that abound in this project . Poor casting and a shallow music score made it even worse . Now , if I were asked to do this , I would start where the other film leaves off . It should be a sequel where Klaatu leaves us with a warning in 1951 and returns in 2009 with a conviction . Some of the plot lines would include scenes where the extremely wealthy make plans to leave the planet by means of space projects only they could afford to develop , while the rest of us have to come to terms with our true power -- our poorly developed inner nature where we must discover our ability to love and care about life beyond all previous capacity : a kind of humane revelation happens . Also , we would get to witness the intergalactic counsel and see some of what life is like in other regions of the universe where peace has been achieved , and where it has not . Indeed , a sequel would be a much stronger way to do this film . It gives us a chance to see what has been done between nations , cultures , and the environment over the past nearly 60 years . What a fantastic opportunity to look at what humans have been doing during this period . And now we are discovering hundreds of planets in the universe , there is so much that could have been brought to the story that would give us reasons to deeply contemplate our situation , and our ability to discover a way for humanity to come together for the welfare of all life . By the way , the spaceship was a waste of time as well -- looks soooooo CG ! The bright spot is this movie is bad enough there 's hope that one day someone will come forward with a beautiful , compelling and inspiring sequel -- not a remake . I wish I could help make it .

" The Day the Film Jammed . This film is lost , lost , lost , and going nowhere . It has been misconceived , has no point , is overdone like a burnt steak , and just think of all the money they wasted on producing this rambling , directionless , self-indulgent failure . Strangely enough , I rather liked the central performance by Keanu Reeves as the visiting alien . Some people might say it was wooden and inexpressive . But it was chillingly convincing , and more or less the way an alien of that sort would act -LRB- I know several , they come from a rival planet , and would never be allowed on mine -RRB- . I actually admired the sturdy determination of Reeves to maintain continuity of mood throughout this mayhem , where crazy things were happening all around him and he had to put up with Jennifer Connelly and her obnoxious , thoroughly revolting brat . Why on earth -LRB- even if it were standing still -RRB- did anyone choose Jennifer Connelly for the role of the woman ? -LRB- One can not call her the ` love interest ' because Keanu Reeves , as an alien with no expression , is above such things , or below them , or whatever . -RRB- Even when they are trapped in a car on long dangerous drives , looking at each other meaningfully , the meaning has nothing to do with males and females but more to do with dogs and cats . Connelly looks haunted , but for the wrong reasons . She seems not to have slept in ten years . She really should take a holiday and freshen up . Why are her eyes so sunken and tired ? She does not add any zip to the action , she makes us want to go have a nap or we will look like her . Reeves has never looked better , even when he was a young buck with doe eyes -LRB- is that a contradiction ? -RRB- The DVD of this film offers us the original film starring Michael Rennie as an extra . ` Oldies but goodies ! ' Bring back the days when they knew how to make a science fiction film properly for only a tiny budget and impress the hell out of us ! The worst thing about the film is the appalling son of Jennifer Connelly . I do n't want to mention the unfortunate boy actor 's name , I just want to point out that the whole thing stinks . What is this obsession they have in Hollywood with putting disgusting children in every film who then have to be worshipped by cringeing , apologetic , neurotic parents ? Is it because all parents are now cringeing and neurotic ? Or all children have now become that offensive , sneering , sulky , and arrogant ? And has anyone noticed that Connelly is as white as parchment while her ` son ' is , well , what shall I say ? I do n't want to commit a ` hate crime ' by pointing out that he differs rather extremely in hue . As we all know , we are n't permitted anymore to mention any skin color other than white without getting arrested . But is n't this carrying black tokenism in films to insane extremes ? What a mess . Further comment about this meandering , unfocused , pointless exercise in cinematic vanity would be an offense to those electrons who sacrifice their lives to appear on our computer screens . Or should I now say those liquid crystals who offer themselves for annihilation on the altar of a potassium carbonate plastic glass , so that we may all read and write in cyberspace ? This is a sci fi review , after all . -LRB- And as for the plague of metal locusts in the film , come on ! Let 's get unreal ! -RRB- " ,1
" GREAT remake of an old classic . I think people are missing the message within this film , saying it has none , it 's an insult to the original , but they 're all wrong . BOTH movies have a great message , and both are true . In the original version Klaatu comes to Earth to warn humanity of its violent nature and that they need to change . It seems to me that those who have reviewed this movie and said it has no message whatsoever obviously were n't watching the movie but more so looking for reasons to hate it . First off , with any remake or adaptation you should n't compare it to the original , it 'll make you hate it . Like with the Spiderman movies , so many people hated those simply because it was n't like the comics . Hello ? NONE of the comic book movies are that close to the comics ! In any case , the reason why they changed the movie 's message for this version is because of the time we 're living in . Yes it 's obvious we 're still a very violent race , but this version is expressing the message which the majority of humanity has STILL been ignoring ! GLOBAL WARMING !!!! It 's why in this version the aliens have a weapon which destroys humanity and any of their creations while the other races of Earth remain protected in an orb which acts like an ark . Oh well , guess people are going to ignore it still until it 's too late . But as the professor said in this movie , humanity will change once it 's at the brink of destruction . To finish off , this is a great movie , especially if you give it a chance . I do n't suggest watching the original before seeing this movie . Reason goes the same as trying to read the Lord of the Rings books before watching the movies . They 're so different you should just forget about the original and ENJOY the new one . Just because you enjoy or love one , does n't mean you have to hate the other . " ,10
" much more than just sci-fi and alien invasion ! socio-critical and moving . I 'm surprised at some of the comments to say the least . I do realize that I 'm the overwhelming minority by saying this but I thought the film was absolutely brilliant . The first 30 minutes were very much `` science fiction '' . Danger from outer space , we have to save the earth , scientists are `` kidnapped '' to help the world , etc , etc. . . pretty good yet not fantastic sci-fi ... Then with the `` birth '' of Klaatu the movie progresses into a somewhat socially critical film . There were some quotes which I remembered because they were so striking and I was surprised at the values that were conveyed : e.g. Klaatu demands to speak to the world leaders and asks the Secretary of Defense -LRB- ? -RRB- `` Do you speak for the entire human race ? '' when she replies `` I speak for the President of the United States '' . I could n't help but wonder throughout the movie : Does America speak for the human race ? I think it 's a highly topical issue and subtly addressed in the movie . Another scene that I could n't forget was the description by the alien disguised as an old Chinese : `` The terrible thing is they sense which direction they are going but they are doing nothing '' -LRB- or something along those lines -RRB- . Also memorable was the action around the little kid . Very in-depth character portrayal ... the pain about his dead father and this being the reason for why he fights Klaatu until the showdown in the graveyard scene ... and last but not least humanity trying to fight off the alien `` invaders '' . Klaatu says it himself when the boy asks him whether he would fight or run away and he says `` There is nothing you can do '' . Yet it was ironic to see how people think that there means of weaponry stands a chance against alien forces . Very smug indeed ! I also liked the dramatical means that when the giant alien robot attacks earth he lifts up his arms in a surrendering pose . The effect this had on me was that I realized once more that the `` invaders '' are not the villains but just doing what they think is right ... There are many more details worth mentioning but some specifics eluded me . All I can say is that the movie is much more than sci-fi . It 's highly philosophical , moving -LRB- especially the story of the young boy -RRB- and well done . If that 's what you expect from movies then I 'd strongly recommend this film ... even if you are not into science fiction ! Look deeper cause there is a lot to see here !!! " ,10
" Nice on the Small Screen ; see it if you 're a fan of the original . . First off , if you are a fan of the original , like me , you will see this movie in spite of all the good or bad reviews . It is a different take on the original while dealing with much of the same themes ; namely , our tendency to destroy ourselves , others and everything . What I found fascinating was the film 's take on the character of Klaatu , which seemed more realistic and more alien than the original . Also , I liked the reason for the the visitation ... which , like the original , was not the conventional invasion theme . Unfortunately , this central reason , which lies at the core of the film , has been so frequently preached , that I felt it was basically lost on the choir . But if you can bear that and go along for the ride , I think you will enjoy it . Like the recent X-Files film , seen on a big screen , the CGI flaws and lack of big whiz bang special effects , will be very apparent and the film will seem more remote . But a smaller-artsy-screen -LRB- 20 ' X 50 ' -RRB- seems to make it easier to connect with ; for this reason , I have a feeling that it will be a cult classic once it hits the DVD and large flat screen TV viewing crowd . The movie could have done more character development and been much more complex , for our times . But in such complicated times , sometimes it 's just nice to go see a simple movie with basic themes . " ,7
" A Better Solution to an Old Problem . So far every review I 've read has been negative about this movie . To each-his-own . This movie recreates the same problem -LRB- humanity being a threat to the world , itself , and the universe -RRB- but gives a better and more mature solution to the problem than the original film . In the 1951 film , the best solution that the writers could come up with was forcing humanity to behave under the threat of violence from a force greater than us . The 2008 version of this film gives a much more sophisticated answer : that being the beauty of the human condition and the need for a people to face the precipice in order to embrace necessary change . Although this solution may have been better served by not being so overt , it still shows the growth in our thinking . The simple fact that the first version 's solution was merely a new threat of violence , while the remake 's solutions was to see that the beauty of our human condition makes our existence meaningful , made the remake worthwhile . The role that Jaden Smith played was tremendously annoying . But I think that was the goal . He was the archetype for what mankind is : an annoying , untrusting , and overly-simplistic child-race . Although his sudden change into maturity was anything but smooth , he again represented the degree to how abruptly mankind would need to grow-up if we ever face similar situations . I think this movie was an amazing look into the ongoing development and maturing of mankind . It shows that even our creative side -LRB- Hollywood -RRB- has grown up since the original film . It shows that humanity does n't need a greater threat of violence to make us mature ; we merely need to look at the beauty of our human dilemma , and to draw from that strength to grow . Idealistic ? Probably . But hey - that 's why it 's a movie . " ,8
" Not deserving of the respect to warn about any spoilers . Warning - Major spoilers ! : This movie was by far the dumbest excuse for elitist Hollywood to ram another subliminal morality message down our throats . Ironically , Klaatu and his consortium of allegedly advanced civilizations left more damage to the planet than they were trying to conserve . Furthermore , Klaatu never offered any explanation as to how humans were destroying the Earth - it was simply assumed to be an incontrovertible truth without any scientific evidence whatsoever . That 's not factual at all , but typical to liberal propaganda . And if Klaatu and his crew were supposedly so much more fair minded and advanced , then why did they resort to any level of violence ? There should have been no need to defend themselves at all . As a species , they could have simply persuaded us through electrical telepathy , like during Klaatu 's lie detector test , similarly to how liberals play their zombie mind games anyhow . I especially appreciate the part when Klaatu informs the police officer who is about to shoot him , `` This will only hurt for a moment . '' , then proceeds to roll a vehicle to crush the officer between cars . Of course , Klaatu jump starts the officer back to life , but advanced beings would never place themselves in these predicaments in the first place . Symbolically , the final message is - the world would be a better place if civilization crumbled without a trace and without further consumption of our natural resources . I suppose that would leave us to run around in the forests subject to random predators and elements much like our ancestors did more than 10,000 years ago . Yes , I can definitely see how that existence would mark a tremendous improvement to our quality of life ! Leave it to liberals and their hair brained fantasies . They should stop making movies and seclude themselves in their bass ackward communes where they belong . " ,1
" What a piece of CRAP . This movie is terrible . What a waste of time . Let me start off by saying that no one should watch this thing even if they 're paid . It 's really that bad . What is the worst part of this film ? That 's easy . It 's that little f \* cking kid who you want to see blown up or vaporized . Unfortunately that does n't happen . He just keeps destroying every scene he 's in and even the scenes he 's NOT in ! He drags the entire film down , more so than the stupid plot . Coming in a close second is that horrible Kathy Bates . How she got cast is beyond me , but then again that f \* cking kid was cast so anything is possible in this film . Keanu Reeves has been wearing the same suit in nearly every film he 's in . Enough with the black suit and tie already . The reason for this is so you 'll think about The Matrix whenever you 're considering buying a ticket to one of his movies . Well , the Matrix films are over and Keanu Reeves sucks . He makes terrible films and he 's paid lots of money to do so . He does n't care if they 're good or not . And ever since Matrix Reloaded his films have all been bad . He 's fooled me for the last time . Do people even read scripts before putting millions of dollars into them ? I guess not . This one is full of mistakes . I wo n't go into all of them because they 're listed in the other reviews here . Nothing makes much sense and nothing is even remotely entertaining . Jennifer Connely is the step-mom of that evil kid ? Why would she even want that little whining mean spirited bastard around her in the first place ? Her husband was a soldier\/engineer and was killed and\/or died ? Why is this unnecessary background story so complicated ? This movie is so left-wing they could n't even say Connely 's dead husband was a soldier . He had to be an engineer ! Why was the U.S. portrayed as hostile ? Another save the planet from humans environmentalist wacko story ? Who made this liberal - minded movie , MSNBC and Al Gore ? There is nothing funnier than when Reeves is asked his name and he says KLAATU . What a moron . I 've written too much about this garbage . Do not spend your time and money on it . " ,1
" A Perfectly Good Waste of Time and Money . How I was ever talked in to going to a movie starring Keanu Reeves ... must have been the major medication . Between he and the eye-candy of Jennifer Connelly , the total acting ability is the equivalent of two farts in a cyclone . We did n't get to see the magnificent Gort -LRB- Genetically Organized Robotic Technology -RRB- for more than a few minutes , the special effects were creative but totally over the top , which was a shame because that is in effect the foundation of this movie . And how they managed to completely under use the talents of John Cleese is almost incomprehensible . Under developed story line , and under developed characters made the remake 100 % unremarkable , especially when contrasted with the 1951 original . Save yourself the trip . See this dog on disc , if you can even stand to see it then . " ,3
" Klaatu barada no-go . I could actually write a review of this film with one word : Wha ? But to elaborate ... What were they thinking ? Sure , they got a good title to work with . `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' is a title that always had kick , but the people who made the remake did n't seem to understand it was more than the title that made the original film work . When Michael Rennie as Klaatu comes down to Washington D.C. in the original film , there was a political subtext set in place . But , lo and behold , what made the film work is that after being captured by the military industrial complex Klaatu gives them the slip and finds himself among the common people to learn what makes them tick . This notion was almost completely abandoned in the remake , and replaced with Klaatu dealing with scientists . Patricia Neal was so likable and believable in the original . She felt very much like one of us . Jennifer Connelly 's scientist character in the remake could never hope to connect with audiences the same way . Not her fault , either . Some critics have blasted Connelly 's performance , but it was her character and the script that are to blame , not her . She tried . No one could make saying , `` Give us another chance ! '' over and over again work . When I first heard that the film was being remade I was certainly curious about the casting . When I saw that Keanu Reeves would play Klaatu , it was a clear sign that the studio had no idea what they were dealing with . On the other hand , what if they had been a bit more adventurous and Jennifer Connelly would play Klaatu ? Much better idea making the alien a woman . But do n't switch the roles . Keanu would have to go . Not that he was bad as Klaatu as it was written . As written Reeves was perfect . But the concept of Klaatu as somewhat robotic and emotionless works against the basic concept . And the whole idea of changing the mission to one of destruction because Earthlings were going to destroy the planet does not have as much resonance as the original idea of Earthlings ability to threaten the intergalactic universe with nuclear power . And the remake uses the earth standing still as the climax of the film . Why ? Something seemed missing . The film needed another 20 mins . No `` klaatu barada nikto '' to stop Gort from destroying the planet . No , now we have a swarm of robotic locust that just magically stop destroying everything in their path when Keanu goes inside the space globe . Now the new Klaatu being able to see the heart of humanity was a good idea , but it was just clumsily handled . The graveyard scene was supposed to draw memories of the original film , but the emotional moment between the kid , Jaden Smith , and Connelly was not earned , even though the performances were okay . This is why everyone is saying Smith and Connelly were such bad actors . The script did n't earn their performances . And what was that stupid scene at the beginning of the movie with that guy in the snow storm -LRB- also played by Keanu -RRB- ? We see he 'd been used to take a sample so the alien Klaatu could enter Earth 's atmosphere , but a line of dialog later explains that perfectly . No need for that long opening sequence . Add more time to explain what happens to earth now that everything has stood still . Because at the end of the film , all I could think was ... wha ? " ,2
" Oh the inhumanity of it all ... again . And here we go again , yet another remake of a classic that 's not only missed the point but so wide of the mark that its out of the park ... A few points , Reeves as Klatu worked for me , Gort was far too big and looked like he was from some game for pc or other consul , very nice big fx shots but for the most of it , completely unnecessary , it missed the ` demonstration ' to earth , there was no real tension , its like a lot of modern remakes , they look cg now , they look like there a video game , maybe that 's the appeal to the younger generation to go see this stuff , I doubt most that liked the remake would like the original version and there are always a few who will think the remake is the original ... Now I expect I will have a few people rad this and moan at me for even saying such things but everyone likes different things in a film , me , I like story , plot , development , cg is great if its not used to completely disguise the fact that 's its a poor film . So on that basis I only give it a 2 rating , it really is a shame because it could have been so much better ... " ,2
" The previews were the best parts of the movie ... . \*\*\* Contains small spoilers \*\*\* This movie may have been welcomed better if it came out 10 years ago . It just did n't quite do the trick . Took a while to `` break the ice '' and once it did , the pace stayed exactly the same the entire movie . It was a very slow paced film and VERY predictable , coming from someone who did n't know anything about it from books and originals ... etc. . Honestly , my 8 year old nephew figured it out about 3\/5 of they through the movie . He even guessed the kid would be the one that turns him in , which really was n't that hard to figure out by the way he was acting and talking about Keanu . I 'm a Keanu fan and although it did seem interesting , from previews and trailers , Keanu may have been the biggest reason I went to see it . Now I 'm a bit unsure about his recent choices in roles . Wait for a rental . Save your money . " ,4
" A good movie violated for an actor nobody likes . . Hollywood ran out of ideas so they decided to recolor old hit films . My prognoses : our grandkids in 50 years will remake this film for home entertainment 3D emitters and it will be no better . The original story `` You have atom bombs . The scared people of space decided to subdue you or blow up your planet . And we do n't care if you ca n't fly beyond your solar system '' for a plot passed for its time . Now this is somewhere between A and B movies . The new plot is basically the same , except Klaatu is late half a century and is edgy to act . The actors all act a terrorist-like movie . They are too emotional to be reasonable . If you are n't in the mood -LRB- or a liberal -RRB- when you see this , simple logical questions will start popping in to your head . Why assemble all scientists in the epicenter of the crash to brief them before evacuating ? Why think that you can survive something so big and traveling so fast ? When ET gets shot , what good will the human medic or doctor be ? You 'd think they would have a bulletproof space suit micrometeorites are no laughing matter . Once again US takes the role of world leaders -LRB- enraging everybody else -RRB- and never give up their pride to except that they got nothing to through at the alien force . You 'd think US would be reasonable ? Try to gather info before becoming utterly deaf paranoid to work out a short-term deal and get some alien tech to fortify Earth ? No , they go extremely paranoid as if fighting regular terrorist with a nuke . Will anybody be interested in catching an escaped convict when an UFO is parked in New York Park and nobody knows what will happen ? Why go Chinese with subtitles and then go English when nobody relay cares what two aliens are talking about ? If another person knowing Chinese were to pass by , would he care ? You 'd thing Gort would react to being boxed ? And so on , and so on . Oh it makes my head hurt and that 's the first half of the movie . The second half went its own separate way , throwing away all good that was in the old film , to replace it with a `` end of the world '' religious parody . It became tiresome to watch . The nanites had some entertainment , but that did little to help a dieing movie . Things stopped making sense . No nukes were launched , so no human EMP was used to stop them . What does `` I ca n't risk the survival of one planet for the sake of one species '' even mean ? What do you need Erath for ? A botanic garden to neglect for a millennia or two ? You guys never heard of terraforming and colonization ?! How did these aliens even become so powerful without those two skills ? Oh the Gods , no sense at all . I wanted to see this movie as to find out what happened in the first . Well , I was disappointed from the start , and then I was tortured with an even lamer than any 50s plot . The original message `` be pacifists '' was rejected for something illogical . Oh the horror . Do n't pay to see this . IT 'S NOT WORTH A CENT . " ,1
" Rent the old version , this one is n't worth watching . I like the actors , and the special effects are interesting , though I 'd rather an actual spaceship than a godlike weather sphere . The problem is that they have mangled the story into the unrecognizable . The old story concerned aliens coming to Earth to warn us that our violent ways would not be tolerated in the stars . We were suitably violent and given a slap and told to mend our ways . Klatuu was pleasant and good and was actually trying to help us change . The new story turns that on it 's head . Klatuu 's people in this one think our planet is a precious resource we do n't `` deserve '' and are here to pass judgement on us -- now -- with no real attempt to avoid it . Not only is this presumptuous , it 's hypocritical given that according to Klatuu , his people only reformed when they had their own cataclysm . Now they 're reformed drunks , looking to exterminate anyone else having a drink . Between the ridiculous story and the pathetic writing , one has very little sympathy for Klatuu or his people . You might aspire to live in the peaceful galaxy of the original story , but not this one . The only advice I 'd give Earth in this story is to start working on their own nano-dissassemblers for the next time some super-powerful bozo from this collection of idiots comes calling . " ,3
" Disappointing remake of a classic . I ca n't say I was surprised that this movie was a dud -LRB- a local paper gave it 1 1\/2 stars out of 4 -RRB- but I still wanted to see it because I feel the 1951 original is among the best science fiction movies ever made . This 2008 version is n't nearly as good . At first glance one might think this is the sort of role that 's made for Keanu Reeves -LRB- with his notorious lack of normal affect -RRB- , but Michael Rennie 's Klaatu was compelling in the original because he clearly cared about his mission and the beings who would be affected by it . More importantly , the scenario in this 2008 film is based on a very vague premise about the danger posed to the biosphere of Earth by humanity itself - which may be true , but is never explained in detail ; rather , the premise rests on audience knowledge of media coverage about global warming and threats to biological diversity - which again may be true , but remains a nebulous threat to the average person . In contrast , the threat of nuclear war was very immediate and real in 1951 when the original film was released -LRB- indeed , the film was released in the middle of the Korean War when use of nuclear weapons was openly contemplated -RRB- , and it would not be hard for the average viewer to imagine extraterrestrials being alarmed by the threat of warlike humans expanding into space with nuclear weapons . In contrast , it 's less easy to imagine a consortium of extraterrestrials resolving to exterminate humanity because of the threat we pose to other life on our own planet ; notwithstanding the rather brutal simplicity of that premise -LRB- which totally overlooks genuine if belated efforts at ecological responsibility on the part of human governments , organizations and individuals -RRB- , Klaatu posits that a world like the Earth is inherently valuable because of its biosphere , but I would think that Klaatu 's civilization - having mastery of biotechnology in particular - would be able to terraform all kinds of planets , reducing the treasured status of Earth as a haven of biological life . Also , the aliens ' view would seem to ignore the fact that evolution has given biological life remarkable ability to adapt to change , and there 's no particular reason to expect that the biosphere of Earth could n't repair itself even if we humans managed to wipe ourselves out . Combined with a conclusion to the film that is unsatisfying both logically and emotionally , I found the remake entirely disappointing . Other aspects of the film are also disappointing , such as blatant product placement exemplified by a gratuitous extended visit to McDonalds . Also , Gort was lame compared to the robot of the original ; I know the original Gort 's death ray may seem very old-fashioned but I was kind of looking forward to Gort doing some old-fashioned vaporizing . The main weapon actually used by the aliens - a cloud of nanobots which grew as it consumed material - is very plausible , but I found it odd that the nanobots so closely resembled terrestrial bugs when the film took pains otherwise to make it clear that Klaatu came from an exotic alien world unlike our own . Is there anything good about this film ? I suppose Jaden Smith was somewhat likable as the kid , and I felt he could have been very engaging if the script were better written . Also , the depiction of the starship as an orb full of swirling mysterious energies was neat as an attempt at depicting alien technology . And I suppose I kind of give the movie points for trying to reveal something about the origins of this particular Klaatu with an opening sequence set 80 years before the main story -LRB- although it is n't really very effective and just made a ponderous and boring movie that much more ponderous and boring -RRB- . Overall , aside from genre fans who are curious to see how this compares with the original , or very serious fans of Keanu Reeves or Jennifer Connelly , I would n't recommend this film to anyone .

" Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal they are n't ... . I took my 8 year old son to see this , figuring he 'd be into it much more than the original , which I feel is the classic Cold War science fiction film . My son hated the remake . I was bored too . Keanu Reeves in the lead was a mistake . And the obvious allegory to our alleged rape of the planet being at the center of the alien 's visit - it is sickening . This is less a remake of the 1951 classic than it is a remake of 04 's The Day After Tomorrow . Jennifer Connelly is again wasted . The kid actor is cute but can not act very well . Cleese is decent for the 3 minutes on-screen , but all in all , this film is forgotten by the time you get home from the theater . If you want halfway decent entertainment , go see it . But if you want to be moved by film on many different levels , stay home . Keanu Reeves is about as talented a leading man as Mason Reese . " ,3
" Only about one third of the film is actually worth watching . . The first third of this remake actually looked very promising . It all looked like a faithful translation of the original 's plot , characters and themes into a contemporary setting . With the original 's Cold War angst successfully replaced by modern-day fears about global warming and terrorism . The opening scenes ; Klaatu 's arrival , introduction and wounding , Gort 's menacing new look , the genuine sense of alien menace coming from our intrepid alien duo and their mysterious `` spacecraft '' . It all went together fantastically . But then ... they began fiddling with the plot too much . Suddenly , Klaatu is n't a messenger of peace and reason any more . Instead of his iconic lesson of humility which gave the original movie both much of its impact and its name , he now just wants to wipe us all out with swarming nanotechnology ... kill ... things ... After the first third , the movie also starts to descent into the tired old `` we 'll resolve our family problems while the world ends '' routine we 've already seen in far too many films . The character 's motivations and actions also become more and more awkward and even contradictory as the film progresses . At one point , Klaatu kills a police trooper , then brings him back to life , despite planning to destroy the entire human race . When asked about this , he mumbles something about `` not meaning the trooper any harm '' . Eh , what ? Apparently planning to kill off someone 's entire species does n't count as harming him ? Not really everything is bad though . As said , the first third is actually pretty good . And there are a few hidden gems here and there . The remade version of the chalkboard scene -LRB- a cameo for John Cleese -RRB- was actually genuinely touching . A few other redeeming points are the pretty decent acting characters , the good visual effects and the more spectacular action scenes -LRB- like swarms of microscopic killer bugs devouring an entire stadium in seconds -RRB- . These almost make the film worth watching . Almost . Overall though , I ca n't bring myself to think of this movie as a proper heir to the original . It is all the more disappointing because the opening looked so promising . At the end of the day , it 's just not a very good movie and not even worth it as just another sci-fi effects film . Both casual movie fans a devotees of the original version had better give it a miss . " ,4
" Sorry , Having a Black Kid was wrong . Having a black kid ruined the movie . All I kept saying was screw Hollywood and its PC social engineering . It totally distracted from the story and made me think what kind of screwed up people are making movies these days , and I voted for Obama so this is not racist , just fact . I liked the 1950 movie much better . The robot would have made a good monster , if it did n't turn into flies ! What 's up with that ? So if the flies eat things , how come it busted the hinges off the door ? Why not eat the door ? Now there is a big blooper . Also with the suit and skinny tie , all I thought of was the Matrix re-done . This movie was sloppy and no award winner . We will still be watching the 1050 's version while this one is in the junk heap . I like Will Smith , but his kid needs a good slap . This is one messed up kid . " ,1
" Good acting , shallow plot line \*\* SPOILERS \*\* . Keanu was perfect as the unemotional alien , no one else could have played that part better than him . Jennifer Connelly was also brilliant , but both were saddled with a lame plot line . Even the original had more suspense and depth than this remake . I thought the movie started out well and kept my interest until we get to the part where he has an immediate revelation and changes his `` destroy the humans to save the earth '' mindset to `` they have a good side ... so they are worth saving '' change of heart just by watching Jennifer hug her step son in the cemetery . Geesh , if we would have known it was that easy , she would have done that right at the beginning of the movie and saved us two hours of agony . And the ending was extremely disappointing . It 's like they got tired of making the movie and just ended it . My daughter came up with better endings for the movie on our ride back home after wards . The special effects were stimulating and convincing . But it seems like it was just a waste of time , money and energy for such a lame plot . Sorry to see such great actors in such a poor movie . I had high hopes ... " ,4
" Nowhere near as good . I was afraid of this movie after seeing the remake of ` The Manchurian Candidate '' Both the Manchurian candidate and TDTESS were always my favorite old movies . The themes and the scripts in both were politically and socially poignant , the acting was brilliant in both and the results were two fantastic movies . I 'll give the remakers of the Manchurian Candidate the benefit of the doubt and say that they made an honest effort to update the story to modern times but fell short of that goal with a bad script and sub par acting -LRB- while Denzell was good Meryl Streep 's performance of the mother was pale in comparison to Angela Lansbury completely chilling evil portray of the same character -RRB- . I was afraid that the other of my favorite movies was going to be warped out of recognition . Unfortunately my fears were realized in TDTESS . The parts i loved about the original were the themes and the conversation ... especially the conversations between Klaatu and the boy , not only teaching him about the universe but allaying the boys fears that were being broadcast across the media in reaction to the alien 's presence . I was a clear diatribe about fears of racism and the unknown . IN the remake there was nothing of this . While agree with Klaatu 's arguments that we are killing this planet and of the ultimate tragedy of existence if we let the planet die , this message was transmitting in 4 or 5 lines with very little effect . There was very little to this movie to like , the acting was sub-par . Keanu Reeves has more acting skill than was required for an emotionless alien of course , but it did not feel like it was well directed at all . There have been some successful remakes , but when you remake a classic it is important that the people who undertake the project is passionate enough about the original to do the project any justice . Its the same in music ; so make remakers are simply done because they have run out of their own ideas -LRB- or never had many to begin with -RRB- so they half-heartedly recycle stuff they think no one has heard of . Of course its is fortunate in this world that those of us who appreciate good effort can still enjoy the originals . Its not like Denzell 's and Keanu 's bad remakers have replaced the classic originals . " ,4
" The Day The Audience Stood Still . They can hardly call this a remake . No flying saucer , no Washington , DC , and no KLAATU BARADA NITKO ! Keanu Reeves was excellent as Klaatu , he should always take roles as an android , but everything that made Robert Wise 's 1951 movie a classic is missing from this version . It was more like mix of the Mummy and Starman . A bunch of metal beetles eating the world ? Klaatu using salve and energy from a car to heal a man ? Jennifer Connally gave a solid performance , but Jayden Smith left a lot to be desired . Picture Billy Gray tagging along after Michael Rennie , then Jayden Smith irritating Keanu Reeves , there 's just something missing here . And not to mention the special effects . You expect cheap looking special effects from 1951 , but not 2008 . Watching the 1951 version , I was hoping for a happy ending . Watching the 2008 version , I was just hoping for it to end . " ,3
" Worst Movie of Keanu Reeves . Unfortunately this is the worst movie of Keanu Reeves . . After Matrix series , he made wrong choices to act , and still continues . . About the movie . . Do n't go . . Give ticket money to a poor kid so the kid can buy hot meal . . It 's a waste of time Can anyone explain to me what is that big robot , with laser mono-eye . . Is it anti-Christ Can anyone explain to me what is the role of Keanu Reeves , is he a Saviour , is he a destroyer ... Especially one scene , the chat with a Chinese guy in a restaurant , so called `` the other alien '' , with funny language , bababa-klukul-yakhhale -LRB- like in the movie of gods must be crazy -RRB- what was that ... " ,1
" Not your father 's The Day the Earth Stood Still . Day The Earth Snored Still ... OK , basically , an alien and a super robot come to Earth and tell humans to either accept the kooky green agenda or die . That 's it . That 's the plot . No more . Nada . Of course you have snazzy CGI effects and the usual gang of walking clich s , but besides this , the movie either bores you to death or makes the Libertarian worth his -LRB- or her -RRB- salt angry at the implications that the Earth will be saved if we only ... I can not give away more , but you get the picture . The script was probably approved by Gore before it was given the OK to film . Disappointing , ridiculous , a waste of time . Rent the original - the anti-war message comes home better than the greenie , kooky , envirowacko message . " ,3
" Disappointing . As there seems to be a lot incomprehensible babble about the science fiction aspects of this movie or perhaps its accuracy to the original , I 'm here to merely comment on this movie 's lack of execution ... as a movie . Yes , I constantly question movies ' leaps of logic -LRB- why would all the scientists be at the landing site before the military cleared it for access ? hmm ? -RRB- , but that is for another thread . Instead , I 'll explain it very simply : This movie was not well written . \* Spoilers below \* The exposition ended up taking much too long -LRB- although I was at least interested in the movie throughout it -RRB- . This ended up leaving very little , in fact , no time to properly illustrate Klaatu 's motivation for his change of heart . The exchange between Klaatu and Barnhardt was stunted at best . This should have been the most important part of the movie . Instead we were left with too many scenes of horribly shot and horribly planned scenes of the GORT and Kathy Bates mailing it in . I know what I 'm getting with Keanu when I see a Keanu movie , but I was expecting a lot more from Jennifer Connelly -LRB- I do n't know why now that I think about it -RRB- . Jaden Smith was a pit stain on the cast -LRB- someone forgot to tell him in his `` acting classes '' that simply showing attitude every scene does not make one a good actor ... at least his dad finally learned that -RRB- . I was fine with the message -LRB- go misanthropy ! -RRB- and fine with the movie not having a ton of action . The action sequences seemed forced and extraneous even when they did show it -LRB- like some stupid studio exec expected that of all science fiction movies -RRB- . It really came down to the quality of the plot execution . I 'm more annoyed by the fact that I was bamboozled by the trailer . It gave the impression that this movie was going to be genuinely suspenseful and tragic . All that was found in the movie was a half-baked plot , a fizzled crescendo and absolutely no sign of any character evolution . " ,3
" Dreamcatcher Meets Meet The Press . Commandment 1 : Western women must be frequently and positively signified-wrong . This is the dirty tradition of the West which gives rise to the violence that this movie fails to address . Knowing the error in this assertion will sadly make us all be gay and forgotten by our families Commandment 2 : Middle-aged Matin e Mojo Moves Mini Movie Mogul . With respect to Jaden his character stole some oxygen here . Commandment 3 : Trading cigarettes for McDonalds does not a Maple Leaf buck bear . Just because no-one smokes does n't give a `` B '' actor as government bureaucrat the right to ask dumb questions while wearing D G frames . Nor does it allow News Corp to `` inform '' us we 're in New Jersey when clearly we 're not paying American wages . That said , comedy no matter how cheap would have been the risk for Hollywood-North to take here . An industry standard workhorse , camp humor would have been the recipe to right this boat . Not because camp humor is self-deprecating to homosexuals but as a clever retort to the real evil -LRB- those behind the recent failure of California 's '' Prop 8 -LRB- who I suspect could have shared their matrilineal power -RRB- . I 'm sure that the classy Jennifer Connelly was selling the aforementioned sentiment in her `` we can '' change theme , rather than the pimping of herself that her foreign academic co-star suggested -LRB- anti-UN , pro League of Nations -RRB- . I personally mean therefore that a character with intrigue and comic timing is needed . Specifically a conflicted , non-affiliated -LRB- read gay -RRB- male lead or second to Klaatu would have balanced the blind superwoman undercurrent and would have held the target audience . Case in point , Will Grace 's Sean MacFarland as a straight `` unachievable '' Klaatu would have nullified Cleese 's `` pimp '' statement and the overall `` bad -LRB- violent -RRB- male `` saw which only begs the `` egg before chicken '' counterpoint . The audience knows the roots of real evil and does n't need to be pandered to -LRB- pun intended -RRB- . This movie should have been Birdcage meets Mars Attacks instead of Dreamcatcher Catches Meet The Press . " ,3
" The day the Earth stood still . I will be sipping my coffee , reading paper , tweeting wait for the moment to pass !! I was so upset after watching the movie - `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' . there is this particular scene , where you can see the shadows of the trees moving at break neck speed , due to the light from the kind of alien space ship moving above them , but the humans who were standing close by did n't have an iota of shadows . what happened CGI\/animators forgot humans do have a shadow ? My expectations from the movie was quiet high , specially with title of the movie like that ! You need to see more of the calamity , as how the Earth will end , a little more inspiring protagonist or was he the antagonist ? he , Klaatu -LRB- played by Keanu Reeves -RRB- himself had the most confusing character , most robotic dialogues , and tried not to show any affection . Keanu and his character was a complete let down . At one point of time , he was here to protect the world and in an another sequence he wanted destroy mankind . oops , is n't that all the aliens do , regularly !! On the other hand , Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- played by Jennefir Connelley -RRB- has the only task of convincing the Keanu that human beings will change and they can live in harmony with other species and amongst themselves . Sometimes , he believes it , other times , he does not ! Oh my god , here i go again writing Yes and no , in the same sentence , but dear not-so-watchers of this movie , this is how the whole movie went . Dr. Helen Benson could have actually just seduced Klaatu and shown him the worldly pleasures that earthlings enjoy . She had to choose the easy of talking to him . Jaden Smith was the only character who was asking the questions , a whole of questions , and then with more questions and all these questions were becoming very annoying ! on top of that even the caramel popcorn that i was eating were very stale and had to throw them away and my this heightened my annoyance . Jaden Smith last i saw him in Pursuit of Happiness and he was really good as a child actor . When ever he said `` father '' in this movie , Will Smith would come to my mind . The storyline was quiet weak . Specially since when you have seen Independence Day , you are expectations keep on increasing !! You want to see something different , not some guy coming and telling you `` I am an alien '' in a hoarse voice , then saying , `` i have come to kill human beings . '' Ha ! ha ! ha ! The good thing in the movie is again reminding people that it is that each one of us will need to make difference towards global warming and living in harmony !! Till that time comes by , we will need to realize that we also need live in harmony and take care of other species , also . There are these two scenes one should not miss in the movie 1 . 40 ft trailer running on National Highway subliming into thin air 2 . The conversation between the Klaatu and the polygrapher . The look that Keanu Reeves gives on being asked , `` are you aware of an impending attack ... on Planet Earth '' . this is what was more desired in the movie . Please do not get fooled by the Taj Mahal in the posters , there is no Taj Mahal in the movie . " ,3
" hit and run kinda movie . i guess Keanu reeves never got over matrix , and so did n't many of us . i went into this film expecting a lot . You cant blame a guy for that , cause the trailers and the actors reputation was great . so what did i get . monotonous acting . some computer generated robot and really good sleep . after watching the movie i really wish those insects would have destroyed the world . that would be more fun than watching those idiots act so stupid . i was n't for a second drawn into the movie . its like a bad dream . and i wish i had read a review before going for it . please do n't make the same mistake . if you going to watch this move then please take a gun along . i got to go for 1 . the only thing that caught my attention was the graphics , but that shining ball also irritated me . " ,1
" Just a complete waste . First off , I do n't care if it 's a remake or an original , any movie should be able to stand on it 's own , no matter what the source . Second , I barely remember the original , but when I heard they were going to make a remake , I figured it might be a good idea , as the theme of humanity being on the verge of destroying their own planet could use an update . What I did have to endure , however , was 103 minutes of complete and utter crap . This movie does not work on any level . The message is that humanity is not worth living on a planet it does n't appreciate and even destroys bit by bit every day . -LRB- Not so novel -RRB- Point taken , yet when a handful of humans try to show Klaatu there is another , non-destructive side to us as well , they do it ... how ? By showing sympathy and affection ? Wait , the aliens have watched us `` for centuries '' , and this part escaped them ? What exactly have they been watching all those years ? And did n't their agent , who 's been living here for 70 years and does n't want to go back say exactly that ? And what did Klaatu do after hearing it ? Right , he ordered humanity to be obliterated . Then there 's Keanu Reeves . It 's easy to make fun of Keanu 's acting abilities , but this time around , I was genuinely surprised that he is apparently incapable of playing an alien , the thing he 's supposed to do best . Apparently he thought that impersonating Leonard Nimoy 's Mr. Spock would do the trick , but it does n't , it 's just terrible , and the best you could say is that it 's good for a few laughs . The special effects are surprisingly ineffective and just boring . And I 'm so tired about seeing yet another movie where the military launches some rockets against an alien spacecraft . Please take note : This will not work . Oh wait , here 's a thought : Maybe in the world TDTESS takes place in , there are no movies , that 's why the aliens do n't know about human feelings , that 's why the humans do n't know about alien invasions . I managed to avoid The Happening , and I was glad I did n't waste my time on it after reading the reviews . Now it turns out TDTESS is just as boring and silly . Avoid at all costs . " ,3
" This movie was FANTASTIC !!! Amazingly done !! . I do n't see why everyone thought this movie sucked so much . I , however , bought tickets on the day it came out -LRB- December 12 -RRB- . If anything , this was The Day A Great Movie Came Out . I loved this movie , and I plan to buy it on DVD . Keanu Reeves was brilliant ; he did an amazing job acting ! The CGI was n't too good , but the storyline made perfect sense . Although I was pretty disappointed that G.O.R.T. did n't play a major role ... In all , this movie was damn good , and I 'm glad I got to see it on it 's release day !! This is a 10\/10 film ... it deserves it !! Also , I was the only one in the audience that clapped at the end . This movie is a must see for all science-fiction fans !! " ,10
" Since when did big budget movies start to be crappy ? . Keanu Reeves plays an alien who has come to stop a pending attack on our universe in The Day the Earth Stood Still . This is yes another remake of the 1950 's original . Basically this is just the original only with color and more talented performers . Reeves plays Klattu , an alien who has been sent to Earth , to destroy the human race . To sum it up if the humans die the earth survives but if they survive the earth dies . Since humans have not been taking care of their planet , Klattu is sent to destroy it . He meets a doctor and a child on his visit who tries to get him to change his mind but by then it might be already too late . This remake starts off interesting , but soon becomes very crappy . The cast including the always terrific Jennifer Connelly -LRB- Blood Diamond -RRB- , Oscar Nominee Kathy Bates and Will Smith 's son Jaden Smith -LRB- who you might recognize from Pursuit of Happiness -RRB- are all well casted but even they ca n't save this movie . On the positive side , this does make you wonder if we are doing too much damage to the environment or not . All of that said , sadly this movie is pretty crappy . The characters were n't believable ; it 'll make you laugh when it 's supposed to be serious , and has action we 've seen in over a billion better sci-fi movies . I just could n't relate this movie , and that 's always a bad thing . However there are some near special effects and the performance from Jayden Smith actually saved me from giving this a 1\/10 . But apart from that save your money , save yourselves and do not go see The Day the Earth Stood Still . " ,2
" The Day Good Sci Fi Stood Still . Probably to go down as one of the weakest reinterpretations of a classic sci-fi film ever . Even with two great actresses -LRB- Jennifer Connelly and Kathy Bates -RRB- a well known decent actor -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- , and a whole slew of ` we-should-have-seen-more ' effects the movie can not escape it 's mediocre at best writing and it 's poor editing . It is a riveting concept , with engaging characters and alien presence but it just falls short and gets kind of jumbled and rushed in the end . As if all of those aspects were n't enough you have annoying little Jayden Smith 's character along the whole time . I 'll still stick with the original and probably think as if this new version never even come out . " ,4
" It looks good , and at certain times it even feels good ... but nevertheless so boring . . The Day the Earth Stood Still deserves praise for not being a typical catastrophe\/doomsday\/extra terrestrial movie , though this ai n't something you 'll notice right from the start ; because the movie opens up feeling like a mix between Armageddon\/Deep Impact and all alien-invasion movies for the last few decades . But as the movie starts running I noticed that they did n't use huge explosions , terrifying creatures or creepy set-pieces , instead they try developing Keanu Reeves ' character into a frightening thing of terror and the unknown , and Jennifer Connelly -LRB- which is an actress I 've always adored -RRB- has got this step-mum family-drama with her son going on . And basically , it 's those two that the movie focuses on , it 's very little to say about the supporting cast . The film stumbles early , the original elements of developing suspense through characters , unease and regrets-of-decisions-done are simply not good enough when the film just keeps promising and promising for something big , something exciting to come , and keeps letting me down . What 's up with that huge light-ball anyway ? And why did they have to set it in New York , AGAIN ? And has Keanu Reeves been sleeping in a fridge since the Matrix , returning here as carefree as possible to imagine ? It 's a remake and it adds new stuff to the older , aged material as making the whole deal into a moral issue of us humans treating the Earth badly , and therefor not deserving to live here , and blah-blah . It could have become a partly Gothic , partly frightening and fascinating take at the worn genre of the planet being under attacked by something so much more powerful than us - instead it becomes boring , slightly mindless and loosing momentum . Actually , if you look into it this is more like a family-drama between a already dead-father , a step-mum not understanding her son and vica verca , and Keanu Reeves psychologically helping them -LRB- Sort of like Dr. Phil -RRB- to understand each other , that there is that `` other side '' of human beings . " ,3
" Comically unrealistic military actions spoils this film . The writers spoiled any element of believability right from the start by not thinking through what the government might really do when faced by an imminent threat to the world . They start off OK by quickly gathering up the most important scientific minds in the country -LRB- to protect the interests of the US government -RRB- . That was a good start but then the story 's believability totally fell apart when writers had the Army immediately flew those same invaluable scientists directly to ground zero as soon as an alien globe-like object crashes into Central Park . Further , they then let the scientists walk unrestricted right up to the surface of the object . In reality , the absolute last thing the government or military would have done with those scientists would have been to immediately put them in harms way . They would have instead flew them out of the impact area as quickly as possible to a secure , protected location . Unfortunately , that unbelievability goes from bad to worse as the movie progresses . The next part where the military actions were apparently totally unresearched -- and unbelievable as a result -- was when the story had the Army flying `` Reaper '' Unmanned Aerial Vehicle -LRB- UAVs -RRB- to attack the alien globe . First , the Army would not have flown the Reapers , the Air Force would have done so . Second , and worst of all , was the way they depicted the Reaper UAVs flying . They depicted those aircraft as extremely maneuverable fighter aircraft with flame-shooting afterburner jet engines . In reality , Reapers are relatively delicate turboprop aircraft with limited handling characteristics . They are essentially powered gliders designed for high altitude reconnaissance aircraft , not highly maneuverable fighter aircraft . No afterburners either , just propellers . That may make for boring visual effects but realism is important when using present day machinery in a Science Fiction movie . If they wanted to use fighter jets , then they should have used fighter jets rather than create comically unrealistic fantasy versions of Reaper aircraft . Had it not been for the incredibly unrealistic depiction of government and military actions in this film , this could have been a much , much better movie . They took one of the best classic science fiction films of all time and simply squandered their remake opportunity by not doing their homework . Hire some expert advisors for god 's sake !! A little research would have gone a long way to make this movie a new classic rather than the special effects focused disaster that it is . The original version of this film will live on forever as a classic . This version , however , will be destined for obscurity shortly after it completes a short run through the video store circuit next spring . Too bad , this picture had so much potential ... " ,2
" The day the earth was bored ... . No , I have n't seen the original , nor do I care to after watching this boring and pointless excuse for entertainment . I bet the old one from 1951 had more suspense than this Hollywood garbage . Yes , the movie had a captivating start that left you with questions you wanted answered . Yes , Keanu plays a magnificent alien and his character is likable yet confusing at times because you 're expected to believe he 's bad , then good again , then bad . It leaves you wondering where the filmmakers were going with that transformation . A lot of people -LRB- myself included -RRB- probably thought this was a futuristic type earth-ridden disaster because the marketing showed the only action\/destruction scenes in the preview . Like Wall-E , it 's a wake-up call for humans to stop treating the earth bad , but in my opinion , Wall-E was crap and so was this . The only positives were Will Smith 's adorable son and Keanu . " ,4
" In one word ... `` Terrible '' . If you 've seen the original , which is a Sci-Fi gem and just as good to view today , then you will be absolutely disappointed with the remake . Why , when a formula for an original move is so successful and wonderful , someone would want to totally do away with it and create a whole new concept is without reason . I can understand updating a movie for the current age , but there is no need to make it into an altogether different concept . Keanu Reeves ... a Klaatu he is not . Gort ... no chills ran down my spine when I saw him . His role to me was meaningless . You will , after seeing this movie appreciate Michael Rennie as the original Klaatu , presenting a truly human perception to all that he sees instead of the cardboard personality of Reeves . Patricia Neal as the widowed Helen Benson presents a far deeper personal connection with Klaatu and the fate of the earth than does Jennifer Connelly . This is a movie that does n't warrant the price you 'd pay at a movie theater or as a rental when available for home viewing . Simply go out and rent the original or purchase it for your collection . Be thrilled instead of bored . " ,1
" Absolutely Disappointing . For a movie that was such a classic in 1951 , in a time when communication was so hard to come by especially for world leaders and the common public , in the time of radio glory and TV not having as many broadcasters as today , and produced by an empire of visual effects and owner of Fox News for example , let 's see a few points that probably went through the screenwriter 's head , or probably the producer 's zero to none creativity restraining the screen writing in what could have been an epic movie . 1 . - The president of the USA would have been one of the first characters that we would have been , it 's not 1951 , put simply with a fictional movie , ID4 , Bill Pullman doing some even not presidential things , added so much to the movie like the speech , however in this case , Kathy Bates is placed in a character that is neither there nor there , a servant to the president where they are treating the `` Greatest discovery of mankind '' . 2 . - The message . The 1951 movie was all about the message Klaatu was bringing to the world , and at the start even Gort was a lot more violent than what we see at first , simply desintegrating , literally all arms and potential dangers when Klaatu is shot . Now not only he is biological which was a good point , which `` seemed '' more threatening but there 's no payback , since this one simply stays still as they pull him underground and even lets itself be `` drilled '' . But back to the message , some parts of the movie were effective as what an arrogant race we are to think that we pose any obstacle to anyone who might arrive to earth with such technology , and does it even more magnificently so -LRB- no offense to the USA -RRB- by portraying Kathy Bates telling him about the President of the USA as if Klaatu should have heard of him , let alone of the way our planet works . However when they are to pass the message , in the meeting where Klaatu passes the epic `` We have created a race of robots ... '' speech , simply goes by as if the whole production crew , director , screenwriter and anyone forgot that was the point of the movie ! a Second chance but having showed they would make the earth stand still , instead they do it with these nanos which would have been better used if they did that to a couple of areas , then back to Gort , however Gort `` disappears '' when the nanos go flying out ! The earth stands still , and he leaves ... What message then ? What did the world learn ? which world leaders heeded to the message ? ID4 even had more success at this than this fiasco of a remake so promising from the trailers . And one last point , why giving such an annoying kid -LRB- which the actor is so badly chosen -RRB- such a preponderant role ? Seems that was the quirk they wanted to poise since in 1951 the kid was Klaatu 's friend from the beginning . Professor Barnhardt , who is a major figure in the original film only lasts a few minutes while they reach his place and the obnoxious kid calls the cop on him , I think Scott Derrickson had just seen X-Men 2 but has to realize that it takes a good director to pull an epic movie off , someone like Bryan Singer at least . " ,1
" I was so angry at the end of this movie . It was Al Gore on Steroids . It certainly was n't as entertaining as the 1950 's version . Keanu Reeves was blah . In the 1951 version , Michael Rennie was at least interesting as Klaatu . As soon as Reeves says , `` Your planet ? '' I think that 's what he said , I got a green flash . . and I was so right . The storyline made no sense . First he wants to meet with the leaders of the world , before saying why he was here , then he just decides `` We '' humans were vermin that had to be exterminated . So if he 'd already made that choice , why meet with world leaders ? So you can flip them the finger before eliminating them all , just to save the world ? In the original movie , Klaatu told the world leading scientists that he represented a kind of U.N. of planets and that if we did n't get a handle on our destructive nature with Nuclear Weapons , that this world would be eliminated . In this movie , no warning , no chances , just wipe us out . No real message , just that `` We '' are the problem and we must go . With their technology , Klaatu 's , they could have given easily the golden key to alternative fuels . Guess he did n't have a solution to that problem either . So the destruction starts . . around the world all power , oil , and essentials for human life on earth are destroyed , when Klaatu stops it all . Leaves the earth , and leaves the human race , who number in the billions , to starve slowly because you see . . we no longer have the ability to produce that which keeps us alive . Typical environmentalist crap . Stop now what your doing and the Earth will be resuscitated . Only problem is , pre-1900 's civilization was far dirtier , and far more pollution was created , than there is today . Now the earth and it 's population will now have to start plowing every available piece of land to grow crops that now have to be grown without tractors or fuel . Now we 'll be killing all the animals to just eat and survive . Wood and coal will be the way we heat our homes once again . OK , I see the point . . kinda . Badly written and thought out movie . Do n't waist your money on this one , and do n't waist one moment of your time watching it . Buy or rent the old movie . Was far more entertaining . " ,2
" Very disappointing . . . I went to see this movie with very high hopes because Keanu Reeves was playing a starring role like he has done since the Matrix but to be honest my hopes of a good film were shattered . I 'll credit the special effects , they were good , the story lacked certain explanations , the acting was good but there just were n't enough action . Let me just say when there was action it were for thirty to forty seconds then that 's it , it just suddenly stops at we 're back at the same old nothing happening scenario . In all I 'm very sorry to say that is film is n't one I 'll be buying in years to come , go and watch the original version I enjoyed that a hell of a lot more . " ,3
" Disappointingly stupid . . Not much to say about the film . Intelligent sci-fi is the last thing I expect from mainstream Hollywood these days and this pathetic excuse of a film is no exception . The 1951 version of this film was at least , original . Here we are loaded with stupid dialogues , utterly predictable plot twists and the regular dose of how self-destructive humans have superior family values than technologically advanced alien civilizations . And we have morals , people ... that if you throw litter in the park and screw the environment a giant alien ball will come from the sky to kick your ass . Keanu Reeves is so good at playing aliens , androids or the glum depressed mental . Here his Klaatu is very apt . Jennifer Connelly is a good versatile actress who deserves better lines and better roles . But what I understand is that she has to star in these movies once in a while to pay the bills . Jaden Smith and Kathy Bates are good as the cute kid and the tough defense minister respectively , but good performances only work well with good script , which sadly is missing . Even Gort , the giant robot , is so badly used in the film . The 1951 version at least had Gort as a very interesting element of the story . Oh and the 4 stars are for special visual and sound effects . Hollywood 's good at that . " ,4
" Annoying , Corny and Silly Remake of a Classic A Heresy ! . When a sphere from outer space lands in the Central Park in Manhattan , a group of scientists are summoned by the American government under the call of the Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson -LRB- Kathy Bates -RRB- . The reborn alien form Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- is brought to a military facility and Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- decides to help him to escape and becomes the only chance to save the mankind from destruction . The original 1951 The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the brightest science-fiction movies ever , with a very simple story and a wonderful message of peace . This annoying , corny and silly remake is a heresy and destroys everything good of the original movie , privileging the special effects and forgetting the essence of Robert Wise 's version how predatory the human race is . The arrogance of Kathy Bates 's character , Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson , reflects the diplomacy of the present days and is ridiculous . The awful Afro-American Jaden Smith is annoying and totally miscast as the unbearable and overbearing stepson of the gorgeous Caucasian Jennifer Connelly . Unfortunately there are many short-minded producers in Hollywood that insists in remaking and destroying classics and other great movies . In times of worldwide ecological concerns and intolerance and great special effects , the obscure director Scott Derrickson and the unknown writer David Scarpa lost the chance of making an updated remake exploring these themes . The excellent Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly have good performances wasted in this stupid version . My vote is three . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : O Dia em Que a Terra Parou -LRB- The Day the Earth Stood Still -RRB- " ,3
" Humans vs. Aliens . This is a pretty good movie about the Earth being invaded by aliens , who wanted to save Mother Earth by wiping out the human race . Klaatu , played by Keanu Reeves , is the alien messenger in human form and came to warn the people of the aliens ' sinister plan . Helen Benson , played by Jennifer Connelly , tries to persuade Klaatu that people can change for the better . The story plot is solid and the movie gets to the point right away , with no dragging and lagging subplots . I thought that this movie would get a little political but it fortunately dissuades from that method and basically sends a message to people that they have to take good care of the environment and stop the violence and corruption . Even though the human world could be a mess sometimes , Mr. Wu , played by James Hong , tells Klaatu that there is another side to humans : love and hope . So , it is through love and hope could people change for the better and I think this movie delivered that message well . With superb acting and a little comedy relief from the kid rounded up , this turned out to be a very enjoyable and exciting film . Grade : A " ,9
" Not Ready For Primetime . To say this movie is a disappointment is an understatement . The storyline is the same as the original , the SFX are obviously better , but there is little more action in this remake than in the original . The characters are one dimensional , -LRB- e.g. , John Cleese , whose character is the linchpin for human salvation , has at best a cameo -RRB- and the storyline has become laughable -LRB- e.g. , if NYC was about to be catastrophically leveled by a massive speeding object from space , an occurrence that experts say would be equivalent to a nuclear detonation resulting in global destruction , why would all of the world 's top scientists be circling Manhattan in helicopters just prior to the collision ? -RRB- . Do not waste your money . In this current anemic global economy , there are far better ways to spend $ 10 a person . " ,3
" It did not work , even after spending a ton of money on it . If you love good sci-fi this movie will be disappointing , it has two things going for it and they are not great but superior . The sound , and some of the special effects . I spent most of the day thinking about this and it just does not work as a whole . The leads are convincing and do a good job . The scenes are good , but do not fit together and tell a good story , the ending was not satisfying . At the end I just stared at the screen and wondered is that it ??? I had no choice I had to go , I rate the original as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made . The remake could of been so much more , they either did not care or lacked vision or maybe they did not understand that sci-fi fans are much more sophisticated and have higher expectations than the makers of this movie . I can not say this movie sinks , it is just mediocre and flat . I hope this crew does not remake anymore classic sci-fi movies , the classics deserve a better effort . I will avoid any movies directed or produced by these so called movie makers . I will not bother to buy the DVD . Go see it , if you must but you will agree afterwords that I told you so . " ,3
" The Day the Earth Stood Still Movie Review from The Massie Twins . Dr. Benson 's mission of convincing an alien from another universe to save Earth pales in comparison to the monumental task the film will have in appealing to audiences with an appreciation for story , character development , or the original 1951 movie . Focusing too heavily on the alien landing and subsequent military mishandling of the encounter , the brunt of the good doctor 's dire task happens in the blink of an eye with virtually no emotional involvement required by the viewer or the judgmental spaceman . The Day the Earth Stood Still probably wo n't make you believe the world is worth saving , but it certainly cements the notion that this film is n't . When a giant , otherworldly sphere lands in Manhattan , Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- and several other leading scientists are brought in to investigate . What they discover is the alien Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- and his gargantuan protector robot G.O.R.T. who have come to save the Earth by eradicating mankind . Now it is up to Helen to prove to Klaatu that the human species deserves one last chance The Day the Earth Stood Still is excruciatingly preachy -LRB- or perhaps just an inconvenient truth -RRB- with a message about saving the Earth from the violent and destructive nature of humans . It 's never more apparent than when shots are immediately fired at Klaatu 's alien entrance as he extends a welcoming hand to scientist Dr. Benson -LRB- we need a medic with alien surgery experience ! -RRB- . The military involvement is shown entirely in a negative light , working quickly to destroy the hulking GORT automaton and bring about a speedier global execution . It 's a good thing that an annoying , nagging child and his pouting mother are enough to demonstrate apt worth in an entire population and that alien invaders are easily convinced . Of all of the overlong films opening this season , The Day the Earth Stood Still could have actually used more time or at least better focused its minutes on developing characters and a story . The plot moves very quickly , but several scenes are wasted on showing off special effects that do n't add much to a laggard science fiction bore especially in this day and age when highly impressive CG is abundant . At least it 's understandable what director Scott Derrickson and his fellow filmmakers saw in the original that was in need of updating -LRB- debatably -RRB- a potential for computer graphics . And indeed the computer animation and picture quality is a sight more clean and impressive than the original , but there simply is n't room for improvement on the story or at least they could n't successfully locate any . Even G.O.R.T. could n't be adapted into something more appealing - essentially keeping with the original design , the looming robot did n't get upgraded in purpose or quality attributes over his predecessor . At least Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as an alien trying to act like a human , since we can assume he 's barely acting at all . - The Massie Twins " ,3
" This IS a great movie ! People are too hypocritical . . For someone who have never heard of the original , such as myself , I found this movie to be very entertaining . Having nothing to base this on , I find it creative , unexpected and the cinematography was superb . CGI creatives were convincing . A nice refreshing storyline that gives reason to what is happening , how and why it is happening . In my opinion , I find it to accurately portray how things may unfold in a real life scenario of events . Keanu is perfect for his role in this movie . As is Jennifer Connelly . My only gripe would be the kid . But more or less him as a character , not his acting . " ,10
" Yuk ... DO N'T take me to your leader . . What a waste of money . Keanu Reeves ' acting proved that , if he runs out of roles to play , he 'd still be able to do a great Mr. Spock in a future Trek film . Jennifer Connelly was equally bland and looked like a younger version of Demi Moore . And the CGI version of Gort LOOKED like CGI . The only reason I gave it three stars is because I wanted it to be so much better than it was - and got the feeling this film was n't so much bad acting as it was bad writing , bad direction , and bad FX . And I suspect that when veteran actors like Reeves and Connelly saw the theatrical version of the film , a part of them wanted to `` disown '' their participation . This film is scary in one other way . It makes me worry about other upcoming SF remakes - like `` Forbidden Planet , '' `` When Worlds Collide , '' and `` This Island Earth . '' This TDTESS remake really pales in comparison to the original . And I only hope the other SF remakes wo n't be able to prove the same thing . " ,3
" An opportunity Lost . I so wanted this film to be different from other remakes and be decent rendition of either the original 1951 film or the short story ` Farewell to the Master , ' but it was neither . Adding superior effects does not make a better movie because , ` The Day the Earth Stood Still , ' is a movie with a message and the message was lost in this hopeless remake . As humans we have to learn to understand our way out of problems rather than use violence to change hearts and minds and as we eventually reach other planets and stars other possible Alien races would see us as a terrible threat to peace . This film does ably illustrate this as the first reaction in the film is to shoot and bomb anything that moves and the military characters are flat idiotic caricatures . The Politicians are just as bad , they are badly drawn and unlike most ` real ' politicians have no concept of negotiation or bargaining that would be the case in the real world . The original film had the secretary of defense as an apologist for human immaturity and our propensity for violence . This film has violence on both Klaatu 's side and the human side and this displays the message that violence is necessary when it is not . Klaatu is a portrayed as a violent entity and a harbinger of destruction whereas in the original film violence in all its forms was abhorred and Gort was the ultimate weapon against this violence not Klaatu . The actors in this movie were unconvincing with no real empathy for the situation although to be fair the script is terrible with all characters being caricatures with no depth . The secretary is a caricature based on Condeleezza Rice who is known to be hawkish in her attitude is one example . This film fails to convince due to an awful script , poor acting and direction that loses the message that we as humans need to change before we destroy our environment and ourselves ; also that we will not be allowed to export our violent nature to other star systems . " ,2
" An Inferior Remake of Robert Wise 's Classic Cold War Parable . The landmark 1951 science fiction fable `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' concerned an extraterrestrial emissary named Klaatu -LRB- Michael Rennie of TV 's `` The Third Man '' -RRB- who came to Washington , D.C. , in a flying saucer to warn Earthlings that they must not `` apply atomic energy to spaceships that will create a threat to the peace and security of other planets . '' In the dreary , special effects laden remake , the intergalactic Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- shows up in a huge sphere in Manhattan 's Central Park to warn Earthlings that they have treated the planet with the same lack of respect that they treat each other and have done so much damage that they must be obliterated . Has n't Al Gore already said that without a spaceship and a monstrous robot ? Environmentalists will no doubt applaud the remake for its global warming message , but popcorn-minded audiences aching for thrills and chills galore may find this high-minded but heavy-handed remake bland to the bone . Mind you , `` Exorcism of Emily Rose '' director Scott Derrickson and `` Last Castle '' scenarist David Scrapa have loaded `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' remake with more action than its relatively tame predecessor , but this sci-fi saga generates little drama or suspense in what amounts to an anemic disaster movie . The 8 foot robot that accompanied Klaatu now stands 28 feet tall and he boasts another weapon in addition to his laser beam eyeballs . Pretty Jennifer Connelly gives the best performance , while Keanu Reeves remains as inarticulate as ever as the alien . He was a hundred times better in last year 's shoot 'em up `` Street Kings . '' Kathy Bates gives her best Hilary Clinton impersonation and dresses as tastefully as Sarah Palin . `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' springs no surprises with its ecological message . `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' contains a prologue that the original lacked . In 1928 , a lone mountain climber -LRB- Keanu Reeves of `` The Matrix '' -RRB- discovers a shimmering globe in the snow and touches it . When he awakens later from the shock that the object dealt him , he finds a hole has been burnt in his glove and a tiny patch of skin has been removed . The action fast forwards to the present as a military satellite detects an object streaking towards Earth with a crash point 78 minutes away in Manhattan . The government assembles an elite team of scientists to deal with the aftermath of this catastrophe since they can not prevent it . Ignorant government agents come banging on the door of Princeton astrobiologist professor Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Oscar winning Best Actress Jennifer Connelly of `` A Beautiful Mind '' -RRB- and hustle her off to a helicopter and flight to New York City . When Helen is n't teaching , she is a single mom to her adorably obnoxious African-American stepson Jacob -LRB- Jaden Smith of `` The Pursuit of Happiness '' -RRB- who has n't gotten over the death of his father in combat . Jacob sasses his mom , wears his hair in tassels , and hinders more than helps her later in the action . Anyway , everybody reacts with shock when the alien spacecraft touches down without turning New York City in a colossal crater . Like his classic predecessor , Klaatu emerges and a trigger-happy U.S. Army soldier pumps a slug into him just as he approaches Helen in a Hazmat outfit , splattering red alien blood on her mask . About that time , a gargantuan robot named Gort emerges from the sphere and emits a laser beam blast that turns all weapons into dust . Klaatu halts Gort from continued destruction and lets the authorities rush him to a top-secret surgical suite and a doctor digs out the bullet . He informs them all that an embryonic human is swaddled beneath layers of placenta . This human matures rapidly into Keanu Reeves , though the filmmakers neglect to bring up the 1928 mountain climber . Since the president and vice president have been evacuated to an undisclosed location , Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson -LRB- Kathy Bates of `` Primary Colors '' -RRB- greets Klaatu and refuses to turn him loose despite his having done nothing wrong . Instead , the scientists rush him off for a lie-detector test , but the resourceful Klaatu engineers an easy escape and hits the road with Helen . Jacob joins them and does everything he can to undermine Klaatu and Helen . Eventually , Helen takes Klaatu to meet Nobel Prize-winning Professor Barnhardt -LRB- John Cleese of `` Monty Python '' fame in a cameo -RRB- who received his accolades for biological altruism . The blackboard scene from the original is replicated , but Klaatu 's dialogue with Barnhardt focuses on the welfare of planet Earth not the escalating arms race . According to Klaatu , there is a shortage of planets for sustaining life and humans have devastated the Earth too such a degree that they must be wiped out . Barnhardt pleads with Klaatu for the future of humanity ; he argues that the brink of destruction will prompt humans to change their ways . Meanwhile , the military abduct Gort , imprison the robot in a silo , and try to cut through its impervious biological skin with a diamond drill . They fail miserably , but the 28 foot robot spawns the synthetic equivalent of locust and these bugs spread in clouds to destroy mankind and man-made structures . Okay , neither Robert Wise 's `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' nor Derrickson 's remake adhered to author Harry Bates 's original pulp short story `` Farewell to the Master . '' Of course , Wise 's `` Earth Stood Still '' served as a cautionary anti-Cold War tale about the paranoia of nuclear proliferation as well as an allegorical Christ tale . After all , Klaatu called himself Mr. Carpenter and rose from the dead . Derrickson 's spin has little in common aside from the bare bones basics of Edmund North 's screenplay . While `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' is new , this Keanu Reeves rehash is not an improved version of the timeless original . " ,1
" too preachy . I wanted to give this film zero stars for being so preachy . But I have to give it 4 stars for the excellent casting -LRB- Reeves , Connelly , Bates , Cleese , and others -RRB- , cool Gort , and overall good Hollywood production quality . I would 've given the movie an extra star if only they had found a way to fit `` klaatu berada nikto '' into the remake script . I can accept that the `` stop being mean to one another '' message of the original needed an update , but `` stop killing the planet '' was n't convincing . It made me think of `` The Arrival '' starting Charlie Sheen . -LRB- That film would n't play today , though , because it portrays global warming as not being humanity 's fault . -RRB- " ,4
" An effects laden re-imagining of the 1951 classic . . It has been over a year since I 've seen the original . I picked it up at a library while in exile in the woods Washington . And I liked it . I liked it as much as you can like a 1950 's movie with a cheesy robot that shoots lasers , and an alien who looks and talks just like a human . It 's a classic movie with a classic message . This movie is a suitable re-imagining of it . When I first saw the trailers , I 'll admit I had mixed feelings . Sure , aliens , special effects , Gort , special effects , spheres of death , special effects , special effects , and John Cleese . But , uh Yeah . I really do n't buy into this whole ` global warming ' thing that is such a popular money-maker right now . But really , there is no other way to remake this movie without throwing that in , especially now that the threat of nuclear war is so much less than what it was in the 1950 's . I walked out of the theater finding myself enjoying this production far more than I thought I would . Keanu Reeves just ca n't seem to shake the Jesus role , and here , he 's perfect . Klaatu is a cold , emotionless , robotic type who only loves the green earth that humanity is destroying . As he once stated , Keanu is portraying an inversed Klaatu . The original one was very human-like at the beginning , but then gave his speech about the threat humanity faces if they continued their violence . Here , he is an unloving being who slowly develops compassion toward his human companions . Jennifer Connelly is good as Helen , the astro-biologist and step-mother to Jacob , played by Jaden Smith . Jaden is a talented young actor , and he 's fun to watch most of the time . The few short scenes where it 's just him and Keanu are very , very good . Kathy Bates plays Regina Jackson , the United States Secretary of Defense , and her role was somewhat larger than I thought it would be . I was surprised at the relatively short amount of screen time that John Cleese got , which consisted of a short scene in which he pleads with Klaatu to spare the earth . I like John Cleese . This movie would have gotten one more star if he had had a bigger role . Ah , the special effects . Would it really be possible to remake an older movie these days without 'em ? 28-foot tall Gort looked amazing . His destructive capabilities which resemble a swarm of insects are a very cool effect . The space ships were a fresh re-imagining of the dated flying saucer that I 'm sure the non-inclusion of such will enrage many fan-boys out there . This movie does n't disappoint in the technical aspects . Surprisingly , I found myself at times agreeing with the sentiments in the film . It did n't focus mainly on global warming -LRB- although the shots of a smoke-shooting factory and pumpjacks shutting down were non-too-subtle -RRB- but on the inherent sinful , violent , and destructive nature of man . However , how the aliens chose to deal with this is a little drastic . What 's the point of keeping complex-life sustaining planet alive if the only intelligent species on it is dead ? Ah , well . Worth seeing if only for it 's popcorn-munching movie thriller value . " ,7
" The final warning - remake to fit todays threats . This remake of the 1951-classic with the same name , had to be immensely different , and so it is . This might obviously disappoint the followers of the great classic based upon the same manuscript . But no one today will understand the frights of war and atomic bombs as they were just after Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Todays main threat is the total misuse of Mother Earth . And the threat is the human species . What is then kept the same as in the original ? Not so much as this one will ruin watching the original . The main idea is kept - a warning , though it 's made more drastically . But the warning is not meant to be the same way as in the 1951-version . Here the destruction is already decided and is starting . Keanu Reeves is believable as an alien , and just as good as the original 57 years ago . The military is just as stupid . The big robot is of course bigger and more powerful and sophisticated . The technology is of course far more advanced . It had to be , when in the 1951-version it is nowadays quite outdated . The boy is more like he would be today . Spoilt , and pre-teenage angry , but still as irritating . The woman is of course not working in an office . So the main structures are all there . It has n't got the charm of the old version , but it 's got the seriousness in tenfolds . While the 1951-version has inspired lots of after-coming sci-fi films and later classics , we find threads of others in this new one . The touch of films like Contact , A.I. , but still this is quite different from what you have ever seen . The use of nano technology as the destructive force is well made , though not explained in any way , while eating away on structures of all kind . It is just as modern as it has to be to be a modern sci-fi movie of today . What is beautiful in this is the afterthought provoking feeling that man can change , we just have to be on the brink of destruction to understand . The last part has colors of adventure , and is the most beautiful part . I very much missed the music from the trailer , the music in the film seems of no importance . Sentimental music would have enhanced the feeling , and I 'd like it darker . But I guess this is the way it has to be coming from Hollywood . This film will be cherished by some and hated by others . It 's still a great idea , which they could have made much more out of . I think it will inspire new film with the use of nano technology . Will we soon see the filming of the late Michael Chrichtons book Prey ? Well this film wo n't be enough to scare us ruining the planet . The film as a medium has the power to do this , but no one dares go all the way ! I 'll be waiting for someone to dare ! So far The inconvenient truth is the best effort in scaring us to understand that this planet is not unbreakable . " ,7
" Hard to believe . Wow - what happened here ? Was looking forward to and was totally disappointed with this movie . Yes , I saw the original and yes I could n't help but compare the two , but even as a standalone , it was bad . For starters , what was that opening mountain scene in 1928 all about ? What were we to learn from that snowy place ? Now fast forward to present day . The first few minutes were interesting , but soon after the bottom of the barrel was in plain view . A few more observations . The Oriental fellow at McDonalds . He 's there , has a conversation with Klaatu in 2 languages no less and we learn that he 's been here for 70 years and wants to stay , knowing full well that impending doom is on its way . He did mention that he took a shine to us . One can only guess that he was on some sort of long term recon mission on earth , but why ? To what end ? Curious minds want to know . Now on to GORT for a moment . Oh yea , we , the earthlings named GORT , some acronym that was quickly forgotten . While GORT looked imposing and demos what it 's capable of , what happens ? He morphs into a mummy movie type swarm of tiny silvery bugs and as swarms do , starts reeking havoc - `` it has already begun '' . The professor Barnhardt scene was OK , but not enough to even remotely save this mess . Enough of this . If you 've read this far , do yourself a favor . Rent or Netflix the 1951 version . " ,3
" As empty as space and void of personality . . The undercurrent text may have altered since its birth by author Harry Bates -LRB- 1900 - 1981 -RRB- , from the 1940 short story Farewell to the Master , to the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still to its modern counterpart we see here today . In hindsight , i.e. human nature , we never seem to change , never seem to want to change , and it is the texture of this contemporary version that we see the same old message : change , adapt , live . But learn . Contemporary , that is the word . This re-mastering of the 1951 sci-fi parable of the warning of the destruction of the Earths peoples ' if they are to pursue their relevant course of existence is nothing more than an ego boost and highjacking by the controlling narcissistic superpower of the day . While not comparing the two films , in contrast , each stands on their own merits of intelligence and timeline factors . This supposedly being in a similar vain in tone comes close but still misses the mark . The human race has changed , or has it ? Possibly only in advancement of technology , the thinking of major leaders are parallel to the era of the early fifties ; mistrust of each other and control of its people , nothing changes . The message here is still relevant ; we must reap the seeds we have sown . It is with this distinct message that the human race must come to terms . This is where the film then falters , what may have turned out to be a global concern is then taken hostage by the obtuse governing power . While an important narrative overall , the people of earth are to be sacrificed for the survival of the planet Earth , we are then duly set upon by what can only deemed a mismatch of character development and loss of direction . From the beginning , this seemed to be a doomed episode of casting , the role of Kathy Bates -LRB- Regina Jackson -RRB- , as the Presidents envoy , seemed the equivalent of Old Mother Hubbard . Her staunch exterior and fashionable dress code would not have gone amiss if she were cast in a 1950 's St. Trinian 's episode . Dire , to say the least . Simply out of place and out of time , literally . Jaden Smith -LRB- Jacob Benson -RRB- is very quickly forgotten . While giving his character a major role in empathy , we are soon to learn that , some , children are best seen and not heard , an intrusion at best . It is this one-dimensional character based film , with the stereotypical Army staff , Governmental personal and a poorly mixed bag of assortments that gives a clich d development that both weakens the plot and its delivery . This too does not exclude the fact that the arrival of the most important science fiction character on the Big Screen being so blown to pieces and an exuberant anti-climax since Mr. Lucas decision to animate the Imperial stormtrooper . We now see Gort , updated and tagged with an acronym : Genetically Organized Robotic Technology made of rice papered CGI . Ludicrously too tall and distracting of any threat or believability , here , the adage `` less is more '' would have sufficed . Any imposing threat of this metal space giant is lost in translation due to its overbearing CGI pose and any impact of reality fading away all too quickly . Is there any respect for the classics any more ? Can not the two blend and find a happy medium ? A compromise ? We see here that it can not . Will not . The film also continues to sustain the message of necessary change and at the same time absorb itself in the vain reflection of the one country that this alien visitor has landed . Taking hold of current affairs , empathies and loss , mainly seen through the eyes of the young boy , this seems only too familiar with nationalistic prides than to project a narrative of worldly concerns . Maybe so , the young boy 's experiences ' here could well be a metaphor of how we have succumbed to this predicament of peril but at the same time it only furthers the vanity of a certain view point all too clearly . Unfortunately , here , in 2008 , we see a film that has adapted to its own times and events , with at best , banal television actors ' ruling the roost , a self-centred narrative , a disappointing metallic presence and the finale worthy of only a few seconds before closing time . A sad loss to the sci-fi genre . " ,2
" Highly underrated movie , not the best ever but still very much worth watching . Looking at all the terrible comments , this movie has been very low on my watch-list for a long time . But when I finally came to it , I was n't disappointed at all . Of course , there are some flaws - that 's acceptable in science fiction to a certain level . And anyway , do n't you think the US army would react very aggressively in real live when anything forcefully lands in their territory , earthly or extraterrestrial ? True , low expectations do make a movie better . But this movie was not really about an alien invasion or about the end of the world , it was about the way we treat ` our ' planet and the change that has to come in the way we do . Please do watch this movie , have some fun and be open-minded . And like any form of constructive and positive thinking : it does n't matter where it comes from .

" A good film ... but not as good as the original . THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL . It was good ... I have seen the original version and loved it ... so thought I would see what they have done with better effects . I actually prefer the original version , but this one is still good . It stars Keanu Reeves as the alien that comes down from space . It also stars Jennifer Connelly , Kathy Bates , Jaden Smith and John Cleese . I am not a big Keanu fan ... he has made some good films , but his acting is not that great . But he did OK in this one as he did n't have to do much acting as he was deadpan through the whole film . Everyone else did a good job . :-RRB- The effects were really good mostly ... I liked all the alien orbs , space ship thingys . I still do n't understand why most movies get remade , most of the time there is nothing wrong with the original version . But this remake is quite good ... Our planet is never safe ! I will give this film a 7 out of 10 . Another remake , but at least the original was not murdered .

" Wow , awful ! really ! . This is probably the worst sh \* t I 've ever seen in my life . But you may laugh listening the stupid alien giving us his dumb thoughts about life . It 's a real tour de force to do such a crappy thing with so much money !! Storyline Dr. Helen Benson is summoned to a military facility with several other scientists when an alien spacecraft of sorts arrives in New York City . Aboard is a human-like alien and a giant robot of immense size and power . The alien identifies himself as Klaatu and says he has come to save the Earth . The US military and political authorities see him as a threat however and decide to use so-called intensive interrogation techniques on him but Dr. Benson decides to facilitate his escape . When she learns exactly what he means when he says he is there to save the Earth , she tries to convince him to change his intentions . " ,1
" The Aliens tut-tut but the Humans pooh-pooh :--RRB- . It 's quite a compelling story of aliens only wanting to save Earth from the destructive nature of mankind , and in an attempt to do so , they alter the way we live . But is that for our good or do humans learn from the outcome by the end of the movie ? The movie gives no clear answer to such questions . Good special effects throughout . Keanu Reeves , Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith -LRB- as Jennifer 's step-son -RRB- do a fine job . Keanu did not have to emote considering the character he played . So his job was much easier :-RRB- Jaden Smith is a serious talent , and expresses beautifully . Hopefully , he 'll continue to go great guns as the years pass by . I was expecting more action , or at least the attacking sequences by the military jets could have been done better . That was disappointing . Verdict : I still appreciate the message of the movie . So , a thumbs up to that . Although , I 'm not sure if finally , mankind received it well ... " ,7
" Jaden Smith Ruined what could have been a good movie . I had high hopes for this movie and overall , it was a good Sci-Fi flick . Especially the robot and how it interacted with earths destruction . But for as good as it was , I was ready to throw something at the screen , anything would have done ! This is just another movie join bad , because of the child actor they placed in the film . Jaden Smith was simply HORRIBLE ! Towards the end , his So Called Acting was so unbelievable it stunk ! I just could not sit there and watch this kid destroy what was possibly a very good movie , I mean he just totally ruined it ! I mean his acting was bad enough , but what he did was something a normal , regular person simply would not do . So , if you have a chance to watch this movie , you will not be disappointed as long as you can mute Jaden Smith 's acting . Good Luck ! " ,1
" Spoiler -- Giant robot fails to take out 20th Century Fox ... pity . Went to see the Keanu Reeves version of The Day the Earth Stood Still , which was a big mistake . This has to be the worst movie made in the last ten years , and is simply awful . I 'd like to go through the DVD and document the hundred ways it 's bad , but why devote time to detailing the many reasons why compost attracts flies ? Here are two : In the beginning , a bunch of scientists are talking about how fast the UFO is traveling , and they say , It 's going 20 times 10 to the 6th kilometers per second . What rubbish . Scientists do n't speak scientific notation when the numbers are so commonly low . They 'd say , It 's going 20 million kilometers per second . Item two -- the robot -LRB- hilariously encased in a secure facility built underneath him overnight -RRB- is probed with a diamond drill . In real life a diamond drill is a drill bit with diamond dust glued to the cutting surface . This was a BIG DIAMOND , cut like a ring , spinning in what looked like a jackhammer . Bonus item # 3 -- apparently the entire movie is poorly-done CGI , like it was drawn by an art student who could n't afford all the colors , or a pencil sharpener . The original movie had a great premise -- mankind threatened other civilizations because we are violent and beginning to travel outside Earth 's orbit . This movie has a premise that is patently ridiculous -- we threaten Earth with our pollution , so the aliens will kill everything with nanobots , thereby destroying ... Earth . Presumably , evolution will start over . Since it 's starting from a different point , who 's to say it wo n't evolve into a Garden of Crud ? Only good thing about the new world ... this movie probably wo n't be in it . " ,3
" a failed encounter . Almost nothing works in this remake of a classical science-fiction movie in the 50s that brings to screen an encounter between civilizations which is failed on many respects . We may have seen too many films in the genre since then , or we may have gotten enough with ecological self-criticism in order to get too impressed with the idea of aliens coming neither to conquer the planet nor to abduct humans , but rather to save Earth FROM humans . It is not that the authors of the script and director Scott Derrickson gave too many chances for the idea to develop . There are too many coincidences and too many unexplained details for the story to have any trace of credibility . Why should the alien spaceship in Central Park of all places ? How is the introductory episode related to the rest of the film -LRB- excepting the big glowing sphere , of course -RRB- ? etc. , etc. , etc. , A lot of wasted talent is spilled on screen . Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly are fine actors , here they are obliged to give wooden performances and they are even prevented to build any chemistry between them which would have maybe given more interest to the story . Kathy Bates enjoys in this film the worst casting of her whole career . Special effects are less than average with one exception which is indeed worth being included in an anthology , but you can not save a film with one special effect . For most of its duration TDESS is on the brink of involuntary humor , luckily without crossing it . " ,3
" Annihilation , proudly sponsored by : McDonalds . . As with most remakes , I had very low expectations for this film . I anticipated your standard big special effects , a well-cast Keanu as an emotionless humanoid , and , at best , perhaps some creepy and \/ or imaginative diversions from the original - as in War of the Worlds . That would have been just fine with me . What I got , was 104 minutes that amounted to nothing . That 's 104 minutes of my life , gone , and I want them back . Keanu surprisingly contributed the most substance to this limp piece of work . Jennifer was OK . John Cleese , I love you , but where did you go ? The kid was mildly annoying but tolerable , considering the over-bearing faults of this film which left me yelling at the TV in a dumb-founded stupor ... To put it nicely -LRB- as I grit my teeth -RRB- , this movie feels like someone really wanted to take a classic and remake it into an environmental statement , and rightfully so . But then about halfway through , a corporate exec from McDonalds stands up and threatens to pull back the funding if they do n't make him feel less guilty about his career choice . So they had to edit out an hour or so of intelligent , substantial , and profoundly necessary content , if they still wanted the film to be released . So they hacked away at what could have made this movie watchable like it was a cow carcass on its way to Big Mac land . Perhaps this hypothetical edit was a mercy killing . One can only hope . Either way , it hurts . It hurts bad . I mean , the slap-in-the-face HYPOCRISY of discussing humanity 's inexcusable destruction to the planet in a MCDONALDS of all places , makes me physically ill . I am not even going to think about the wake of waste , the butchering , the crops , water and fuel - squandered , all over the globe ; or all that money that lines the walls of the golden effing arches . I mean , really ? REALLY ?! If that scene was supposed to have been ironic , why could n't they have made it a bit more obvious ? Why why why why why . Maybe it was a super hidden message . Maybe they were saying , Here . This is why the film goes nowhere . We are so so sorry . Alas , at first watching , it still looks , and stinks , like blatant corporate sponsorship - nothing more . I mean , the scene was n't even necessary to the plot -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- . The only possible thing that they could do to remedy this utterly depressing waste of time and resources , is if they made a pseudo-sequel , and really , REALLY stuck it to the man . Hard . I 'm sorry , this movie pains me in a way that no other has . Thank you for reading . I have to go cry now . " ,1
" Eh ... you get the point . As far as entertainment factor goes , I think this film did a decent job in retaining attention and arousing emotion to some extent . However , in analyzing the techniques used in direction and writing , I realize it might not be so perfect -LRB- as many other comments explain in further detail -RRB- . Regardless , I would like to commend the director , producers , actors and writers on the following : 1 -RRB- The effects were relatively believable as to not detract from the movie . 2 -RRB- If you had not known the actors from previous movies , characters such as Prof. Barnhardt would have been well portrayed . Viewers can see the intended contrast between government officials treating everything objectively , and the leaders , as Connelly put it , treat things subjectively . 3 -RRB- The use of Jacob Benson : he paralleled Klaatu and the alien intentions . First , he believed that Klaatu should be killed - but that was when he knew nothing about Klaatu and did n't realize how similar Klaatu and himself were . Then , after getting to know the alien and realizing that Klaatu had human traits , he began to support him . This reflects how Klaatu viewed the human race as the movie proceeded . " ,7
" Not bad , but not great . . I have n't seen the original 1950 's black and white movie that goes by the same name , but given all of the good reviews that the original received , I 'm sure that it must be really good.I went into the theater to see the remake with some low expectations because of all of the bad reviews that this movie received.I went with 4 friends , all of whom said it sucked.i disagree with them.I do n't understand why this movie is considered Razzie central.Sure , it 's not great , but it 's worth your time and money.I 'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeves , although I did love ` Speed ' . I think he did a good job as the center role in this movie , so there 's no reason to hate it . " ,7
" It 's watchable ! . This remake is n't the best one , but it 's got plenty of bright spots altogether . This movie got a cast to go on . Jennifer Connelly plays a doctor , Jaden Smith -LRB- Will and Jada 's son -RRB- plays the son of a dead soldier who wants him back desperately , Keannu Reeves plays the alien , Klaatu -LRB- Another name for one of Jabba the Hutt 's henchman in Star Wars : Return of the Jedi -RRB- who warns the humans about the destruction of the planet Earth . This mostly star quality than sci-fi quality . If anyone remember the original version , they can tell the difference . The one thing I liked about this version is when the swarm took out everything in its path . No regular pesticides can take them out . Meeting his Chinese counterpart at McDonald 's was a lot of fun . Plenty of great stars , lots of sponsors , not a lot of hoopla , this movie got a lot give for sci-fi fans . Will Smith is definitely proud of his son 's performance . Kathy Bates , John Cleese , and several others help make it big too . Moderately entertaining to say the least . 2.5 out of 5 stars ! " ,7
" What a Disappointment . Just this side of awful , there is no character development in this movie . I think movie makers are way too involved with FX . There was n't any real FX when the Rennie\/Neal version was made , so it was treated like a drama , not a shoot-em up sci-fi . It could have been on the level of Signs or War of the Worlds . As it is , it was just a bump up from a sci-fi channel made for TV movie . John Clese had a good scene , and Kathy Bates showed some chops , but I do n't know what Jennifer Connlley was doing . We all know Keanu plays wooden well , but the Smith boy was good and could have handled more . They should have kept the basic story line , amped it up with special effects and let it go . " ,2
" The first time was shocking , the second time painful . A few modest suggestions . I saw The Day the Earth Stood Still -LRB- TDTESS -RRB- -LRB- 2008 -RRB- twice , have read several user comments , and can not add anything new about how anticlimactic the new improved version was . I felt sorry for Keanu Reeves . Rather than complain about what was done , IMHO , I would submit my re-imaging suggestions of how I expected TDTESS should have been made to contrast what was lacking in the new version . Due to 1000 word limit plot\/sentences truncated . The Plot : In 1896 , a dying man in the Klondike 's is taken a by metallic sphere . Present day , an ovoid object comes towards Earth and circles the Earth several dozen times . The spaceship lands near the UN in daylight and is still for three days . Worldwide financial\/military\/civil panic ensues . Klaatu -LRB- Mr. 1896 -RRB- emerges saying I am Klaatu and come in peace and goodwill . Klaatu holds out a scroll like tube and is shot at by an insane man who screams about the end of the world . People start yelling gun ! Klaatu is shot by a soldier . Suddenly a large 7 ' Gort is now outside the spaceship . Gort disintegrates anything technological that is a danger to Klaatu . Gort ordered to stop and goes into a rigid stance . Klaatu says the scroll was a gift and is involuntarily taken to a hospital , heals within a day , and gives his salve to the doctors . The spaceship and Gort are impregnable and immovable . Klaatu is moved to Walter Reed . The Secretary of State offers the protection of the US to bring Klaatu 's message to a divided world . Klaatu says he must maintain impartial as Earth 's Klaatu -LRB- Earth 's defender to the Gort -LRB- Peace Enforcers -RRB- -RRB- . The Secretary of Defense comes for information on Gort and Klaatu explains the nature of Gort and for them to stay away from him . The SOD believes Gort is Klaatu 's master and they want to conquer the Earth . Disappointed , Klaatu changes his appearance and Gort creates Mr. Carpenter , -LRB- Mr.C -RRB- in all databases . Mr.C finds boarding offers for visiting scientists and leaves the hospital . Mr.C arrives at Dr. Helen Benson house , -LRB- War widow with a smart 13 year old son Bobby -RRB- . Fearful commentators are on the news and several nations demanding access to Klaatu and his technology -LRB- i.e. salve -RRB- . Klaatu 's escape kept secret but there is chaos in the Government . Mr.C on his off time has time to see the WDC sites with bobby . News of Klaatu 's escape , a picture of his old face , and reward announced . The world technology markets crash even more and nations become confrontational . The military aggressively study ways to safely destroy an immovable Gort and fails , in an act of frustration they encase Gort in Glastex . Gort orders smaller spheres to begin taking all species off the planet , just in case . A dedicated FBI man at Walter Reed figures out Mr.C does not exist on paper , only digitally . Mr.C and bobby are watching the news and says he is saddened that Earth lacks wise people . Bobby suggests Professor Barnhardt . Barnhardt is not home , but Mrs. Barnhardt asks them to wait . Mr.C corrects Barnhardt 's formula to pass the time . Barnhardt sees his changed formula -LRB- angry then awed -RRB- wants to speak to Mr.C alone to talk shop . Mr.C tells Barnhardt that he is Klaatu and needs Barnhardt 's help . If Klaatu fails to convince Gort that Earth is still savable , Gort will again deconstruct all of Earth 's technology for 300 years as was done 30,000 years ago when humans for the third time threatened the universe . To calm the chaos , Klaatu shuts down all but critical electrical power in the world for 30 minutes every hour for three days to calm the world and listen . Barnhardt says he will contact the world scientists\/thinkers to meet and hear Klaatu 's message . After the blackouts ends , the manhunt for Klaatu intensifies . Bobby tells Helen and Helen 's boyfriend Tom , stuff that proves Mr.C is different . When Tom later sees the updated picture of Mr.C -LRB- paper only -RRB- Tom tells the authorities for the reward . Mr.C goes to Helen 's workplace and admits he 's Klaatu , and then asks for her and bobby 's help and car to get to NY since authorities are watching for a single man . Klaatu changes his face again but authorities figure out how to find him . Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him , she must go to Gort and say , Klaatu barada nikto or Gort will inflict peace on humanity . When they are chased , Klaatu is shot dead . Gort dissolves the Glastex with nanomachines that spread slowly out eating just technology -LRB- metal\/bricks\/plastics -RRB- , leaving organic life\/materials behind . Authorities can not stop the nanomachines and it slowly dawns on authorities that in months they will all be cavemen . Gort shows up outside the building with Klaatu 's body , burns through walls to reach Klaatu , and leaves some nanomachines behind as good measure . Barnhardt gathers the prominent scientists\/thinkers of the world at the spaceship and thus prevents the military from nuking Gort . Helen arrives and gives Gort Klaatu 's message , the nanomachines halt , and Helen goes into the spaceship . Klaatu 's corpse is revived and addresses the assembled . The world is stunned when they all clearly hear Klaatu 's translated voice declare if this message is rejected , Earth and humans will be reverted to their natural state for 300 years . The professor pleads that humans can fix their problems . Klaatu is skeptical and explains why they created The Gort , peace enforcers given absolute power to squelch all aggression . Gort monitors the meeting 's progress and the entire world 's condition and all aggression has ceased . Gort informs Klaatu that the process will be halted , for now . Klaatu further warns that if Earth does not change their economic , ecologic , technologic ways to truly serve humanity then later attempt to extend their destructive chaotic ways into space , the Gort will return and there will be no pardon . The decision rests with you . Gort and Klaatu then enter the spaceship and depart at an incredible speed . " ,3
" The day rubbish fell to Earth . . One of the best examples in 2008 of how Hollywood is able to force garbage down the throats of moviegoers by utilizing big names . What was this movie supposed to prove ? That one can totally ruin a decent storyline by watering it down with total nonsense and not bothering to even make the events in it credible ? If Klaatu was an alien and can connect to machines , why the hell ca n't he get a car or a bike or a plane to fly him back to the park ? Or why ca n't he get the robot to come to him ? And if you want a human to pass off as an alien , at least get him to act like one . This is one of Keanu 's worst movies . A lot of his actions were right off the Matrix trilogies where he tried to act all stiff sometimes . Contrary to what most folks say , Will Smith 's kid did good because if you hate the little brat , that means he sure acted well enough as a little brat . ;-RRB- " ,3
" The day the kid ruined the movie ... . Why must they continue to put annoying children into sci-fi movies ??? Every time they try to add some street wise back talking kid with emotional problems it destroys every film their in . Is this entire movie about this dumb kid and his daddy issues ? Nowhere in real life -LRB- not that this film even attempted real life -RRB- would a 10 yr old kid be in control of the adults actions , why does n't she just leave him with a friend or neighbor while she goes to save the world ??? I was actually hoping that something disastrous would happen to him so we could get him off the screen . Jaden Smith may be the most annoying child actor I have seen in some time , daddy Smith has been trying to push this wooden puppet on us and it 's just not working , the kid acts like his crap does n't stink , but he sure does . Look at the publicity photos of him , he 's so special , wait 5 years when he 's a spoiled handful . Oh , and the movie itself ? Some of the worst film making in many a year , they took a great story and dumb it down so badly I could not wait for it to be over . Awful CGI , cardboard acting , stupid plot , and did I mention the kid ? " ,2
" The most annoying kid in this part of the galaxy . Oh Boy ! They were drunk or under the influence of something pretty strong when they decide to remake TDTEST . Let 's start with the positives , or rather THE positive , because there is only one bright spot in this film , and it is Jennifer Connelly . She is lovely as usual . Now , the rest . Oh , the rest ! Let 's start with Gort : Is that Gort ? I guess not , that thing is a classic example of EL CHEAPO CGI , I 've seen better things in Saturday mornings cartoons . Pretty lame ... Keannu Reeves as Klaatu ? Gim me a break ! That guy looks like a truck driver -LRB- no offense to truck drivers ! -RRB- he is so pedestrian ... He does not have the presence , the aura , the mystic of an alien being . The kid -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- . Is that a child ? No , not in my dictionary . I guess that living with a child like that 24\/7 will drive any parent to infanticide . Yuk ! The story : Where is the story ? This aberration looks like a road movie with the difference that they seem to be going nowhere . I could go on for pages ... Summarizing : They got a classic movie , mixed with political correctness , historical revisionism , bloated special-effects , ineffective actors and direction and got an easily forgettable piece of junk . " ,1
" Wasted hour and a half of your time . The whole movie could be summarised in two to three sentences . Spoiler forwards = Alien came to destroy us to prevent us from destroying the earth itself , and one alien -LRB- Keany Reeves -RRB- at the end of the movie came to realize that we are able to change in critical situations and saved us from dying . Fairly decent acting but not too many space for anything spectacular . I sure hoped for something more from Keany Reeves , but he did not delivered although it was not his own fault . And that would be the point of the movie . All in all ... ... not worth watching , better watch some stupid comedy instead as long as it is not some parody as scary movie or something from the same director . " ,1
" Just stunned . After watching the trailer to this with all the explosions and all the other cool looking effects , boy was i dead wrong . First of all i did n't watch the whole movie , i stop after the first 15 minutes of it , i could not take any more of it , it was like watching a very bad si-fi movie from the early eighties , the acting was like watching card board cut outs , the actors in this had a one dimensional feel to them , they where not very believable.So what i gather is that they where able to round up all the best in their fields -LRB- doctors , scientist and engineers -RRB- from one city thats what i got since they where in the same helicopter kind of unbelievable.Whats with the sound track once again it sound like from a cheesy 80 's si-fi . Do yourself a favor take your kid or niece , nephew to the zoo or chuck e cheese , instead of seeing this God forsaking trash . " ,1
" A Story Without a Plot . The original was impressive and still has merit today , so it is easy to see why a remake seemed so enticing . The trouble seems to have been one of maintaining a relevant and coherent plot . In the original the premise that our race was dangerous to ourselves and ultimately others made sense within the context of the story , but We , as a race , have moved on from that point and nuclear destruction is a less meaningful plot ; so the central premise has been changed to the environment and this is , I would posit , the downfall of this movie . That we inflict harm on our own planet is to the detriment of ourselves and the other creatures that share our planet , it in no way affects other civilisations . Even if one accepts Klaatu 's glib statement that there are very few worlds capable of supporting complex life , this is still not a reason for what Klaatu is planning to do . Time and evolution will take care of our suicidal short-sightedness and in the scheme of this planet we are as much a natural disaster as ` Snowball Earth ' , the end of the Dinosaurs or the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period . The film would have us believe that Klaatu is some sort of galactic creationist who believes that the damage we do is permanent and that there can be no further evolution or change . This is of course unsupportable and unbelievable even within the context of the movie . Micheal Rennie 's Klaatu was complex and multi-layered with a clear an moral raison d'etre ; Keanu Reeves ' Klaatu is almost robotically devoid of any complexity with an amoral ill-defined purpose - rather than being a messenger of hope and reason , he comes across as one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse . Whereas Micheal Rennie 's Klaatu could and did take the moral high-ground , in this version we have an amoral alien learning reason and morality from us . This ill-conceived turnabout removes any kind of purpose from the story : a story without a plot , as it were ! What we are left with is a shell of a movie : technically well crafted ; reasonable , when not cheesy , special effects ; good sound and occasionally very good photography . Without a plot the story can not sustain , the acting has no meaning and the experience is flat an uninvolving . I am left believing that the original was of its time and quite simply did not allow a contemporary remake . I have to conclude that it would have been better if this film had not been made . " ,4
" The Day the Earth Stood Still -LRB- 2008 -RRB- : A Review . . Here we are , with another questionable revamp of a classic film . This time the dubious honor goes to `` The Day the Earth Stood Still , '' the classic science fiction tale from 1951 directed by Robert Wise , of a space alien named Klaatu who visits Earth to warn against mankind 's ongoing hostilities , which stand to impact peaceful planets elsewhere . It 's a problem that can not be allowed to continue . The aliens , who long ago learned to maintain peace at home , would ensure that , so long as the human race is a threat to other planets , the very survival of people on their own planet would be jeopardized . In a small supporting gesture , the electricity that is so essential in driving life on Earth suddenly ceases to exist , and , although people remain alive , their way of life comes to a dead standstill throughout the globe . The original was made in the style of many B-movies of its era featuring the usual trappings : a flying saucer made of streamlined metal ; a huge metal robot with a slit that opens to reveal a destructive beam of light ; a mysterious alien ; chase sequences ; acting that is somewhat wooden . Despite the styles of the storyline and aesthetics , this film is considered more significant and relevant than such a status would imply , due to its call for harmony in a time shortly after the horrors of a real-life world war , a continuing cold war and threats of nuclear Armageddon . Ironically , if had not become such a classic , it probably would not have been remade . Fortunately , this year 's version directed by Scott Derrickson from a script by David Scarpa , which , in turn , was based on the 1951 screenplay by Edmund H. North avoids the scene-by-scene carbon-copying of some remakes . Less fortunately , it adds little of interest to the story and fills that void in the movie with special effects that , despite the potential for the immense detail , flexibility and intrigue today 's computer technology promises , come off as rather cold and empty . There are more sequences of action and suspense , but they mostly involve repetitious pursuits of Klaatu by the government and a desperate bid to save mankind from destruction that seems overextended to fill a running time that , at eleven minutes longer than the original , remains quite short but feels like an eternity . It 's almost as if the world is being wiped out in real-time . In short , this remake simply leaves audiences cold . " ,2
" Incredible ... . There are very few times I am left speechless , this is one of these moments . If there was an Oscar category for worst remake this would wipe out all competition , probably of all times . C Thomas Howell 's 2008 remake `` The Day the Earth Stopped '' was really , really awful without any exaggeration - the acting in his version is miles way better than this version , it is simply unbelievable . Hollywood seems set on not making films alike anymore , now they make films that already are made , and this really puts this decision in question . There are so much to complain about in this remake , in fact I can not think of a single thing that is good about it . And I really like the actors , otherwise , but this ... I am stunned , speechless . It makes Ang Lee 's `` The Hulk '' look like a masterpiece ... Pardon the french , but what a turd ... Avoid at all cost -LRB- I can not believe it was possible to give this advice for a film starring Jennifer `` Phenomena\/Rocketeer `` Requiem for a dream '' Connelly ... but please avoid - it might put your otherwise well-deserved reverence at doubt . I would actually pay money to have UNSEEN this movie ! \* I am dead serious \* \/ Choose death before viewing ... " ,1
" Dumber than a plank of wood . Great expectations must have accompanied this : wow , remake of one of the greatest ever , they could n't possibly ... Oh , could n't they ? This is a confusing mess , with so many loose ends they could start a loose end factory and still have a stock sale ... Awful lines and unintentionally funny , plus special effects that are n't in any way special ... All in all the one line review is : what a let down ! If you love Sci-Fi then sure , otherwise take two Tylenol and a friend who does and prepare for a great argument on its merits afterwards . If you 're still confused , so were we ... Only for fanboys , may I suggest ? " ,2
" Kid ruins film ... again . the idea behind the movie is nice , even though quite popular these days . but again a stupid little child ruins the whole movie just because it is a little brat and goes on everyones nerves . it seems to be common these days that in order to create tension , a person -LRB- usually a child or woman -RRB- is needed to act foolish and completely unrealistic . there are a lot of possibilities to save the movie along the way simply by letting the child stay with the neighbor , the military or the grandpa . another solution would have been just to give it a slap and tell him to zip it . additional things that regularly disturb me are the low quality of e.g. the fake snow in the beginning . it just does n't look real . something like that usually dampens my mood right at the beginning of a film . " ,4
" One of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my lifetime . Spoilers included ... One of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time , the 1951 version of Day the Earth Stood Still , needed a sequel more than a remake , especially if the remake had to be scripted by two untalented writers and directed by someone with less experience than such a highly anticipated film deserved . Keanu Reaves is not the reason this film failed , although I felt the alien should have been someone a little older . This film fell apart when the writers decided unnecessarily to make some kind of ethnicity tolerance point by forcing a black child into the role the lead female 's son . Wil Smith 's son is not as bad of an actor as this film makes him appear to be . The kid has some talent , but the script had him going from I hate this guy and do n't trust him , to I love this guy in the blink of an eye , with no legitimate reason for the sudden transformation . There are some decent CGI effects , but this film is not worth renting , or owning , or watching on cable . A complete disaster . " ,1
" The Earth Stood Still . This movie is horrendous ; it does not resemble the classic movie by Robert Wise in anyway . It is noisy and stupid . People believe they can remake a classic and make it better with noise , blood , and or sex better . They are wrong ! Too often the remake is horrible ; seldom it is better . The script was horrible , the CGI was worse , the acting was abysmal . Robert Wise made a classic science fiction movie that was intelligent ; they should have left it alone . I do not recommend this , I recommend the original classic science fiction movie directed by Robert Wise that starred Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal . This movie is far far better than the remake .

" Typical Hollywood . Another Hollywood political message movie -LRB- ala Day After Tomorrow -RRB- . The 1951 version , made during the Cold War era , also carried a message ... but for World Peace : humans needed to find a way to get along or be destroyed . This remake however , is a two-by-four over the head with several messages about human existence on this planet : industry is bad , technology is bad , vehicles are bad , cities are bad , etc , etc. . The military is depicted as bloodthirsty Neanderthals with guns , and the government leaders are the good guys holding out for diplomacy . -LRB- No role for a Pres or VP , likely because this film was made in the middle of the US presidential campaign ... Hollywood hedged it 's bets . -RRB- Do n't know what that annoying kid was supposed to do in this film other than showcase an interracial marriage . I liked the special effects though , but glad I got the DVD on sale and did n't waste money on movie tickets . " ,1
" OHHHH what a POINTLESS Remake ! . I could not find even one redeeming value to this film , nary a one ! The original was decent enough for its time , purpose and entertainment value , but this remake is completely pointless . The kid -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- who does n't have a clue throughout the entire film , miraculously garners the insight , nearing the finale , to correct an adult , a doctor no less , by enlightening her with his revelatory acumen , and then the ` doctor ' looks at him in awe , LOL , give me a break , even if he is the prodigy of award winning actors , LOL ... still , the film lacked any semblance of logic or continuity . In fact the only way this film would have made any sense is by an operatic , Allan Jones , solo then segue into the scene where Freedonia 's going to war with the Marx Brothers sans Zeppo , as that role was already filled aptly enough with the presence of Keanu Reeves . Jennifer Connelly was there as eye candy but the film fell short there as well . The John Cleese role was utterly pointless , unless he intended on calling on Brian to save the world , but then again , he was NOT the Messiah , after all , was he ? This film lacked any credibility and even less a connection to the original production , although The Giants really are seeking another venue ... two thumbs down and I am so relieved I waited for it to be shown on cable , in fact , I 'm seriously thinking of calling cable and requesting a refund for time wasted ... I honestly hoped it would have been better , I enjoyed watching the original , but that was then I guess ... " ,1
" Hand-wringing 60 's liberals need to get a clue . Who made this movie ? Greenpeace ? The original classic movie was about avoiding nuclear war , but that theme was very subdued . Subtlety is a lost art form in Hollywood these days . Instead , we are brutalized by the in your face theme of global warming and that we as a species are to stupid to live . You might enjoy this assault if your are from the chicken little-the sky is falling school of thought . As far as the acting goes , Reeves has the warmth of a hollow log , the military is made to look like idiots , and Kathy Bates does a very good hillary impersonation . Overall , a waste of time preaching movie . The special effects are crappy too . " ,1
" Great Story . When a science-fiction movie 's location is not space but is earth , also if there is an alien threat , it becomes a nightmare for most of the audiences . At least , I feel this way and I believe so . If you can focus on this movie carefully and if you have no idea about it before , you will enjoy it and you will scare a bit . Many of other critics did not fit my thoughts and I really liked to watch how earth stopped . Especially the ending message is good but could be better if editors would leave it longer . I think many of other fans will wait for it 's DVD to see the deleted scenes . Because somethings looks missing in this one . 7\/10 Give this one a chance and watch it . " ,7
" Terrible disappointment ... a travesty . . No , it was n't a slavish shot-by-shot remake or a sad `` re-imagining '' of a classic . They tried to update it for the 21st century . And it did start quite well ... some nice ideas about the nature of the aliens -LRB- the biological space suit etc -RRB- but about half-way through this movie went down the drain . What was wrong with it ? Biggest problem I have is this : these aliens have supposedly been watching us for a while , at least 70 years if the old guy who was a `` sleeper agent '' is to be believed . So how come they did n't know us very well ? Why did Klaatu let himself be convinced of our worth by some tears and hugs between Jennifer Jaden ? Oh , yes and some music by Bach . Pathetic . The aliens ' answer to our problem : genocide . Yes , that is very advanced . Well done . Let 's aspire to that level of advancement . The acting : no-one expects Mr Reeves to be anything more than an emotionless alien , but that obnoxious brat ca n't act either . If Daddy was n't a big name in Hollywood , Jaden Smith would not have got anywhere near the big screen . His hair is the most expressive thing about him . Jennifer Connelly is competent . Kathy Bates looks embarrassed . Runnng around in forests : no way to bring this film to a great ending . I was wishing for the end to come quickly and frankly , it got so bad I hoped the human race would be obliterated just so the cinema lights would come up . A good way to gauge a film is to observe the reaction of the audience as they leave . Today the audience dawdled out , no smiles , no discussion , no animation . This film had sucked out any enthusiasm we may have had . We were let down , deceived by the hype and genuinely disappointed . Do n't waste your time going to this travesty . " ,2
" The day this audience member was bored . . Let me start off by simply stating that if you have seen the trailers for this movie you have basically seen all the special effects shots this film has to offer . There is really no surprises to be found within the movie other than a rather strange twist involving the robot . The only thing you get to see that is not really shown in the trailers is the fact there is an annoying kid throughout this movie that really takes this film down a notch . As for the plot , it reminds me of an alien fugitive movie more than an alien invasion movie . The centerpiece of the movie , the robot Gort , is just about a no show which is a pity seeing as how his first appearance is the highlight of this film . It looks good and intimidating , and it only has a couple of scenes to show what it can do . Most of the movie is an alien visitor wishing to speak with the world leaders , but all us Americans want to do is fight a force that is clearly capable of wiping us out rather easily . Alien befriends mother and awful stepson to some extent and ponders whether to destroy us all or not . Granted there is more to it than that , but for the most part it is a talky , preachy and rather dull science fiction movie . Keanu Reeves makes the movie somewhat tolerable , however , most of the cast is not that good and the less said about the stepson 's performance the better ... hell , if that is what all Earth children are like then go ahead destroy us all ! A couple of special effects scenes are also impressive , but like I said nothing you have not seen if you have seen the trailers . I did like the swarm thing at the end though and thought that would have made a rather good movie by itself . " ,3
" Do n't write this movie off just yet . I did n't go to the movies to see this . Having heard all the bad press and reviews , I felt it was n't worth my 8-9 bucks . I did however , rent it when it hit my $ 1 DVD express machine . Going into this with an open mind I was very happy with the movie . I think that the biggest flaw with this film is what you will read in all the negative comments ... The Title . When you remake ANY movie classic , you have people drawing negative comparisons . This movie would have been much better received had it not been compared to the original . I would challenge critics of this film to go back and take a fresh view of the original . It is full of nonsense that at the time was acceptable . Overall , the story line , acting , effects -LRB- obviously -RRB- and feel of this movie is better than the original -LRB- if you do n't compare them as the same film -RRB- . Spoilers : I never read the original story , but I am guessing the remake is probably closer to it than the 51 version . The idea that Klaatu is here to save the earth at the cost of humans is great . The 1951 version was geared more to cold war anti communism . The flaws in the remake lie primarily in the GORT character -LRB- ? -RRB- . What was the purpose of the form of GORT , prior to destroying everything ? I know that in the original story you find out that GORT was in fact The Master . In the film , it is just a weapon . Also , the way the film was left hanging . It seems like it was missing maybe 5-10 minutes , to go into more detail on the ` price the earth had to pay ' . Again , if you are looking for a remake of the 51 film , you will be disappointed . However , if you watch this as an unrelated movie , you will enjoy it . " ,8
" A classic movie remake bombs . Yet again movie makers had a chance to make a great movie and relied on special effects and no story . This time the warning from space was stop destroying Earth by pollution killing off the other species we share the planet with . The first was do n't take war into space and to the rest of the species waiting for us there . But while we got the message in the first movie in this one it was clouded by a evil government not wanting to talk a bitter and disrespectful boy that would have been a better character in a gangster movie then this one with his kill them all hate them all talk . I did under stand the idea of the movie but this was a much much darker movie , thousands of people killed , and his message never delivered to any one who could do any thing with it . It reminded me more of `` Terminator 2 '' in that the terminator finally got what emotions were at the end when it was two late . I actually found I liked the C. Thomas Howell movie `` The Day The Earth Stopped '' to better in that it had a better story line . This could have been such a great movie but they went for special effect instead of a good story . " ,3
" ... mission purpose ... . I believe the major difference between the original and this release is the mission of Klaatu . The original sent him as a referee throwing a flag and demonstrating his ability to penalize humanity , if required . This new release appeared to be the implementation of that penalty on all humanity for refusing to change its ways over the last 50 years . Evidently , the population of earth in this movie never saw the original movie , yet the scientists appeared to know who he was ... many were more interested in Gort than in Klaatu , his planet , his form , his planet 's location , or his ability to traverse open space between our planets . -LRB- sigh -RRB- The script summarized our inability to change for want of a catastrophic event that threatens all humanity ... wherein lies the message to Klaatu and the others in his `` federation '' for humanity 's inability to change for global benefit . Our earth is just small enough for one natural catastrophe to effect other regions and nations , yet big enough to not have one regional calamity create equal levels of fear and serious concern in all regions and nations of the earth . Earthquakes on the west coast hold little threat to the regions in the Gulf of Mexico ... tornadoes in the American mid-west hold little threat to the northwest regions ... tidal waves in the Pacific have little impact on the daily routines in Florida . So , in the long run , until a threat becomes truly global in nature , humans see no reason to change ... and at that point of global destruction , almost any change we will `` all '' agree upon would probably be too late to avoid any tragedy that the threat will eventually bring to the planet . As for John Cleese , -LRB- Professor Barnhardt -RRB- , his presence and behavior demonstrated to Klaatu the ability of the human race to learn and adjust . Barnhardt did not object to Klaatu erasing his work and making changes - he was intrigued by the new approach and willing to argue with Klaatu as an equal to give humanity `` another second chance . '' The logic of the argument , and the incident in the graveyard both , helped Klaatu realize that humans are more than `` carbon-based units infecting '' earth that need to be eradicated . My final observation is the concept of transferring all the major creatures to the `` ark orbs '' before `` cleansing '' the planet . So , it appears that the `` swarm '' may not be able to differentiate between human and animal species ... or perhaps that fact does n't matter when a planet is selected for `` cleansing . '' I wonder what happened to them all once the orbs were ordered to leave the planet ? -LRB- grin -RRB- To those who despised the character of Jacob ... it is his superb acting skill that makes him that way ; the more you hate him , the more you should praise his acting . Klaatu was born human upon arrival , so his inability to handle his new extremities and emotional-response capabilities are completely understandable -LRB- to me anyhow -RRB- . Doc Benson disappointed me in her lack of curiosity about Klaatu , his planet , his ship , and his big robot , Gort . Evidently , she has seen the original movie . Gort disappointed on his waiting to implement his command directive until the movie was almost over ... -LRB- grin -RRB- It was puzzling that if he was sent to destroy , why not as soon as the creatures were in the `` ark orbs ? '' Overall , I do n't consider it a remake , more like an sequel of sorts . A few changes to increase the story without straying too far from the concept of the original . An 8\/10 from me . " ,7
" No Surprises in `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' . Keanu Reeves has the distinct gift for playing inhuman characters , hinting at an underlying humanity . In that sense Reeves is perfectly cast as alien Klaatu who comes to Earth delivering an ominous warning in Director Scott Derrickson 's `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' , an updated remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic . Keanu Reeves is really very good reprising the role made famous by Michael Rennie . His placid visage and calm make Klaatu amazingly sympathetic and compelling . Never having seen the entire 1951 classic , I understand that `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' has been updated from the Cold War cautionary tale to the green environmental warning of the world 's demise . In one sense Klaatu has been envisioned as an alien Al Gore . Scientist Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- pleads , `` We can change ! '' Klaatu cryptically concedes , `` The decision has already been made . '' Reeves and Connelly are very good here , and the CGI effects are occasionally stunning . However , the Third Act misses an emotional catharsis . David Scarpa 's screenplay adapted from Edmund H. North 's original screenplay does well in revising the Green theme , and fleshing out Dr. Benson -LRB- Connelly -RRB- as a single mom raising her stepson Jacob -LRB- Jaden Smith Will 's son -RRB- . Derrickson 's direction is very linear , and Scarpa 's story lacks provocative twists . `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' is solid movie making , but nothing about it is edgy or ambitious . As the movie opens , renowned astrobiologist Helen Benson is summoned to a secret government facility as a matter of grave national security . Her colleague Michael Granier -LRB- Jon Hamm -RRB- advises , `` Do n't be afraid . '' In this National State of Alert , Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson -LRB- pensive Kathy Bates -RRB- is in charge . Klaatu -LRB- Reeves -RRB- is being interrogated regarding a possible threat against Earth . Klaatu plainly says , `` You should really let me go . '' Obeying her own conscience Helen saves Klaatu from perceived harm . Klaatu is also accompanied by giant robot protector . Outwardly , they seem a viable threat to all of humanity . Helen is strangely drawn to Klaatu , and senses his evolving humanity . Klaatu has inhabited a human body from DNA strand premeditatedly taken years before . Seems the longer he remains in his human body , the more human he becomes . There is a humorous scene as Klaatu as corrects Nobel Laureate Prof. Barnhardt 's -LRB- breezy John Cleese -RRB- mathematical treatise . Although mankind has irresponsibly squandered Earth 's future , Helen must convince Klaatu that at heart mankind is good and can genuinely transform . Klaatu reminds Helen , `` If the Earth dies , you die . If you die , the Earth survives . '' The paradox is that Klaatu is the advanced being of great intellect and possesses amazing life giving powers ; however , his purpose is to annihilate all of mankind . Here Director Derrickson and writer Scarpa fail to leverage a narrative opportunity on the nature of man , and the possibility of humanity . Despite Reeves and Connelly 's efforts , the conclusion of `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' is disappointing , and way too safe . Nothing new is revealed . No surprises . Consequently , there may have been no need for `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' . " ,7
" Just forget it 's a remake and enjoy it for what it is . . Disclaimer : Since this is a review written by a 16-year-old girl -LRB- albeit one who has seen the original film , loved it , and plans to watch it again immediately after finishing this review -RRB- , no one is really expected to take it seriously\/read it at all . My theory ? Tolerable remake of a classic . But if you 're able to just forget everything you know about the original and just watch it for what it is , it 's a pretty great movie . It 's true that a lot of the original script 's elements were altered or removed completely , which resulted in the absence of many memorable scenes that made the original so lovable . That does not stop the film from being an interesting , modernized take on the story . Instead of the 1950s , when America was filled with extraterrestrial fascination and fear of technological warfare -LRB- Those crazy Russians ! -RRB- , it 's 2008 , and when the government detects an unidentified foreign object speeding towards Earth , it 's classified as a potentially destructive meteor , not a flying saucer scare . -LRB- Is it me , or does that sound a lot more realistic ? -RRB- Of course , when Helen Benson-a microbiologist in this version-and the rest of the government 's assembled team of scientists arrive at the potential impact scene , there 's no destructive impact . Just a spaceship . And this would be the perfect time for me to acknowledge one of a few elements of the film that stood out for me as opposed to the original : Nontraditionalism . What we see is n't the stereotypical , flying saucer shaped U.F.O that tends to show up in most alien movies . Descending from the sky is a huge , green , glowing iridescent sphere , that while it borders on beautiful , causes the characters to wonder `` What on -LRB- or beyond -RRB- earth could that be ? '' as opposed to `` ALIENS ! '' It really makes one think : Why do we assume that an alien spaceship would look exactly the way the human public expects it to ? Now on to the second element : Realism . Klaatu , in the original , was portrayed as almost completely human , outside of the fact that he 's , well , from outer space . He looked completely human , behaved as a human , and spoke English . Am I the only one who found that a bit odd ? Or was that basically the only way the public would view him as an intelligent life form ? In our more modern take , Klaatu emerges from the spaceship\/green orb looking somewhat human , yet somewhat extraterrestrial , and seems confused about the world he has landed on . In h is first few moments , he seems unable to speak English outside of repeating what he hears others say . Over the span of a few hours , he seems to develop into a completely human image , and the scientists examining him actually give an explanation for how this is possible . -LRB- I wo n't repeat it here ; I would n't want to spoil every last second of the film that I remember -RRB- When Klaatu finally awakens , his first spoken sentence is `` This body will take some getting used to . '' It may just be a fantasy story that is n't meant to be taken too seriously , but this seems a lot more reasonable than an alien who just happens to look human , would n't you agree ? -LRB- However , they still neglected to explain exactly how he learned English so quickly . As much as that irritates me , maybe it 's meant to be left a mystery . -RRB- BEST PART OF THE FILM : G.O.R.T. . As one of several dozen fictional characters that I harbor an unhealthy obsession with , I must give an honorable mention to 2008 's G.O.R.T , who deserves to go down as one of the most bad-ass characters in science fiction history . We all remember that classic character ; the chilling , humanoid robot Gort -LRB- I believe his name was not an acronym in the original , I may be wrong -RRB- who sent shivers down my spine whenever he prepared to vaporize any human who was trying to stand in his way . `` There 's no limit to what he could do . He could destroy the Earth . '' says Klaatu circa 1951 , which gives the character an even greater aura of mystique . But let 's face it . This fairly small robot may be a great threat to anyone who stands near it , but does he really seem believable as a global threat ? 2008 's G.O.R.T -LRB- Genetically Organized Robotic Technology -RRB- comes raging out of the spaceship as soon as one of the Army units fires his weapon . He is thirty feet tall and 20 times the size of the average human being . He deflects missiles fired at him with his eyes , and seizes complete control of aircrafts that attempt to fly near him , crashing them into the ground in a violent explosion . When the government finally captures the robot and attempts to examine him , it is revealed that he is actually comprised of centillions of insect-like nanobots that can immediately eat through glass , metal , and preferably the flesh of unsuspecting humans . Let 's face it , G.O.R.T was probably a much more horrifying threat to the world than Gort . It 's a shame he got about 5 minutes of screen time throughout the whole movie . WORST PART OF THE FILM : Now this really did annoy me . Where on Earth -LRB- or beyond it -RRB- was `` Klaatu Barada Nikto '' ? I may not have many qualms about script-changing , but how could they cut out the defining line in the film that 's known in almost every household to this day ? Unbelievable , but thankfully it did n't ruin the film for me completely . My overall grade : 7.5 \/ 10 , although watching this film right after the trailers for both Knowing and 2012 kind of caused an irrational fear of a soon-to-come Armageddon . I 'll get over it , hopefully . " ,7
" OK but could have been much better . GORT rules . . Well I liked the kid . I think he played quite all right . U see he was a kid mourning the death of his father in a sulky , passive aggressive way , until his blockade broke in the cemetery scene . It was all facade until then . Keanu : wooden as usual , must be the most overrated star in Hollywood , that dude really can not act , I think even Schwartzi is better and Stallone much a better actor than Keanu . But that inability was OK here , as he portrayed an alien devoid of emotions . Must admit that all the scenes with GORT impressed me , there was something about that thing , it is enormous and menacing , and they played the right kind of music , the entire cinema was quiet during those scenes . The actress used to be hot and beautiful , she is now one of those too-thin actresses , so dry almost anorexic . Too bad . The script had several weaknesses , they gather a small group of scientists but then only she is allowed near the alien , the alien says the plan was put in motion and nothing can stop it yet then he does stop it . Why ?? Just because the kid and the woman showed emotions he realizes `` there is another side to u '' ? Daa , how banal , if those aliens were so clever and much more advanced would n't they have had infiltrated human world much earlier and found all there is to find ? Sort of like the aliens in `` The 3rd rock from the Sun '' did -LRB- in a much more funny , poignant and intelligent manner than here -RRB- ? And what exactly did the alien witness to change his mind ? I saw almost nothing there , at least nothing to justify a change of a sophisticated plan to wipe out an entire race from an entire planet . That was simplistic and disappointing . But interesting was to see how the film tries to include various elements of the biblical myths into the story : locust , the God 's wrath at the human race , the figure of a Godsend Savior who inhabits human flesh and can resurrect the dead ... I liked Kathy Bates ' portrayal of a US politician who thinks that problems might be solved by force and who dresses in a horrible way like Hillary Clinton or Barbra Bush . But I did not get these moments : when the alien is tested by a polygraph and destroys the interviewer , would n't there be many cameras in the room to see what was happening ? When the alien is getting through the locust towards the mother sphere would n't his human casket get totally destroyed in a moment ? We saw the locust eat up even metal parts before ... " ,7
" Overall , the acting is good the effects are great . I would think that this movie should have authenticated the US Chain-of-Command a bit better . There are valuable lessons to be learned from this movie about who we are as a human race . Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly played their part very well , but I would expect that from a very famous actor actress . Kathy Bates annoyed the heck out of me , but that is not from bad acting , rather that seemed to be her role in the movie . She has been a super-star in other films . I think Jaden Smith will be a great actor if he continues to develop and hone his skill in the film industry , but I am not sure this was the best fit for this type of movie . I am probably being over analytical , so I gave it a good 8-out-of-10 . " ,8
" Blockbuster . . Why do they do it ? Why do they take a modest classic like the 1951 The Day the Earth Stood Still and turn it into a hypermanic attempt at an epic by draining it of all its original phantasmic charm and replacing it with action and cheap emotion ? The question is rhetorical . They do it for the money . This monstrosity must have cost the budget of the black-and-white original to the power of 10 . It 's vast and full of ghoulish colors . The sound makes one 's house pulsate with the rhythm of doom . The acting resembles no human behavior that we 've ever witnessed . It 's hard to think of a reason to go on with a review . I mean , how do you review a compost heap ? Well , in the original , Klaatu -LRB- Michael Rennie -RRB- walks out of his flying-saucer space ship and is shot in the shoulder . He 's taken to a hospital and , once removed from his space suit , is entirely human . Here Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves , who has shown himself capable of almost reaching the levels of animation of an animatronic figure in Disneyland 's Hall of Presidents -RRB- emerges from his monster-sized medicine ball of a space ship as a glowing light source . When he 's shot and taken to the hospital , he must shed his outer layer of organic material before he resembles a human being . The shedding is accompanied by all sorts of gooey scraps of rubber and the sounds of a bowl of molasses being stirred with a wooden paddle . Eww ! , scream the enthralled ten-year olds , although even they by now must be a little sickened by the clich s. In the original , Rennie came to warn the earth to shape up or they 'd be shipped out . Here , Reeves comes to destroy the earth because they 're already screwing it up . This gives the producers of this grotesque piece of offal an excuse to show us magnificent scenes of destruction -- the big stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands collapses and so forth -- before Reeves relents and realizes humans deserve another chance . There are , naturally , more subtle moments of fright . A couple of approaching lights in the night sky suddenly produce ear-splitting roars and destructive winds . They turn out to be helicopters -- straight out of a scene in Close Encounters of the Third Kind . Well , why not ? Gort the robot is still along , but only for the ride . In the original , the outsized , metallic , tubular Gort possessed superhuman technical powers , while Klaatu was merely human in all respects . Here , Gort is no longer the size of a tall man . He 's the colossus of Rhodes . And he 's not tubular . He 's built like a super hero in a comic book , bulging with human muscles . His latissimus dorsi would be the envy of Arnold Schwarzenegger at his most robust . The question of why a robot needs all his muscles in hominoid shape is never addressed . But in any case , Gort is irrelevant because Klaatu no longer needs him to do the heavy lifting . Klaatu has acquired all sorts of supernatural powers himself . I do n't mean just technological powers but supernatural ones . He can bend men 's minds to his will at a distance . He is clairvoyant , in that he knows that Jennifer Connolly is carrying a certain item . He even knows which pocket it 's in . He can manipulate the current in an electrical circuit . He can bring the dead back to life . All of this leaves poor Gort dangling pleonastically in the breeze . The writing and direction are almost indescribably expectable . The camera can hardly hold still for a moment . -LRB- Neither does the earth get a chance to stand still , rendering the title pointless . -RRB- During an otherwise static scene it wobbles frantically as if eager to get back on the move before those ten-year olds begin to yawn . The shots are conveniently divided into two categories : -LRB- 1 -RRB- gigantic close ups of worried or horrified faces ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- long shots of prodigious catastrophes . There are some improvements over the original . The kid is more believable here than there . And the exchange between Klaatu and the Professor makes at least as much sense here , although John Cleese , good as he is , is not Sam Jaffe . Instead of remaking successful movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still , why do n't they remake failures and try to improve them ? Klaatu ? KLAATU ? Where are you when we need you ? " ,2
" Where was the script ? . The cover to the DVD had the words ` The special effects are out of this world ! ' which sums the film up . Since cgi became cost effective and usable on second rate films - the effects have become more important than the rest of the production . More important that is , to the studios - not the viewer . From the start of the film it misses the plot . The main character -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- is totally devoid of any dimension . It seems she has only one purpose in existence , and that 's to be a part of this film i.e. she is unbelievable . Again we have to have an annoying young brat that is shoehorned into the story line to try and pull things together - only this time worst than usual . The opening sequence should really serve as a warning - as the scientists are brought together , and flown to the impact point , it all seems entirely forgettable . Something just does n't click - there is no chemistry . The action is there , but who cares ? This was n't a bad film , there are worst . But that does not excuse this production . Fortunately , I got the DVD at a bargain price , so I do n't feel too cheated . Pity those who paid top dollar at the pictures . Only watch if you have to . " ,3
" A decent remake that could 've been better . The Day ... starts out well enough and has some good thoughtful ideas , but ultimately loses at the end after its innovations gets chipped away , leaving only derivative formula . The Day ... is faithful in many ways to the original , except that Klaatu does n't really have a message for Earthlings . We are considered a planetwide pest that must be removed so that Earth may live . Thus it is reasonable that Klaatu is n't very talkative or in for chats with the gov ' t types sent to check him out , generally being rude hosts to the spacefarer . With that setting I think the movie plays out fairly well , but there 's problems . I did n't care for Benson 's stepson ; compared to the perky kid from the original , his role as a brat drags the movie down . Bates ' Sec ' y of Defense and her minions are typical Hollywood gov ` t. goons and get zero for distinctiveness , but they do move the story along in more or less the same way the Army idiots did in the '51 movie . The biggest disappointment is GORT . GORT is great as he 's originally introduced , and continues to represent the ultimate menace very well , until he does n't . Then GORT gets Hollywoodized with flashy CGI stuff and is no longer GORT as we all know and love but a sort of nanobot locust swarm . The filmmakers seemed to know that the original GORT was cool , and his nanobot structure was a neat idea , but evidently they ca n't resist their addiction to CGI and mess him up . Bad decision . The Day The Earth Stood Still is required viewing for sci-fi geeks and it is best seen immediately before or after watching the original . I like both but the original still rules . " ,8
" Entertaining and Thought Provoking . I do n't know how I missed this movie in 2008 . I have suffered some real rubbish movies of late -LRB- circa 2009 -RRB- , but like books , once started I have to finish , no matter how bad they are . Now I 've read a lot of criticism about the 2009 version of ` The Day The Earth Stood Still ' , but I have to admit the story and the message elevated me above being immediately critical about the various less-than-worthy aspects of the movie that have been justifiably raised by other critics . I watched it for what it was meant to be , pure entertainment , 100 minutes of my life I could well afford and donated gladly . It re-kindled many thoughts in my mind that have been lounging around for some time now . Right from the start of the movie when the alien gets shot I wanted the aliens to win , -LRB- am I the only one ? -RRB- such is my growing disgust for all things human on this planet . Rightly so , the movie measures us against all the other life forms that inhabit Earth , giving as much credence to their right to live as to ours . It 's a fact that dinosaurs roamed this planet for a period of time 600 times longer than Homo Sapiens has been in the driving seat , our tenancy is in its infancy by comparison and yet most human beings think they are what the planet was waiting for . I really wanted the aliens to succeed with their sanitization of the planet , for some time I have thought how nice it would be to clear this great planet earth of human beings and let it revert to better times . Basil Fawlty -LRB- AKA Prof. Jacob Barnhardt -RRB- was wrong , the aliens were right . Nations that have atomic bombs call them ` deterrents ' , nations that do n't but aspire to having them are said to desire ` weapons of mass destruction ' , for me they are the ultimate cleansing agent just like the black bugs in the movie . Wow , such uproar , no doubt myriads of itchy fingers reaching for keyboards to vent their wrath upon my words in some kind of proxy revenge . Do n't bother , the fact that you even think about doing it is proof positive of the perniciousness of the human mind . This movie , while not perfect at least goes a long way in pointing a finger at the culprits , humankind , the scourge of this earth . I 'm not a ` green ' or an activist , just an observer becoming more ashamed by the day of being human . But human beings are what they are , despicable self appointed ` super beings ' that think they 're the ultimate life form created in the image of equally pernicious gods that direct them in the guise of a thousand religions to kill , maim , swindle , rob and generally cause harm to each other and every other living thing . Our desperate search for life on other planets is merely our desire to extend the reach of our lust for other life forms to exploit or kill . More or less everything on this Earth has been here since the beginning of everything , as the alien Klaatu said in one throw-away line in the movie , ' ... the universe is not wasteful it 's all recycled ' . For me it 's definitely time for the human race to move over , the quicker it is recycled the better . And finally suck on this ; in a billion years time man will be long gone , but the atoms we 're all made of right now will still be here , but not in their current configuration , thank those gods . A very entertaining and thought provoking movie that gets 7 out of 10 stars from me . " ,8
" Am I the Only One Who Likes This ? . When most people declare movies utter crap , I tend to say they are great films -LRB- with the exception of Meet the Spartans Ugh ! -RRB- . This is not an exception . I read so many negative , biased reviews about this film . I rate this movie in its own , not comparing it to the original from fifty years ago . This film is about a scientist who get called in by the gov ' t because weird things are happening . A giant orb has landed in Central Park . Now they have to stop Klaatu from making the Orb destroy Earth . The acting is decent . I have always known Keanu Reeves to be somewhat of a good actor . Connelly also surprised me here . Jaden Smith does need to work on his acting skills . The visual effects were OK . They were the not the best except for maybe in one or two scenes . Overall , this is a really good sci-fi film . I rate this movie 9\/10 . " ,9
" Good film ! . Watched this , last night , with my girlfriend . Had been putting it off due to all the negative reviews here and , consequently , I was n't expecting much . However , I have to say this is a good film ! I 've not seen the original and have never read the book , which maybe why I enjoyed the movie . If you 've never read the book and providing you 're not a huge fan of the original , you 'll probably like this movie . It 's not ground-breaking and it 's not going to go down in the annals of cinema as one of the all-time greatest Sci-Fi movies , but it 's a lot better than some of the dross I 've watched lately and an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours .

" The Day the Earth Stood Still and so did I. . This comment will contain a few spoilers . First off , lets start with what this movie is about . It 's a remake from the famous and fantastic film that was made in 1951 . Does the remake live up to the original ? Not a chance ! This movie had me wondering what I was even watching and the main problem is a poor written script and terrible acting . Though the thing that got to me most was the horrid plot holes . I do n't think I 've experienced that many silly and stupid plot holes in a movie ever . Lets mention a few . The beginning of the movie , when we see Klaatu or whoever he was at the beginning first seeing the sphere . What was the point of that ? Why show us something that makes no sense at all without giving us some information . The scientists . Helen studies fossils or something , so why is SHE so important to have if an asteroid is heading towards earth . I did n't get why she was so important ? When they first have contact the alien\/Klatuu at the time reaches out his hand . This is a sign of peace . In this movie the military just gun him down like they always do , clich . Klatuu then gets rushed to a hospital or something and we see him being born into a human . After some minutes the Secretary of Defense walks in . She wants to ask him some questions and boy they are stupid . As the Americans already know , is that the aliens have a hell lot more power than them , though that does n't seem to stop miss `` America rocks the entire world with weapons and bombs '' . Her character is so flat and so dumb that even a five year old kid would n't be convinced . It appears in this film that America is the world ? I hate watching movies where every other single country is just some trash , and America is the ruler of the world ? Why is this ? . And of course , the only thing America can answer with is a war crazy general that just wants to bomb and do damage to the alien sphere . Clich . Klatuu tells Helen why they are here . Exterminating the human race because they are ruining earth . Alright , good point indeed . Though love saved the day one more time . Because Klatuu got convinced by Jennifer Connely 's bad acting so fast that it did n't make sense at all . Though the biggest tragic in the whole movie is the spoiled little kid . Why is he there ? What is his purpose ? I got so annoyed in every scene that kid was . And the way it was planned just tells another thing about this garbage of a script . All in all the acting was pretty horrid . None of the characters were believable and did not have a connection to anyone . Reeve 's almost looked like a lifeless robot . But the biggest mistake was Kathy Bates . Why did you do this movie ? You did not fit in the role at all , and it made the entire movie look cheesy as hell . All in all this movie was horrid . So many plot holes and bad script writing that you could take a bath in it . If you add the bad acting and over-dramatic visual effects you ca n't even imagine how bad this is to the original . Use your money to watch another film , because this was a waste of life ! " ,2
" Klaatu Is Not Very Observant . Too bad for this film that its audience is paying more attention than Klaatu . I have not seen the original , so my comments about this remake are based entirely on its own merit -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- . Other reviewers have already pointed out the horrible clich s and the untenable script , so I will say only that the reviewers are generally correct , but the overall score of 5.6 -LRB- as of today -RRB- is actually too generous . ... SPOILER ... The single biggest problem with this movie , aside from the myriad other issues , is that if Klaatu had been paying attention to the human race , he would have observed that millions of human beings throughout history have displayed remarkable altruism and have sacrificed themselves to far greater extents than Connelly 's character does for Smith -LRB- and vice versa -RRB- . If Smith and Connelly 's love is enough to convince Klaatu to spare the human race , then he obviously was not paying attention when -LRB- insert notable act of selfless altruism here -RRB- . Thus , Klaatu 's epiphany makes absolutely no sense and is the final nail in this terrible movie 's coffin . ... End of spoiler ... I give this horror flick a 3.5 \/ 10 = F " ,3
" I was expecting a little better than this gave . . I was expecting a little better than this gave . When remaking a cult classic from the 50 's , you have to either do it well or preferably not at all.Keanu would have been better suited playing a cameo as Neo or at least Gort he was that lifeless ! The film was full of special effects , more than the average film I would say , except maybe The Matrix . However they were almost wasted in the wish , wash , all over the place script . Jumping from scene location to scene location , I almost felt like I wanted to go back and see what happens next in the other scene . Summary then is as follows . If you really are a special effects lover then maybe this will attract you , mainly for explosions and not much else , they were pretty basic . If you are a sci-fi fan , it will more likely attract you , but even then there was n't much to it . Yes Gort looked cool but it felt like he did less this time round . Maybe that was due to the rest of the films rub off affect . Who knows . " ,4
" OutRight Ridiculous . . I never got the chance to watch the movie in a theater , but I am pretty glad that I did n't . First off , the only good thing about the movie was the acting . It was fairly textbook quality and the characters did display what was expected of them . But the direction was a complete failure . The story line at the beginning was even worse . The happenings in the movie -LRB- the `` cleared highway , the Madame Secretary-The Stereotype Bitch , The collection of professionals , and such -RRB- made me feel i was in fact watching a cartoon where anything can happen . I would give the originality of the movie a -5 . . Yeah . . a minus five . . Thats how awful it is . Renting this movie would be the best way to go . The 1951 move was fairly decent for its age . Remaking that to better graphics in modern day community where expectations are very high as the final nail in the coffin . " ,3
" decent sci fi movie . this updated remake of the classic original ; day the earth stood still -LRB- 1951 -RRB- is not as bad as people were saying it was , its pretty well done . although i 'm not a fan of Keanu Reeves as an actor , but he does a capable job as klatuu.gort the giant robot should 've been shown more in the movie but nevertheless is very menacing and convincing.Jennifer Connolly plays the Patricia Neal part , lets say updated for the new version.Haden Smith -LRB- son of Will and Jada Smith -RRB- plays her stepson.and John Cleese -LRB- Monty python , fish called Wanda -RRB- plays the Sam Jaffe part.and also on hand is Kathy Bates as the presidents defense secretary.i would say she is pretty much the baddie in the film.great character actor ; James Hong has a small role in the film.i think this version is very well done but it will never top the 1951 original , much like all the king Kong remakes failed to do.the cg effects were not overdone like most movies of this type.the plot is basically the same but some things are different.when i first heard of this remake , i was thinking not again.Hollywood seems to have run out of fresh ideas.whats next a remake of the godfather?twin peaks?you 'll never know.i really enjoyed day the earth stood still.although its not a great movie , but its pretty good.I 'm going to give it 7 out of 10 . as for Keanu Reeves performance not bad , sort of like his matrix films.if you hav ` nt seen the original one i recommend it , its a sci fi classic .

" Bad Film . Tips for everyone thinking of buying -LRB- when its released -RRB- or seeing this film : Avoid at all costs . This film is nothing close to Good Sci-Fi\/Disaster movie and a mockery of what one of this genre is supposed to be like . O.K I mean , I 'll admit the first 20 minutes or so are pretty good and pretty intriguing it sort of leaves you wondering whats going to happen next but thats it for decency , after Klaatu and his big friend come out of that sphere its just conversation , after conversation , after pathetic action sequence -LRB- involving a man falling off a chair -RRB- after conversation . Utterly , utterly boring remembering its supposed to be A Sci-Fi\/Disaster movie ! as far as I know good disaster movies do n't involve wittering on and on for two and something hours about F \*\* K all . Utterly pointless and terrible film please do not make the mistake I made , avoid this film worst six quid I ever spent . " ,2
" crap , weak , useless . Man , so much potential to make a great film , and this is almost as worse as Al Gore and the Inconceivable Truth . How a politician garners more attention in a black Cadillac espousing what scientists have forewarned for decades is beyond me . Just more evidence that the world just values idiots that know nothing . This movie almost follows the same vain . When will and do people change ? How does Jennifer meekly say this twice , like a tape recorder , as if it has meaning ? How do people bulls % # the world for so long and then say on the brink of treating the world like rubbish , WE will change ? It makes me feel so stupid . The original movie said the same thing , in a much more poignant fashion , 50 years ago . Has the human race ` changed ' ? We just make films to convince people that people will change , so we wait for someone to make the first step and just go along with it when the time comes . Nice ; very intelligent . Idiots . Has anyone not realized that progression -LRB- of intellect , at least -RRB- is slowing down ? That the human race is doing its best to slow the present economic system to avoid its inevitable destruction ? And then what ? Oh , right : ` Wo n't happen in my lifetime , so why should I care ? ' If we have a different side , why the hell does it not win out in making decisions based on cohesion to build product and services that do not waste so much resources and that VALUE THE EARTH . Economics first until the 11th hour , and then get Al Gore to save the world . What happened to the Gandhi 's and King 's of this world ? And why do such people have to use so much energy to convince those with so much fear , and yet , who are in power ? How did George Bush and Mao Zedong get to ` rule ' countries if we have a different side ? And then , a film like this uses the fundamental aspect of the earth standing still as an afterthought before the main sphere takes off . How did that happen ? A powerless film for powerless people .

" Gort , Klaatu berada nicto . Almost missed those memorable words . Keanu Reeves was good as the alien but it is a pity that the rest of the film went nowhere . The remake has color and cgi effects , but lacks any real charm . The kid is an absolute irritating smart so and so -LRB- and should have been terminated -RRB- . It seems to be the trend with remakes that the original is so much better , eg The Wicker Man with Edward Woodward vs Nicholas Cage . Gort , that robot that can destroy worlds is kidnapped !! Are you serious ? Sadly yes . Gort is an acronym ... ... really , it just takes away from the whole vibe of the original . As for the actions of the military ... ... . no comment necessary . I also almost missed the earth standing still ; that scene could have been omitted from the film , but hold on , they would then have to find a title for the film . Wanted it be be good , but such a disappointment . " ,2
" The movie is not that bad . I read the reviews from those disheartened viewers who were expecting the same or beyond the quality of the original one . all of them have written the comparisons with the 1951 classic.I did not see the original one and may be that is why this movie was n't that bad for me.movies like ` transformers ' ` the day after tomorrow ' were more disappointing than this and they did n't get battered like this one.i have n't come across any intelligent criticism from any one other than blind comparison , and hate for the movie . may be for not raising to the level of the old classic . a good sharp script would have made this movie better.the dark eerie ambiance was effective.and the movie is n't over burdened with special effects.but this movie surely do n't deserve this kind of hate and rage .

" Rich in contemporary and relevant social criticism despite the regurgitating an apocalypse narrative . This film was rich in contemporary and relevant social criticism despite the regurgitating an apocalypse narrative and re-hashing Keanu Reeves as another prophetic savior . Even the ditsy , airhead Bill and Ted managed save the world . Yet , unlike most films within the apocalyptic sci-fi genre - the set of films , comics , etc. that assume humanity almost destroys itself before realizing any greater -LRB- public -RRB- good - this film 's alien has no intention of destroying the earth - humanity is already well on the job ! Prejudice and polarization are the greatest threats to democracy . America is highly polarized , threatening to re-order the world in its wake . This is the backdrop of this film and , critically , increasingly the evening news . Naturally , the aliens land in Manhattan . Yet rather than seeing `` the city '' focus as typical American chauvinism - it 's true and exhausting that MOST Hollywood films take place in either New York or LA - this film ran the Jesus narrative to a tee ! Many believe that Prophets only descend when and where there is total moral decrepitude . In fact , a devout , practicing Muslim friend from Mali once explained to me that this explains why there had been no African equivalents of Jesus or Muhammad . No better place to represent humanity 's worst than where so many global narratives of hate converge : The Twin Towers and Wall Street ! It is now clear that greed , anger and stupidity enabled both the construction and destruction of these such icons . The film was unrelenting in its critique of humanity 's arrogance in assuming that we 're alone in the universe , the presumption that the planet belongs to us , and the supposition of dominance\/sub-ordinance in any and all inter-cultural encounters . This critique was maintained throughout the film , yet came to a head with plenty poignant points of dialogue : `` Do you speak for the entire human race ? '' The alien Klaatu , portrayed by Reeves , asks the US Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson . She replies : `` I represent the President of the United States . '' Luckily , realizing that not all viewers would see the sheer arrogance and truthfulness of this response , the director played to the peanut gallery and caste Kathy Bates in the role . She was certainly Miserable ! This film was a critical commentary on cultural imperialism and chauvinism , challenging humanity to refocus on what bids us rather than divides because this allows us to reconcile despite any conflict . Exactly like the latest Harry Potter , Spiderman and Batman flics , the conflict posed in the Day the Earth Stood Still , i.e. humanity 's destruction , is resolved through reconciliation - the two main characters agree to forgive themselves and one another , thereby causing Keanu Reeves\/The One\/Jesus , to save us . This time the Obama narrative was unmistakable . Like the little boy who thought that Keanu should have been killed , by the end , the little tanned bi-racial haired boy is the greatest advocate for tolerance and understanding in order to save us all .

" A crappy remake of an excellent movie . The Day the Earth Stood Still -LRB- 1951 -RRB- is one of my favorite movies , not only by its own merit , but also because of the context in which it was made.In the first decade of the post-war , with the North American economy on its explosive development and on its road on being the biggest potency in the world , the movie proposed the valid idea that the supremacy of power over the rest of the world was not the correct road to follow and that every military or ideological expansion should be carefully controlled by the science and the morality.Now , the crappy remake of that extraordinary movie , uses the ecologic movement in a painfully unambitious way.Even without making any comparisons with the original film , The Day the Earth Stood Still -LRB- 2008 -RRB- is a very bad film.With only two other movies on his filmography -LRB- the pathetic Hellraiser : Inferno and the brilliant The Exorcism of Emily Rose -RRB- , director Scott Derrickson was completely inappropriate for a movie like this , which aspires to have an epic tone , but which does not produce even the minimum level of suspense or emotion.As many other catastrophic movies , this movie pretends to tell , on a parallel way , two stories : a big conflict which makes uncertain the future of the humanity ; and the emotional journey of some characters.But this movie is so poorly written that it produces a big boredom on both aspects.Jennifer Connelly has made good performances on other movies but not in here.Keanu Reeves is appropriately cold on his character and I honestly do not know if it was for his talent or the lack of it.But the worst member of the cast is Jaden Smith , who is irritating when he should be sympathetic , and forced when his character needs honesty.I think the best member of the cast is John Cleese , who shows he has not only talent for comedy , but also for serious roles.Believe me : I did not hate The Day the Earth Stood Still for being a poor re-interpretation of one of my favorite movies , but because it is bad by itself.The screenplay is full of inconsistencies , there are a lot of scenes very badly filmed and I did not have even the minimum level of tension and suspense.Come on , this film is bad even if we only take it as a Hollywood blockbuster and nothing else.I do not recommend this crappy and enormously boring remake.Instead , try to see the original film . " ,4
" A fair cop . Ah yes , another remake . But before you pull out the old stake and flames , allow me to try and sway your mind on this one.Okay , given , the original is considered a classic . A milestone in sci-fi entertainment . But it is by no means untouchable , or as so many laud it to be , a masterpiece by any rights . And this update is probably less cheese - ridden than its 1951 source material . I mean let 's face it : everyone has seen a sci-fi film from the '50s and they are n't exactly the best that the wide world of cinema has to offer . In the '60s Kubrick topped everything with 2001 : A Space Odyssey ; the '70s belonged to Close Encounters and Star Wars ; the '80s saw Blade Runner , The Fly , Predator and Terminator ; while the '90s offered Terminator II : Judgment Day , Starship Troopers , Event Horizon , eXistenZ and of course The Matrix ; and the ' 00s gave us Sunshine , Transformers , Children Of Men , Casshern , Minority Report , A Scanner Darkly , Signs and even last year 's I Am Legend to fill our palate . All the while , the Alien franchise ran through the last four decades . So in light of this , a little touch up on a now out of date concept is forgivable . Especially since those damn Ruskies are n't threatening us any more . The plot sees a group of strange spherical objects coming to Earth , one which is Keanu Reeves ' Klaatu 's ride into town , and the ensuing awe and wonder-slash-panic they induce thereafter . Upon interrogation he informs the people of Earth of an impending attack . But this is no classic alien invasion . Unlike War Of The Worlds , or Independence Day , they do n't just turn up and start frying folk . No , good Klaatu gives the people a reason for it . In the original it was because of the hostilities of man Cold War syndrome , much ? but seeing as it has been a far while since the fall of the Berlin wall , a slight change of plot devices is necessary . His reason is this : he is a friend of the Earth , he 's out to look after it , but humans are too busy destroying it and there are only so many planets which can support life in the universe , so the human race which has been watched my Klaatu and his kind for many years to see if they change their attitude are now next on the to-be-extinct list . But Jennifer Connelly 's Helen is adamant that people can change and begs with Klaatu to change his mind and while he ca n't see the better things in people and sets about planning the extermination -LRB- the spheres actually turn out to be something like mini-Noah arks which protect the planets animals while its other inhabitants will be dying -RRB- she takes it upon herself to become the sole savior of mankind in showing him that they can change , that they will , and they 'll be no need to wipe them out . Reeve 's plank-blank face makes him perfectly cast as someone trying to act human . His performance turns from confusion and unease at being in a human body , to disgust at the human race for being so negligent , and eventually to that of pity which makes him mankind 's redeemer -LRB- God\/Christ parallels , anyone ? -RRB- . He is very cool and calculated , always in control , even when you think he 's not he finds a way witness his escape from federal custody for more details . Meanwhile , Connelly turns in a tough , determined woman , Hell-bent on showing the good in people to our alien visitor and his giant robotic friend GORT who does most of the dirty work . But it essentially Klaatu who is the more identifiable character here . He might be an alien , he might be wanting to destroy every last sole on the planet , but when you look at why , you ca n't help but agree . The update from Cold War fear to environmentalism is a daring step for the crew but it feels less patronising than some may think . Klaatu and GORT may be the interstellar equivalent of militant tree huggers but at least they 're doing what they believe in with some gusto . Visually , the film is a spectacle . The move from any kind of classic UFO form is a wise one , to step aside from those corny clich s , and as stated above they do have their Biblical connotations as they protect from the forthcoming flood -LRB- or nanobots which eat everything -RRB- from GORT which , when they 're released , are quite a sight to behold . As for GORT `` himself '' , a God-knows-how-tall mechanical meany who looks very humanoid ; his glowing strip of an eye and sheer power is enough to put the willies up anyone . In conclusion , and not really caring what the original fanboys want to say about it -LRB- `` Oh my Gawwwddddd , boycott it ! '' yeah , dudes , try something else , because boycotting only gets something more publicity -RRB- this reviewer at least will give you an unbiased opinion on a film which , yes , is n't the most original one you might see this year -LRB- or next -RRB- , but its certainly one that 'll entertain many an audience .

" Movie will outlast bad reviews . My apologies if I release some SPOILERS not already mentioned , but I 've already seen quite a few . But I just saw the movie and am grateful to have a place to share some thoughts . Come back after you 've SEEN the movie , and this will make more sense anyway ... Let 's get one thing out of the way ... this movie is NOT Citizen Kane . But it is n't as bad as many of the reviewers are making it out to be , and really , if you compare the KIND of movie it was back in 1951 -LRB- grade B sci-fi flick ... maybe even B - ? -RRB- this compares rather well . The movie makes you think , but it really does NOT make you think in the way you think it does . Certainly NOT if you take it at face value . But it seems to me even the DIRECTOR did n't know the real gem that exists within this movie , although SOMEBODY did . I 'd almost wager a kind of bet between the Director , Producer , and\/or Screenwriter . Somebody lost , and it was definitely the movie ! This movie is NOT necessarily about militarism , though the original was , and it would have done the movie credit if it had kept that element . It is ostensibly about conservation , but not really . The true `` message '' of this movie is given by the Professor -LRB- John Cleese -RRB- and it 's the one Keanu\/Klaatu use to save the day . See the movie and that comment will make sense . Now , here 's the TRAGEDY of the screenplay . When Keanu and Jada Pinkett Smith are in the truck together , they talk about Jada now not wanting Keanu to get killed . I was waiting on the edge of my seat for Keanu to simply ask the boy `` WHY ? '' and it would have been an INFINITELY better movie . That in itself would have explained the whole rest of Keanu 's actions without the tawdry stupid melodramatic scene in the cemetery . Certainly any alien civilization that would know enough about Earth to know English , would have seen enough tawdry melodramatic scenes like this ... enough to either roil their digestive juices of want to cauterize the planet anyways . And one more note . If we act ANYWHERE NEAR as stupid as we do in this movie when visited by another civilization , Earth deserves to be blown to smithereens , no matter HOW melodramatic humanity may be or how many life supporting planets are left out there ! Overall , I think this movie is well worth seeing , and will stand the test of time well ... when all the reviews have been forgotten . The same fate as the original . " ,8
" The Day My Brain Stood Aghast ... . A major stink-burger of a remake . An outstanding candidate for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment . The short story by Harry Bates , ` Farewell to the Master ' on which the original film is based , was in itself an intriguing yarn that made its own political statement . The 1951 film with Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal captured the same xenophobic feel of the original story even though the plot was changed a bit for the film . However the 2008 version was as aimless as it was unintelligent . We all understand that remakes of classics are always difficult propositions , and this effort was no exception , but when a film simply becomes a vehicle for the CGI team and the story is basically thrown out , what 's left ? This script had more holes in it than a wheel of Swiss cheese and stunk 10 times worse than Limburger . OK , so instead of the earth as nuclear bomb-crazed , loose cannons , warned of our impending destruction because of our potential inter-stellar aggression , we are instead told that because we are polluting\/destroying the life on the planet , humans must be eliminated to preserve the rest of life on earth . Huh ? Given that the space guys got here with some fairly advanced technology , I was thinking maybe they would have some solutions to the problem , would n't you think ? Maybe they could , you know , help us out ?? How does killing one form of life automatically save all the other forms of life ? Ah , but I 'm sorry - I was being logical . Something with which the writers of this mental puke-fest have limited or no experience . Throw in an obnoxious kid continuing to suffer from PTS due to a dead father -LRB- how this plot thread got thrown in to the film is an unfathomable mystery -RRB- , a complete waste of Jennifer Connolly 's and John Cleese 's talents , and a ` plague of flies ' that eat steel and concrete as easily as they devour humans and you 've got a bucket of mind-bending drivel . Were the writers actually going for the Biblical analog of the ` plague of locusts ' to pander to a potentially Christian audience ? Are we talking Keanu Reeves as Moses ? It sure makes me wonder ... for about 1\/10 of a second , but then - who cares ? What you end up with is a poorly directed hodgepodge of special F\/X driven by the ultimate designed-by-a-committee script . My vote for the worst film of the year and a neck-and-neck tie with ` Plan 9 from Outer Space ' for worst sci-fi movie of all time . Then again , make it the worst - at least ` Plan 9 ' was funny ...

" Worse Trash I Have Ever Seen . Summary : Worse trash I have ever seen . From the beginning till the end . I have never seen a more perfect example of disrespect and bad manners to be taught to children . In the past , movies taught respect and good manners to be taught to children .

She is the one that organizes the anti war rallies and helped `` Organize '' people that show up to rally 's like Obama 's -RRB- He made all America sick by misleading the country by really meaning `` change '' to socialism . If you do n't believe this then look up the book `` Rules for Radicals , the book as written and taught by the admitted communist Saul Alinski to Obama . In that book the real plot of change is revealed and is more scary than any movie could portray . In that book change means change to socialism . Look it up . Look it up . Any way as that relates to this movie when they said we need change . I was so sick of hearing the socialist dribble that it made me want to up chuck . And as for the insects flying around eating up everything , that looked like they stole that scene from the last mummy movie . Sick stupid movie and a waste of time and money . " ,1
" Is this the emotion you humans call ... love ? . Oh dear ... The day after the day after tomorrow when the earth 's screenwriters stood still . This really is a dreadful piece of film making . The plot has more holes than my grandpa 's string vest and the acting is appalling ; the script is terrible and the direction is dull and plodding . On the surface we seem to be faced with the usual Hollywood `` save the planet '' Liberal agenda . However , on closer inspection , this film seemed to have an underlying message that I found quite distasteful and not a little disturbing : i.e. we should n't worry our pretty little heads about the environment and we can all carry on as normal because `` only when humans are on the precipice will we change and do the right thing '' -LRB- I 'm paraphrasing here as I 'm certainly not gon na watch this piece of crap again simply to get the quote right -RRB- . As another comment on this site says , it 's as if the filmmakers are intentionally trying to keep the audience passive by giving the impression that love and\/or a simple quick fix will eventually save the day . I found this `` carry on regardless '' message quite worrying , although it probably does explain the less than subtle product placement ... File next to Spielberg 's War Of The Worlds remake - i.e. in the nearest trash can " ,4
" when did that happened . I have n't seen the original film but that remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still is a bit shallow . The special effect are really good , no question about it . The acting is considerably good , but the plot itself is so bleak the characters look a bit lost and uncoordinated . Keanu Reeves is very authentic as the alien Klaatu , but then we have already seen them big pretty eyes . I did like the message and I bet all environmentalists did too , `` Planet die , you die . You die , planet lives . '' What a better way to tell someone they are not wanted . With that thought in mind Jennifer Connely 's biologist have to convince Klaatu to stop the apocalypse . The only sensible conversation in the whole movie was the one at the professor 's house , about us being on the brink of self-destruction is when we are going to change our ways in order to survive . Simple , logical , pure genius . Then onwards was just a chase with time and so obviously inevitable saving of the world , because Klaatu has seen that there is more to people than meets the eye . The reasons the characters follow and their behavior is a bit arbitrary not to say illogical . Klaatu too , first so powerful and determined ; later a bit confused ; and at the end so incapable to finish what he came for or to stop it for that matter . It is a good message about how we should really try and save the planet while we still can but it is a really bad reason why we should be saved . " ,4
" Not worth the time . As usual Jennifer Connelly looked great but that just is n't enough for an entire movie . I liked the 1950 's automaton but the movie was boring . If you have to see it wait until its free then you only waste your time . The idea of bringing your child with you in the most risky situation was already shown to be a flop when Dakota Fanning screamed all through `` War of the Worlds '' . This was different , this kid asked annoying questions and did stupid things . To top it off if she was going to bring him with why did n't she take him to the army base ? The government would have probably -LRB- at least in movie logic -RRB- brought all of their families with . I do n't know many five year olds that undisciplined . The science was fun the effects were cool the actors did well . Was it bad writing , directing or editing . can someone come up with an original idea ? Too many one dimensional characters . All of the military . Kathy Bates 's character was awful . What makes Hollywood think that we are going to accept that people will do something that they know is futile because `` the president said so '' . Take a step back to reality . You have an extremely intelligent person that knows that they will die along with the rest of the world if they follow a moron , but they did it anyways . I cant take stupid stuff like that . My 4 year old 's cartoons have more common sense " ,3
" Good Grief ! . Too many tom , dick harry 's writing their silly reviews of their own opinions of how exactly bad this movie is , is rather , in my opinion ridiculous in it 's own little way . Plainly put , this movie does not even come close to what the original was , whether or not that was the intention baffles me . It was just plain horrible . A movie made 57 years ago is still better than it 's remake , 57 years later , and it 's in black and white and was filmed during the `` cold war '' when paranoia 's were high and the reds were everywhere . I just do n't get Hollywood these days . I guess they just sit around a table and say : `` Hey , let 's make a movie '' or better yet : `` We have no ideas of our own , so let 's remake something , get the top billed actors in it , pay them heap loads of money whether it 's good or not and let 's make some money boys '' . Wow , i 'm just shocked how annoying this movie was , and jayden smith as the little boy in the movie was annoying , if not more annoying than dakota fanning in `` The War of the Worlds '' remake with tom cruise or jar jar binks in Star Wars the phantom menace , etc. " ,1
" It 's time for another remake of the Day the Earth stood still ... . The day the Earth stood still . Yeah , it 's another remake . I used to go to the cinema at least once a week , sometimes even twice . I guess that was 10-15 years ago . Today my cinema visiting frequency has dropped to around 6 a year , and is likely going to drop even further . Why would I have to pay for dumb remakes that are literally so filled with commercials that in reality the cinema should be paying me to watch all that crap ? I do n't like McDonalds and never will ! Okay what 's positive about this movie ? I did like the special effects , and the special effects and Keanu Reeves in his Matrix part 4 role ; especially the special effects he did . Did I mention the special effects already ? No , no nonsense , I quite liked the three main actors , and even John Cleese was fun to watch , although pretty unbelievable as a scientist . Okay what 's negative about this movie ? Well , the rest . The story is crap and unbelievable , and definitely less than the original . Somehow crappywood studios still seem to think that they can make any movie a blockbuster as long as they fill them with heaps of special effects . I guess they 're right , and a future filled with even crappier superhero movies seems to be its evidence . I 'll challenge anyone to count the number of not-so-hidden commercials in this movie , at least that gave me something to do while I was n't enjoying the movie and thinking about all the things I could have done with my $ 16.50 . I guess I should have bought myself a real SciFi book . Millions of mindboggling fantastic SciFi books out there , but no , let us do another remake that 's worse than the original . Crappywood people out there go and read some real Sci-Fi and go and make a real movie ! What 's happened to all your creative minds ? Mork the Borg " ,4
" since so many people did n't like it , I might as well , put in my own two cents . For the record , I have n't seen the original . -LRB- maybe that 's why I liked it -RRB- I just saw the movie a couple of hours ago , and I liked it . The acting was great , Keanu doing what he does best , being cool and stoic in any situation , and Jennifer Connelly was just brilliant . I think she 's doing great now . Jaden Smith was such a brat that you just wanted to smack him on the head , which is exactly what a kid like him should be like . The American government portrayed by Kathy Bates was so cold you get frustrated , but is n't that what the government was like before the new president to come ? -LRB- Which also reminds me that , does n't the movie sort of bring up Obama and Bush ? Bush being the bellicose `` world leader '' and Obama , being brought up by a white woman ? If it 's just me , then oh well -RRB- Anyways , this movie was great in a sense that they try to discuss what humans are doing to the earth . It has a great underlying theme , and has pretty nice FX to go with it . thumbs up . " ,8
" True To The Original . Version one of The Day The Earth Stood Still was a timely and classic cautionary tale of humanity 's danger to itself and others . This second version is a no less timely compliment to the original . The movie 's beginning is a well conceived introduction to another encounter of a third kind . However , thanks to the fact that Steven Spielberg had no input , the contact is far less warm and fuzzy . Many reviews have complained that Klaatu Reeves is too stiff . Who were they expecting , Christopher Llyod ? Do n't let these hacks ruin the movie for you . Reeves does his usual best . While there are more characters in this version than the original , one additional but minor subplot , and far more special effects , this version is true to the narrative of the original . For those who demand their thrills more action packed and matrix-like , this version , like the original , will disappoint . For those who enjoy seeing the usual authorities being put their place , this movie will delight . The ending will leave you guessing . Is the cure to human nature 's negative effects as simple as taking away all our toys ... and living like our forebears , without electricity ? The new The Day The Earth Stood Still , is n't simply concerned with atomic weapons . Not only are the technologies which sustains our everyday lifestyle unsustainable , our politics of change are insufficient . No worry . The `` problem '' is taken care of for us . " ,8
" Not Bad At All . First of all , i never saw the original so i can be objective about this movie , and also , i read all the negative comments so i was pretty skeptikal about this movie before seeing it . But , it was a good surprise after all . The movie kept me interested till the end , i never knew what 's it going to happen next . The only annoying thing was the kid , and the fact that i did n't feel the connection between Klatu and us , the human race as a species , how did the kid and the woman convince him , that , as a race , `` change '' can happen . Asides from this , i liked it , it IS a good movie , especially compared to all the letdowns of this year . THe end , was a bit rushed , but all in all it 's a good experience , a great story -LRB- allthogh it felt like the ' 50 's -RRB- , i just loved Keanu as the main actor , although the other actors are average at best . AS a conclusion , do n't believe all the bad reviews . The movie is good . I do n't compare it to the original , since i did n't view it , especially so i can write a review , without being influenced by it . Worth the watch . " ,8
" A good afternoon out . First off let me say I 've not seen the original , but this was an entertaining film by itself I thought . I do n't think this completely ruins the original , as most remakes are prone to do , but yet I 'd have to have seen the original to make a proper opinion . It was up-to-date and flash , with some spectacular CG , with some developments on characters -LRB- or so I 've read -RRB- that made it more interesting , like having to win Klaatu over , instead of him automatically being on our side . I would say that Jacob is thoroughly unlikeable though . Certainly by no means a classic , but not as bad as other people are making out . " ,7
" interesting remake of a catastrophic movie adjusted to modern times . Wise 's flick lingers in the viewer 's memory as one of those sophisticated films that used to be very common in the 70 's and 80 's , showing American anxieties in broad allegories and metaphors . This remake tries to update the old atomic-era paranoia changing it with an environmentalist and new eco-message . It 's about an alarming and cautionary tale , full of menace and warnings ; it coddles the audience with the happy ending -LRB- assuring all these bad things will eventually work themselves out -RRB- and sometimes seems to be filled with hidden publicity . Acting is not great but good -LRB- Reeves is not up to Matrix performances -RRB- . " ,7
" If You have n't watched the original you 'll like it . It is entertaining regardless . . After reading many reviews before watching this movie i was hesitating to watch it at the cinemas . But i thought i 'd go and watch it with my bros. as nothing really good was on at the time . I have n't seen the original so ca n't compare and so i am judging my view on this movie as it is . Acting but Keanu was as many say stiff but he is playing as an alien so he has to be emotionless . Jennifer Connelly just yet another great job and Will Smith 's son was n't bad at all for his debut movie . I have to admit with others it starts off fantastic but the end is n't as good as one would expect but hey it has to climax one way or another . I think it just needed a few more minutes in the end for it to have been better . The special effects are fantastic so this is one key factor to watch it in the cinemas especially in IMAX . If you want to take your family out or girlfriend to the cinemas go watch this I 'm sure she -LRB- girlfreind -RRB- would get engrossed into it and the kids would love it special effects-wise . Even if the story or dialogue etc is n't good the special effects make up for it allowing for a good sci-fi action , thriller . In the end these reviews are based on opinions and are one sided . Mine really is n't as i 'm not comparing it to old film or how the script was done or this and that was n't in place etc. . I 'm telling you what the film is like as it is . Truthfully this movie has seriously been underrated . I think you would agree its better to watch this kind of movie at the cinemas than a Christmas flick . Its makes going to the the cinema more worthwhile and your moneys worth . If you have the urge to watch it do it do n't let these or any reviews put you down . I did and i liked it . You may as well . " ,8
" Love the Original ... Cool on IMAX ! . First , as to the many thumbs down IMDb reviews let us take a collective deep breath and one full step back . The mainstream LA Times movie critic gave the film his thumbs up . More to the point 46.5 % of IMDb 's 7,908 reviews gave the film SEVEN to TEN stars ! 13 % of those viewers gave the film TEN STARS . If we toss in SIX star reviews then a whopping 59.8 % , the overwhelming majority of IMDb reviewers , gave the film SIX to TEN stars . My expectations for the film were low going in BUT my IMAX expectations were higher . The latter proved spot on . This was a cool film to enjoy on the IMAX screen . It had a very good music track . It 's excellent special effects have deservedly been nominated for a Satellite Award -LRB- prior nominees Lord of the Rings , Independence day etc. -RRB- . That was reason enough for me to head to my IMAX and reason enough for me to enjoy the film from start to finish . Of course there is the flip side , the reasons I could never go ten stars on this one . The screen writers created an annoying kiddie brat out of Jaden Smith 's -LRB- Jennifer 's son -RRB- character . There was his never ending ` my dad would kill him ' mantra , hard core disdain for his step mother , his insistence on using her first name and a scene where he fails to utter a single word of remorse when his ` act ' inadvertently but never the less results in the death of numerous innocent soldiers . As for other actors , Keanu Reeves and his oftentimes emotionless gaze were well cast . Jennifer Connelly , at least in my cinema book , does few cinema ` wrongs . ' Here she does well as a one woman ` army ' with the burden of her world saving mission . Cathy Bates does OK in her brief scenes , playing a snarly , grump faced Secty of State . After some thought I realize that in both films Klaatu arrives on Earth with the same mission , to WARN Earthlings before it is too late . In this version the mission changes when Klaatu is denied an opportunity to address the peoples of the world via the U.N. . The intervention of John Cleese , playing the Jaffe ; Professor Barnhardt , blackboard and all , is a welcome reprise . His meaningful discussion with Klaatu is the lynch pin of the films conclusion and in fact makes sense . After all , Klaatu had authority to WARN Earth , to change his mission and hence to change it ` again ' as the film rolls toward its conclusion . There is nothing to prevent Klaatu 's return to Earth in the near distant future should that prove necessary . The above , along with suspense of belief , is sufficient to permit Klaatu to react to his minimal albeit close contact and experience with several humans so that the few may in fact impact his ` current ' decision , one he can easily alter at a later date . His awesome power will remain at the ready . The inclusion of the actual day the Earth stands still seemed ill placed and gratuitous though totally reminiscent of the original version . All machines , electric , time etc. stopped while Michael Rene prevented related deaths and destruction . All in all I enjoyed the IMAX viewing despite the movies obvious short comings . " ,7
" No resonance , but some nice effects . I never heard of Bach before ? . This movie tried to please all . It failed to please any . The genre is not dead I hope , but a good plot is hard to find . ID-4 did once as much deliver as it was convincing : city sized UFO 's suddenly there , unforgettable shots , like the shadows in Central Park , the explosions and the Area 51 true size set . A lot of money spent , which showed ! It had a happy end and humor , too . OK , it took a cartoon plot with a comedy end . But it was brilliantly spectacular , fun , with many story elements of people and places coming together . That was 1996 . Since then we have had the Matrix , the bar is higher , the mood has shifted . The start of The Day The Earth Stood Still was good , drawing me in , as any UFO landing would do . I also liked the beautiful mysterious worlds of light appearing everywhere , and the idea of a human born alien although the telepathy in ID-4 was somehow more appropriately distant from us , and more compelling . Then the movie lost it ; Keanu being shot trying to reach out to the first human hand . No infrared binoculars , nor strict instructions for the soldiers there ? Bad start , but his organic Samsonite absorbed the bullet and saved the bad story . Why did Keanu let himself be captured , without simply using his power immediately ? To increase suspense on his intentions ? Are authorities since Jaws always stupid and bad ? JFK would have given him his UN chat he wanted . Keanu escaped . Then what ? He knew too little about us . Any smart alien that can solve quantum mechanics -LRB- or was it Einstein 's Relativity with the non-zero cosmological constant ? -RRB- would have done his homework , also on our nature : most of us never change , not even on the brink of disaster , or we would spoil everything again later . Until then the movie had some suspense , but when our impending doom became clear the race to give us a second chance was not as gripping as it could have been . Was another plot needed ? Too many loose ends , too . Why was a total sum of preserved species more important than preservation of intelligent life ? Perhaps we were not intelligent enough anyway . Then the human shaped robot . Its only purpose was to expel the vital dust that would erase mankind , or was it a blast from the past to show this was a remake ? The only interesting plot would have been a big one , not a miniature ` your daddy is dead honey ' story focusing on problems of a mother with her son . He was hanging out only with them . How about mankind ? Would n't a study of the mass behavior underlying our problems have given a much more interesting plot idea ? This movie took Keanu to a ` real ' leader . A Nobel Prize winner , of course . Why not just a kind neighbor called Jim ? Keanu then would walk up to the -LRB- loud -RRB- speakers to hear him whisper ` the Rolling Stones ' instead of ` It 's Bach ' . The Goldberg Variations are indeed great , but since Hannibal Lecter now a tune reserved for smart people ? Keanu could have listened to ` you ca n't always get what you want ' , ` sympathy for the devil ' , ` time is on our side ' . After ` welcome to the jungle ' and ` run to the hills ' he would have said ` this stuff rocks ' instead of ` it 's beautiful ' . Jim would have offered him his last beer . Is n't sacrifice also noble ? Jim : ` It 's Bud ' . Alien : ` It 's heaven ' . What now ? We die , no more beer ergo , Bud became the beer that saved the world ! Serious , Keanu should have made it to the UN . The real challenge of the story is how all people can come together to fix the dichotomy between individuals and countries . Keanu could have given us some difficult task , not only to stop eating McDonalds and watching Oprah , but more like ` invent something I can not do , a wormhole ' , ` hands across America ' reloaded . Perhaps ` make a good science fiction remake ? Could we pull that off ? Nobody knows , nor would the world . Every hour wasted would mean one city down or so , as in ID-4 ? It would increase tension for sure . Theme : our salvation as a collective effort . Not that of a mother seeing her dead husband back in her son , the catharsis that nothing is wasted . Enough material for Keanu 's epiphany like ` o , humans can be nice after all ' ? What if he would have met an asocial family instead ? Maybe Keanu should have destroyed us , except some sterilized people with low IQ scores to insure they would never rethink string theory to rebuild everything in no time . That plot might have had some resonance . Keanu 's take-off left me empty handed . He pulled the plug on our industrial revolution . Was that all he 'd got ? Steven Seagal would have said ` then I will have to kill you ' . No more electricity ? Our civilization would surely not end in the happy rebuilding as in WALL-E . But hey , thrown back to the Stone Age , wars and environmental destruction would give a nice Mad Max sequel for next summer ! I give a 7 since I was still entertained . Reeves and John Cleese did a good show for their script . Audiences are spoiled now . It takes a lot for a movie to be unforgettable . Still , I like the genre . UFO 's , effects , good actors and a big budget are not enough . Suspense comes also from plot . And often uncompromising scenes are the most memorable . Alien showed that in 1979 . A missed chance . Let us hope that ` As Worlds Collide ' will show us not only more effects we have never seen before , but that it will focus on the human condition better . Nice anyway to see Keanu back in space !

" A decent enough remake , that maybe tries to take itself a bit more seriously than it should . STAR RATING : \*\*\*\*\* Saturday Night \*\*\*\* Friday Night \*\*\* Friday Morning \*\* Sunday Night \* Monday Morning Scientist Dr Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connolly -RRB- and a group of other experts are taken by mysterious government agents in the middle of the night for reasons they ca n't work out . They learn a giant asteroid is headed towards earth and they have only seventy eight minutes to avert it . As it falls to earth , the military are called in to take out the threat , come what may . They encounter a giant robotic creature , as well as a giant alien shell that contains Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves . -RRB- Re-awakening and adjusting to his surroundings , Klaatu is held at a research facility against his will , until he uses some mysterious powers to break out . On the run , he eventually hooks up with Dr Benson who upon learning his true intentions here on earth , is forced to test her will to the ultimate level . The original The Day the Earth Stood Still film still retains some of it 's cult greatness , even though it 's easy to laugh at it 's now rubbery special effects and campy fifties dialogue -LRB- no doubt ground breaking at the time ! -RRB- But it carried a serious tone , set against the cold war angst of the time and warnings of what could happen if man failed to learn to live in peace with each other . By applying that philosophy to modern times , Scott Derrickson 's new film may have alienated some of his audience by giving it such a serious , reflective tone instead of just the undemanding ` blockbuster ' type film everyone was expecting -LRB- says it all that it was n't released in the summer . -RRB- Any film where John Cleese makes a non-comedic cameo -LRB- even playing a character called Basil ! -RRB- is probably in need of a bit of loosening up . Performances wise , in the lead role Reeves , by his own admission in a magazine interview , tried to make his character ` more flat and expressionless . ' No stretch there then . In support , rising star Connolly plays her role quite well , as does veteran co star Kathy Bates as the ball busting head of the facility who ca n't accept her opinion might not be right . The special effects , including Gort -LRB- whose name here is cleverly taken from a military abbreviation to mean Genetically Organic Robotic Technology ! -RRB- turning into a flying pile of soot that destroys everything in it 's path , are quite good but the story fails to really generate a decent narrative flow and so does n't really hold your attention and the ending seems to just come and go and failing to wrap things up properly . It 's not an awful re-make , thoughtful , reflective and with some decent effects , but it probably does n't hold your attention quite as well as it should . \*\*\* " ,7
" TDTESS -- remake . Well , I 've read ALL of the reviews from top to bottom ... I think they 're hypercritical to say the least . I loved the 1951 version of Day so much , that I purchased it when it came out on tape -LRB- that 's right , tape -RRB- , for $ 100 . YEP . You read right ! I even had it ordered and paid for before I received it from the manufacturer . OK , that being said . I loved the remake . The only thing that could have been enhanced were some of the scenes . . 1-more dialogue and scene between Klaatu and Bernhardt , 2-more interaction between little Benson and mother , between little Benson and Klaatu ... and 3-enhanced scenes of GORT , showing what he 's made of , and what he can do . Other than that , it was awesome , there is no comparison to the original , completely enhanced and better suited for today 's generation , with a specific message for all of us , young and old . I 'm definitely going to buy it on DVD to add to my collection . And as for the message ... I think we all should take it seriously . No-one knows what 's out there , we may actually find ourselves in a similar situation if we do n't change our ways . I 'm giving it a 9 -- and saying , GREAT JOB EVERYONE ! " ,8
" Not good or bad , but okay . . I Will probably watch the 1951 classic version soon , when it comes on AMC again , I 'm sure back in the day , The Day The Earth Sood Still was considered a masterpiece , but today considering the successes of Close Encunters Of The Third Kind -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , Stargate -LRB- 1994 -RRB- , The Arrival -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , and Indapendence Day -LRB- 1996 -RRB- . It pretty much is nothing spectacular . Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- is suddenly called fr a secret mission , when an alien visitor and a giant alien robot named Gort , come to earth , when Helen tries to greet it , a nervous soldier shoots it wounds it . The alien is brought to a hospital on the base , were it begins to morph into human form , and we learn his name to be Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- , and he says he wants to speak to earths leaders . But the people on the base worry about an invasion , they keep Klaatu prisoner . But Helen feels that Klaatu intentions are not what they appear , she sets him free , She and her step son -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- go on the run with Klaatu , in hopes to figure out the real reason he has come to earth . This was not great , but not truly awful either . Keanu Reeves gives a commendable performance as the emotionless alien Klaatu , he is like Mr. Spock , minus the ears and eyebrows . And Jennifer Connelly is also good . Although Reeves and Connelly have good chemistry , but that never evolves real far has it should . But Jaden Smith really got on my nerves , although he is just a kid , but he never shuts up . And Kathy Bates character I think loves more the sound of her voice , then anything else . The effects are alright , but not great . But hay do n't skip it , rent it at least . " ,7
" my movie was remade and ... . -LRB- some spoilers -RRB- it was interesting . Now first of all let me point out how important the classic is , I 'm only 17 and i 've seen it 8 times and enjoy it every single time . Its a classic because future generations will watch it again and again . Its one of the best movies ever made top ten in my opinion , that said it makes sense Hollywood would want to remake this right ? Not in this case , i saw my classic loved movie get a whole new turn around in a bad direction . As the movie started i was actually hooked , i was putting myself in that position like `` holy crap thats a flying globe in the air run away '' . But once Keanu was introduced i was lost so much hope for this movie . Here i thought a perfect emotionless role for him its perfect how could he end up ruining it , well he did . I honestly do n't know how he has an acting career . It was that bad . Now my second problem is Gort , OMG one thing directors of horror remakes tend to do is to make the killer like 7 feet taller . take halloween -LRB- 2007 -RRB- michael myers is not going to be more intimidating if he 's the size of shaq , he still scares me no need for extra height . Gort is practically the size of a huge skyscraper . Thats not necessary . Now for the most part this movie has the same premise , klatuu comes to `` help '' this time and he does n't leave telling us if we do n't stop the fighting he 'll come back , in this version he says screw it your killing earth so i 'm not going to hesitate and kill you . By the way if you do n't know yet this is an environmental `` lets be green '' movie . and it wants to make you feel like crap by saying your the main reason why the earth is dying shame on you . and then you have a decent performance by Jennifer Connelly except every time she says `` give us a second chance , we can change . '' OMG she repeats this line so much it gets annoying . Her only downfall from acting in this movie . Overall she was great . Now two performance i was disappointed with , first Kathy bates , sad day for her . She was the only one who seemed to try and save this movie but still not enough . Second Jaden Smith , i loved him in pursuit of happiness . Amazing performance but here he falls flat . It was pretty bad , its like the producer said lets put some ethnic people in this movie . Maybe if Will smith was klatuu then Jaden could soar . There was one good scene for jaden when he takes klatuu to his dad 's grave and asks him to revive him and he says no . That was a good scene until Jennifer comes in and hugs jaden . I 'm guessing there was no chemistry between the too . quick side notes why are most movies now product placements ? klatuu in McDonalds ?? come on Now if you 've seen the trailer you can see that a truck and stadium vaporize . any guesses to what that is ?? Its gort as tiny little bugs flying all over causing destruction Now Jennifer asks klatuu `` can you stop it ? '' `` i 'll try '' ? What just try ? why does he hesitate ? by this point he has seen humans can love and blah blah blah you get the idea Not once does he say the magic words `` klaatu barada nikto '' i was waiting so much for that but never happened . I tried to like this movie so much but it never happened . the ending was awful and klatuu never made a final statement like in the original . Yes save the earth important message but the way this movie tries to send it is awful . Trust me you wont die if you do n't see this movie , whether you 've seen the original or not do n't see this one , not worth it . 2\/5 stars " ,4
" A Nutshell Review : The Day The Earth Stood Still . Tis the season to be jolly , and because of the success of Will Smith 's I Am Legend remake last year , I suspect tis the season for Hollywood to look at some of its past science fiction classics and set its gunsights on potential story lines to be redone , or `` reimagined '' on time for the holiday season , though the structure for this seemed to mirror quite closely to that of the original , save for the message to be preached . But as the saying goes , if it ai n't broke , please do n't fix it . While I still buy into the notion that us human beings will likely to wake up our ideas if we know for sure that we 're not the only civilization in the universe out there , that bickering amongst ourselves would be just plain silly in the face of potentially hostile creatures from outer space , the way Scott Derrickson presented this film , seemed more like a rehash of plenty of sci-fi elements from the likes of Independence Day -LRB- alien ships hovering around the globe -RRB- , Third Encounters of the Third Kind , Armageddon -LRB- seriously , I was half expecting Bruce Willis to board a space shuttle with his crew and enormous drillbit -RRB- , and even that obvious shade of the Matrix with Keanu 's shaven fetal state in goo . And could someone tell filmmakers that shots of empty streets of New York 's Times Square is already passe ? In this troubled time of ours , I thought the anti-war message is still quite relevant in today 's context of world conflict , where hatred seem to be the emotion running very high . The original 's message of peace does n't ring any truer now , though this remake preferred to take on the more environmentally green message that if we do n't take care of the Earth , the Earth will die and so will we , along with it naturally . But we Earthlings -LRB- or rather , the Americans -RRB- are a stubborn bunch , and toward all alien beings visiting our planet , they will dish out all available military hardware to obliterate anything that moves . Sure , like the original film , there will be some who will balk at the messiah like character of Klaatu , with his sudden appearance , of being born again in human form and performing miracles such as resurrections and healing . Some might also balk at Keanu Reeves ' tendency to play such messiah like characters , though a different camp would argue that he excels in roles such as these given his lack of acting range . And true enough , there is n't much for him to emote except to be in awe and to adjust in his new homo-sapien form . The cast were all truly wasted , as Jennifer Connelly seemed to remake her Helen Benson from her Hulk 's Betty Ross , while Jaden Smith did n't do much as the skeptical stepson Jacob Benson . Kathy Bates became a caricature as the Secretary of Defense , and John Cleese too was a flower vase as Professor Barnhardt . Yes , a male flower vase . If there 's any level of difficulty here in anyone 's acting , I 'd give credit to Keanu Reeves for his dare to converse in Mandarin , which I thought was quite alright -LRB- probably even better than mine ! -RRB- What was truly a letdown , was the pace at the final third of the film . The movie plods to the finishing line , and what do we get at the end of it ? Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer . The obvious parallels here to end the movie makes it look darn lazy , as you can substitute you know who for Galactus -LRB- a gaseous ball of mass -RRB- and for the Surfer himself . It 's anti- climatic and very lacklustre , and I for one would have applauded if it went along the lines of the original to shove down its message verbatim to the audience , rather than to provide such a hokey ending that made it all a joke and threw whatever impact of its good-natured message out the window . And not since Jack Neo do I see product placement coming in so intrusively , like MacDonald 's , and the one that took the cake , was that huge Microsoft Windows logo sitting pretty atop a glass table top for image manipulation . Those who would want to give this a go for its special effects , would like to know that all the extravagant money shots have already been included in the trailer , so you might want to save your money , and go rent the original instead , which is a classic in itself , rather than to sit through something that 's very bland and generic . Disappointing stuff . " ,2
" Intelligent Science Fiction . This is a Sci-Fi end-of-the-world film that is well done and held my attention . Actually , in this movie , it is not about a threat to the planet , just to its dominant species , us . Humanity is destroying the Earth and intelligent life in other parts of the universe want to save the planet -LRB- because planets suitable for life are scarce -RRB- by eliminating the human species . There are some of the stupid alien encounter clich s , notably repeated attempts to use conventional weapons against the alien even after it is clear the alien can nullify all such attempts . The conventional weapons include modern armed drones but also relatively old technology such as Sidewinder missiles . There is also no discussion of trying nuclear weapons . Nevertheless I liked the special effects , the acting , and the message that the Earth is at an environmental precipice . I see where many critics and commenters did n't like Keanu Reeves performance . I disagree . I thought the manner in which he portrayed the alien Kaatu as almost but not quite emotionless was very appropriate . " ,8
" This was very good ... I believe many missed several points . The original has always been one of my favorite movies of all time . It is true that despite it 's age this icon has held up well . However , this remake of an icon , is one of the better ones I have seen in several years . They did many great updates that made it fit our present technology level , and yet stayed incredibly true to the essence of the meaning of the film . In my opinion they actually enhanced the meaning of the title the day the earth stood still Many negative comments seem to indicate that some people missed key points that had been extremely well done . E.g. confusion about the mountain top meeting of the sphere and the human Keanu . Collecting the DNA , to later create - i.e. be born another human like creature that could move through our society and communicate . This DNA derived body was the only way Klaatu could have walked off that starship and not looked like a 2009 plastic repeat of a 1951 movie . As someone said , Klaatu did not care about us . He was here to firm up a final recommendation and do a job to preserve as many species on this planet as possible . Comments like , it 's not your planet and I 'm a friend of the earth spoke volumes . I thought Bates did a fine job , caught between her first hand knowledge of the situation and the reality of having to do what the President said to do , even if it was stupid . Cleese was a better than expected Nobel prize genius who , could both see the situation and communicate the feeling ... hey , we are in big trouble here . GORT - great acro , just like the military ... but they kept the name in the movie in a clever way . Given that GORT was just a bunch of nanobots , the human like traditional GORT form was fine ... since it was done for humans to understand and not freak out more than usual . What I liked best was , that this alien Klaatu did not believe in the human race , and either threw the switch , or did nothing to stop the process of removing this deadly human species , to protect all the others . But in a difficult way -LRB- for a totally alien mind -RRB- , Klaatu did slowly come around to realizing that humans could evolve when faced with the ultimate situation ... as the professor said . At that point he then said he did not know if he could even stop the process . Thus the ending made perfect sense . Klaatu , made the decision to permit human survival , in the only way he could . He killed -LRB- shut down -RRB- GORT -LRB- the nanos -RRB- and all other machinery on the planet ... not just for hour of one day ... but for all time . In my mind , The Day the Earth Stood Still is forever . Yes , probably billions of people will die , of starvation . No machines to farm or move crops around the globe . Less developed countries may do better than the developed since they already farm by hand . But the solution Klaatu has chosen will permit the humans to survive on an equal basis with the rest of the planet , albeit without machinery . It was good update that stayed true to the original warning that we humans can screw things up one way or the other . Whether it is nukes , or the destruction of the planet 's environment . " ,9
" Unbearable ... . http:\/\/eattheblinds.blogspot.com\/ I was lured to the cinema this week , hungering for a big blockbuster on the biggest screen in town . Unfortunately my choice was The Day the Earth Stood Still . When the movie opens in the freezing arctic , puffs of steam coming out of their actor 's mouth are noticeably absent . So much for realism . Sadly , the director wants to convince you this movie is actually set in the real world and he goes to great lengths to prove so ... trouble is , he 's a hack and his efforts are strained , pathetically obvious and utterly unconvincing . You 'd think this film had the budget of a viral video considering how bad all the CG helicopters look . The flight scenes in Clint Eastwood 's Firefox look magnificent in comparison . As the action starts to ramp up , the horribly predictable dialogue becomes insufferable , incredibly fast . Throw in Will Smith 's kid who ca n't act and his Sideshow Bob hair-do , and your brain starts to fracture into mind mincing shards . I liked the Exorcism of Emily Rose , but because of this worthless attempt to remake a masterpiece , I 'll forever consider the name Scott Derrickson a curse to movie-making . Walkout time : 22:00 . Full refund issued . " ,3
" no soul . seeing the trailer and being a huge fan of the original i was somewhat cautious as to how this would turn out , well i 've just watched it and it appears i was right to be concerned , two films have made me fall asleep , the truly awful mimic and this . it started quite well , and then begun to descend into typical Hollywood remake trash , the plot was paper thin and not one character added to any feeling of empathy or concern for the protagonists , i really just wanted jaden smith to die , Jenifer Connelly just looked doe eyed throughout the entire production , and keanu , was he trying to recreate the original klaatu by being so wooden or was that his best efforts at acting , like war of the worlds this was a waste of money and time for all involved , save yourselves and do n't bother . " ,3
" Has Hollywood Gone Mad ?!!!!! . This movie is certainly one of the most awful movies that came out of Hollywood within the past decade . It is an abolishment to Robert Wise , and the people who put their work into creating the original `` The Day The Earth Stood Still '' from 1951 . This is a classic example when Hollywood tires to re-make a classic by simply adding CGI and special effects , ruining a masterpiece , and feeding on the brain dead audience that now and days is amused by on screen special effects . Truly the art of film making , and studying film has been lost , not only by the directors , but also by today 's audience . Furthermore , many of us have forgotten what to pay attention to in films . We ceased paying attention to things that matter or should matter in a movie . If this is what movies are going to come down to , God help Us All !! " ,1
" Tree huggers will love it ... anyone with a brain ... not so much ... . Yet another ` wake up before we destroy the Earth ' tirade from the liberals in Hollywood . Aye yi yi ... At least in the classic 1951 original there was a legitimate threat of nuclear annihilation . The modern version uses the fallacy of ` Global Warming ' as the impetus of ... I `` m sorry what 's that you say ? The Earth is cooling now ? Oh ... uh ... OK ... then the fallacy of ` Global Climate Change ' -LRB- that way we can blame carbon emissions , cow farts , and SUVs for ANY climate change up or down -RRB- as the justification for our extinction . All the other animals on planet Earth get the ` Noah 's Ark ' treatment from the benevolent Aliens , but not us evil humans ... apparently we missed the memo and torqued off said Aliens . The Aliens strut around our planet , judging us to be unworthy -LRB- like it is their planet or something -RRB- with all the emotion and passion of a three toed tree sloth . Wait a sec ... maybe it is their planet ... were we seeded here ? Intelligent design ? Who knows . The movie does n't address that sticky topic . I say we blame the Indians -LRB- dot , not feather -RRB- and the Chinese . They are n't buying their fair share of carbon credits . The Alien even rides around with a ` responsible ' scientist who drives a Hybrid no less -LRB- it would be hypocritical for an advanced being destroying us for our carbon emissions to get escorted around in an Escalade , right ? -RRB- . Product placements galore ! There is also some heavy anti-military overtones in the movie ... the little kid 's dead father would kick the alien 's butts if he was n't ... uh ... dead . Because he was in the Army ... and they kill stuff ... you know , ` cuz they 're the Army . \* sigh \* There were so many holes in the plot and silly leaps in logic it was ridiculous . This ranks as the second worst Sci-fi movie of all time -LRB- narrowly beaten out by the slaughtering of L. Ron Hubbard 's sci-fi novel Battlefield Earth in 2000 -RRB- . Uhg ... c'mon Hollywood ! If you are going to continue making this kind of tripe at least preach to us with something original ! Holy Toledo ... " ,2
" This Film SUCKS - See\/Rent\/Buy The Original Instead . This remake is WRONG on so many levels . The sad thing is that , given the talent and resources involved , it could have been great . The director completely misses what made the original such a wonderful film . Also , the plot points were necessary to drive the original story are either missing , or so muddied that they make no sense\/undercut the underlying idea . -LRB- See , e.g. , the final point below . -RRB- Instead , most of the creative energy was spent on special effects and CGI . These are impressive -LRB- in parts -RRB- , but `` CGI does not a story make . '' Robert Wise got more impact with a hubcap on a string for the spaceship , and a tall guy in a rubber suit for Gort . I can not figure out why this film got such a good review -LRB- in the Los Angeles Times -RRB- . It should have been panned . The same thing happened with the sequel to Hellboy : The second film spent much more on effects , and had none of the charm\/imagination of the first . Final point : The ending -- in which all the Earth 's machines\/technology -LRB- cars , computers , trains , etc. -RRB- are instantly stopped by the aliens -LRB- to make a `` greener '' planet ? -RRB- -- is completely against the `` Save Humanity '' message . Wiping out all technology in an instant means that 99 % or so of the human race would die of starvation or disease -LRB- or societal collapse -RRB- within a couple of months . Gee , thanks for `` saving '' our planet , aliens . " ,3
" this is the worst ! . well . . where do i begin . . i was n't going to even bother commenting on it , but i hated it so much i felt i had to aid in any way in stopping people wasting their time and money on the stupid film . Badly written . . i mean typical Hollywood sentimental script , pointless , i mean this is meant to be a action movie , but its trying to be everything ! and nothing worked . . i was sitting there cringing in my seat , laughing to myself . . at least a dozen people walked out , i wish i had too . please please please do n't see this . it really should have gone straight to DVD or cable . " ,1
" An awful film that stands still . Terrible in every sense of the word . Same set-up as Robert Wise 's original . Different execution . It pains me to say it , but Keeanu Reeves is the most convincing character . He plays a robot-like , monosyllabic alien who has come to Earth to destroy man so that the planet can be saved from environmental destruction . Jennifer Connelly helps him change his mind . The film has nothing good going for it . The dialog is stilted and clich d to the point of hysterics . Ed Wood would have had fun with it ; director Scott Derrickson does n't . For some dumb , PC reason , Jaden Smith -LRB- Will 's son -RRB- plays the adopted black son of Connelly . He 's written as an annoying SOB who should have been smoked by the Gort robot . Gort , by the way , resembles the original Gort ; he 's just taller . The pacing is at snail speed -LRB- almost still -RRB- and the special effects look like special effects . The climax writes the textbook on anti-climax and leaves us with a sour taste that Tyler Bates ' awful score ca n't sweeten . John Hamm , from the fantastic `` Mad Men '' , is thoroughly wasted . " ,2
" The Message or the Movie ? . Hmmm , let 's first say i see this movie more for it 's visualization of a message to humanity . Just like the original did . Humanity is thus twice cued to ` wake up ' , but it seems that until a real GORT arrives it may just remain a ` surreal movie ' ! Something ` out there ' to be ` judged ' ... anyone see the irony in this ? So - as far as the movie goes - it 's not too bad . Sure , aficionado 's of the original WILL have lots to pick holes in . But as a movie in it 's own right it does not fail as utterly as some seem to think . But that is always subjective . I liked it . And if i had to pick a singular distracting point to the movie it would be the ` new ' character of the little boy ... a very irksome little critter he portrays . And I did not fall asleep , the plot was ` relatively ' well done and if only they had used the mega bot GORT more it could had quite a punch ! -LRB- pun intended -RRB- . But to me the real part here is the message that is rather well delivered . Clear , Cleese and concise ! A message that is SO relevant right now . So for for me that outweighs any ` normal ' critiquing . Ultimately i think the messenger did quite well in delivering a clear and relevant message . " ,7
" It is what it is ... Unless you choose to buy into it ... A lot of the pieces are there ... The original , which should be viewed first , that `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- was remade from was ahead of it 's time in the style of it 's storytelling . This remake has assembled a handful of very good sequences . And , like the original , I enjoyed a great deal of the `` implied science-fiction '' . The attempt at `` stadium-fulls '' of overly subtle storytelling , however , will find this much more modern -LRB- if not futuristic -RRB- premise tough to buy in to . So much so , that the viewer may have to `` look for the story '' . Most viewers want the story to be `` presented to 'em '' , right ? Keanu Reeves `` saves it '' for me . I believe Keanu Reeves was a motion picture super star that has turned into a real , live movie actor . Ever since his performance in `` The Devil 's Advocate '' -LRB- 1997 -RRB- , he has done his job in portraying his characters very , very well . Hangin ' out with Al Pacino can do that . The highly-argued and debated `` Constantine '' -LRB- 2005 -RRB- sold me on his ability as an actor . What saved `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- for me is how consistent his face and body expression was early in the movie . I believed that he was Klaatu , period . But ; unless you are personally touched `` or reached '' by the sum parts of this movie , most viewers will be disappointed . " ,7
" The Earth Stood Still . I went to see The Day The Earth Stood Still and I expecting nothing less than a 2008 version of Independence Day with Keanu Reeves instead of Will Smith . It was n't . Not even in the slightest . The movie starts of with Keanu Reeves hiking up some snow covered mountain in India for reasons to complex for the simple movie watcher to understand i.e. for no apparent reason and not explained to the audience . We then cut to the wonderful Jennifer Connelly saying something to scientific for the simple movie watcher to understand i.e. to show the audience that she is intelligent . The movie speeds on at reasonable pace as a meteor is heading straight for earth , well when I say earth , I actually mean New York , which as we all know represents everything and everyone on earth . Jennifer Connelly , along with the US army and a few scientists who are all wearing glasses so that the simple movie watcher understands that these people are as intelligent as Jennifer , all head to Central Park where this big alien marble plants itself . Kathy Bates , sporting beehive that Marge Simpson would covet , was the Head of Defense . I did n't really pay much attention to her in any way , shape or form as I was to busy trying to remember where I knew her from - Titanic and Misery . Now New York has had its fair share of movie related disasters in recent times , whether it be tidal waves , asteroids , infectious zombie diseases , asteroids again -LRB- Deep Impact and Armageddon are apparently two different movies -RRB- but New Yorkers do not understand the concept of running - when a disaster happens I like to think that I will be running in the opposite direction shrieking like a crazy fool rather than standing watching the events unfold that will lead to my untimely death . Anyhow , instead of the earth being destroyed something even more bizarre happens when Keanu Reeves and what can only be described as an early concept drawing of a Sentinel abandoned from the X-Men series step out of the big alien marble . The US army in full on `` attack now ask questions and sheepishly apologise later '' mode shoot poor Keanu and off they all head -LRB- Jennifer Connelly included -RRB- to Area51 where Keanu easily escapes from and heads to his nearest police station -LRB- W.T.F ! -RRB- and calls Jennifer Connelly who , along with her step-son collects him . Turns out that earth is important to other alien races as it can sustain intelligent life , the most intelligent of us all being John Cleese . John discovers that humans are on the brink of destroying the planet and because they are only on the brink of their own man made self destruction they can be brought back from the brink if Keanu just gets back into his marble and leaves them alone . Which he does . Not straight away of course . It is only after a speech from Jaden Smith , who will keep the Smith acting dynasty lasting longer then the Douglas 's , Sheens and hell even the Baldwin 's , that breaks the ever stiff and straight -LRB- A.K.A CAN NOT ACT TO SAVE HIS LIFE -RRB- Keanu into realizing that humans are in fact OK and can change their ways . So he gets into his marble and leaves and the movie ends . Seriously . I was deceived by the trailer , I thought I was going to see an action movie with Keanu in full on `` Gun Totting American Do n't Worry We Will Save Only America '' mode . It was n't . It was more of a drama with only a few hints of action , which ultimately came to nothing - then the movie ended . And you know - I actually quite liked it 7\/10 . " ,7
" My dog would write a better script ... . Saw it today on TV and am glad I saved my money three years ago . SImple said : If Aliens would like to visit us , NEVER , I repeat , NEVER show them this film . They would destroy the entire planet ... Bad acting -LRB- Keanu , of course . The annoying kid ... I 've got aggression during his performance -RRB- Plot holes with the size of a comet crater ... Horrible CGI 's ... A completely senseless message among a completely senseless and ridiculous story ... This is the symbol of the lack of ideas Hollywood have right now . The bigger the budget , the smaller the money for a script , it seems . Annoying in all points . " ,1
" Humankind saved by spoiled brat - again . I saw this movie on TV last night , as I would have never gone to the cinema and wasted my hard-earned money on it . Especially not after having read some of the negative reviews posted here . I can not but agree with most of them . In a nutshell : Keanu Reeves was probably born to play this part . He is inexpressive and emotionless as the alien role is playing requires . Whether thanks to his acting skill or personality , I do not know , but he does a good job . Apart from him , everything else sucks . Connelly is totally unconvincing playing a scientist . Never saw any scientist looking like a model ; honestly , if you are that attractive , you plan a career in show business , not in a lab . The kid Will Smith 's son - is a total brat . Obviously he got the part thanks to daddy . But what has this got to do with actually being able to act ? Absolutely nothing . To compound the felony , humankind is supposed to be saved thanks to the emotional connection of the alien with this obnoxious child . If this was a real life situation , I think the alien would speed up destruction after having met this unbearable brat . How is whining and being a pain in the ass supposed to prove that humankind will change for the better ? If our salvation depends on a child especially one like this we are definitely doomed . And perhaps the aliens have a good point . " ,1
" Same idea perhaps BUT NEW MOVIE not REMADE . I do n't get these 300 + reviews . I saw the movie a few days after seeing the original again . -LRB- Saw it in the 50s at a theater , but a few years after its original release at a special matin e -RRB- ... I rented the DVD and enjoyed it . It was very minimal on FX and the acting by Neal and the kid and others like Hugh -LRB- ? -RRB- the boyfriend were pretty lame . I LOVED MICHAEL RENNIE and Sam Jaffe . This new version had some key scenes of the original ... like Klattu changing the blackboard problem the professor had ... the robot as protector of Klaatu ... the woman and a kid ... a boyfriend ... the BAD GOVERNMENT who shoot the guy without a threat ... other than those and a few others ... I watched this movie as a new story and film . The FX and CG were great . The microscopic eating beings were great ... the `` ark '' idea by Kathy Bates character was right on with all the animals going `` about '' the spheres . Klaatus turn around to see that humans were now at the `` precipous '' of possible change . I loved the scene with the lie detector expert going under the table . The bad humans and even the President insisting on using military force has been used soooooo many times in movies of the genre . The kid in this was very irritating though for his age a good actor . I had to laugh that the humans thought they could contain the robot . It was a good thing they had an elevator the same size of the robot to `` house '' him in ... lol ... ... the ending of the movie was not liked by many reviewers but it was just fine with me . All the destruction proved that these aliens mean business . We earthlings better get our act together regarding war , the environment , etc. ... or there will be no second change ... . I had a good time ... its too bad this movie has made only $ 35 million and it had a budget of $ 80 million , so no thanks to reviewers who hate CG and redoing movies this will be considered a flop ... well , not with me . " ,8
" Day of the nonsense . What is this ? An alien goes to McDonald 's and decides to destroy the world . And there 's some demented kid running around annoying everybody . I 'd blast the Earth too if it meant getting rid of that kid . A ridiculous remake . It has little if anything to do with the original . Instead of a cool disintegrator ray , we get some flying oragami cockroaches . And some dark clouds , too . Before , the aliens wanted us to stop fighting wars , now they 've appointed themselves ecology cops or something . They do n't like ... uhhh , whatever it is . Then there 's Kathy Bates as a Secretary of Defense with a bad hair day . Her lines are ludicrous ; I thought she 'd burst out laughing any second . And still there 's that punk brat getting on your nerves the whole time . Continuity does not exist in this film . After deciding to wipe out everybody , Klaatu saves somebody . So the guy can die with the rest of us , apparently . One scene shows TV news footage of world wide rioting and violence . The reporter breaks from this trivial story to report the front page banner news flash that there 's a man wanted by the police for questioning . Such foolishness goes on from beginning to end . Klaatu barada niktu . Translated means : Klaatu , zap that kid already , wo n't you ? " ,3
" A Wasted Effort . First , I think if a business decision is made to re-make a classic 50 's sci-fi movie the first rule should be , We take the BEST elements from the original and keep them intact , loyal to the original . In this version the only elements left intact were some of the character names . The heart of the original was removed for the sake of whatever new vision the writers and director had . I 'll keep it short as many have echoed my feelings . I will say to those true film fans that are reading this , see the original 1951 version . Be aware that the SFX are minimal in this version . It was n't about the SFX , the new unimproved version is about SFX . And that 's a shame . This is a wasted effort . " ,2
" bad sci-fi film . This film was bad . I even thought the special effects were pretty lousy . First there is some kind of giant robot that shoots a red laser out of a slit in its helmet . It kills all power and the noise causes people to fall over . And this robot just stays in one spot and finally the army some how designs a box to capture it in and study it . Just silly . The spheres were bad special effects too . And what do you say about Keanu Reeves acting . If his monotone voice it supposed to be alien like , well , I guess you could say he did OK . Otherwise , he really needs to stick to surfer\/cop movies . And the finally resolution of Jennifer Conley trying to convince the alien that humans can change was really bad . The alien finally says OK because she gives her stepson a hug in the graveyard . FINAL VERDICT : One of the worst sci-fi films to come out in a while . Even the special effects were poor . " ,3
" Overall and something little . While I was worried about the casting choice of Keanu Reeves in the movie , in the end it seemed someone else was the real Achilles heel . More on that in the next paragraph . Back to Keanu and his role . His character does not challenge him too much , acting-wise that is . Jennifer Connely gets to aid him , but both of them get let down by the script . There are so many plot holes , character holes and unexplainable mood changes , that would make Michael Bay proud . Seriously though , while any Michael Bay movie has a certain entertainment value , the message that is delivered here , makes it all even more unbearable . The icing on the -LRB- bad -RRB- cake is the child -LRB- performance -RRB- . So annoying that you wonder , why and how he could make people -LRB- or other creatures for that matter -RRB- change their mind , in a positive sort of way ... I liked the directors previous effort -LRB- Exorcism of Emily Rose -RRB- , but this one just has a good basic idea ... execution wise - very bad . I 'm seeing what he 's trying to achieve , unfortunately he fails convincing -LRB- actors fail too -RRB- . " ,3
" worst movie ever . This was a waste of time and a waste of good actors . I ca n't begin to say how stupid this was . If I could 've picked 0 stars I would have . Was this supposed to be a movie to scare you into treating the earth better ? Or was it just to meet some studio quota ? Did the actors owe the studio a movie in their contract so they said Okay I will be in this horrid movie , just write my check ? Please do n't waste your time on this drivel . Come on Keanu , you rocked in the Matrix , and what a waste of John Cleese . I wanted to scroll the credits to see if Will Smith was a producer and backed it so that his son could get his resume juiced up . Pitiful . " ,1
" Must ... go ... to ... McDonalds ... . I have no idea why , but since seeing this film I feel compelled to eat at McDonalds all the time . It 's odd because I hate their food . Not only that , but I have also purchased an LG mobile phone , a Citizen watch , a Honda car , and some desktop computer thingy by Microsoft . Seriously filmmakers . . product placement in big budget films is offensive . If you 're going to have sponsors , the film should be free to watch . There is a saying along the lines of where commerce grows , art and culture die on the vine . . and that was definitely true here . The film lost credibility for me when the camera lovingly caught the reflection of the golden arches in the windscreen , and Jennifer Connolly refrained McDonalds ? I 'm sorry , is this intermission ? Is Klaatu going to tell me there is popcorn available in the lobby ?? " ,4
" One of the Worst of 2008 . I went into this movie with a completely open mind . I do n't usually get into alien movies , but I knew this was based on a classic and the special effects looked good , so I told me brother I would go see it with him . I was right about one thing ; the special effects are phenomenal . That alone gave these movie a three out of ten in my book . The rest of this film was absolutely dreadful . The story may have been relevant in 1951 , but it does not hold up . The acting was mediocre at best , though Keanu Reeves playing a robot-like alien is probably a great casting choice , as every character he does seems pretty robotic . Jennifer Connelly is a fine actress , but only so much can be done with a script like this . Same goes for John Hamm ; I like him , but the script was just horrid and brought everyone down . So to conclude , this movie is complete garbage , easily the worst I have seen in quite some time . If the special effects were n't as good as they are , then this film would be a complete waste -LRB- though they are not good enough to warrant the $ 9 admission price -RRB- . " ,3
" Sci-fi remake that just preaches and little entertains . Keanu Reeves , to his detractors , is quite a one-dimensional actor and would best fit the role of a robot . Cruel point , but in keeping with that idea , he seems to then be well placed as an alien who has come to earth in a human body to warn of impending doom due to mankind 's folies . The film is a re-make of a sci-fi classic , and many fans will not take too kindly to the changes to this new version -LRB- or simply to the reasoning that it has been remade -RRB- . Regardless , you do n't have to go as far as that to dislike this film . The story is very preachy and never holds your attention for long , where really we already know the points being made , and this film wo n't be making the impact to generate discussion as maybe the scriptwriters had hoped -LRB- there have been better vehicles for that -RRB- . Acting wise , there is little for anyone to be stretched . Jennifer Connelly , as the lone mother and scientist , is the main central `` human '' character and does a fair job with her part . The special effects are fine but its not enough to make you want to watch this more than any other special effects spectacular . To be honest , there is little more to be said about this film . Personally , I think that if anything people should just leave this film alone , maybe just wait till it comes on the television . Could have been a lot better but it is n't . Disappointing movie . " ,4
" Do n't expect anything and then ... you might just like it . . The movie makes you re-realize the fact that people have multiple sides to their personalities . I consider it an overkill to put forth this thought with so much science fiction . In addition , one might expect the movie to talk about doomsday , throw some light on the the predictions made for 2012 Apocalypse ... but none of that is in the movie . I like the special effects ... very neat . specially the idea of nano robots , and super powerful genetic robot that can decompose into a billion nano robots . In short ... watch it if u have no expectations . In terms of the characters , you may not be impressed with any of them . The actors did not have a lot of room . Reeves could have added some touch to the character he played , but guess he was also confused about what this alien was actually as a person . There are chances that you may not like this flick even in case you like sci-fi movies . " ,4
" Johnny Mnemonic Bad . This movie is Johnny Mnemonic bad . It may keep a seven year old entertained . If you are going to do a remake , it should fairly easy to lift the script from the original movie and substitute special effects for any sort of thoughtful commentary . They even made John Clease unfunny . The last time I was this disappointed with a movie is when in Eyes Wide Shut Stanly Kubrick made a scene in which Nicole Kidman was naked . It should have been great . It was boring . He managed to suck all of the interesting bits out . In this movie it was the same . Save your money . Watch this film when it comes out on Comcast On Demand , use Picture in Picture with this movie in the smaller frame . In the larger frame watch something with some better commentary on the human condition like ... The Signal written by David Bruckner and Jacob Gentry . The Signal is interesting and entertaining at 1\/100th the budget . " ,2
" This is one of those films that make you think `` Damn it , I could have been cleaning the toilet '' ... Even if the toilet was clean . . This was one bad movie . I had goosebumps all over due to how silly the dialog was in some scenes . The Hollywood clich s were all there and the storyline was cheap . No surprising twists , just easily predictable garbage . I do n't understand why Jennifer and Keanu signed up for this . I really do n't . At some point when making a film . . Why is n't there someone who stands up and says . . `` Hey guys . . This is just . . a REALLY REALLY bad idea ! '' ??? Actually , there 's a simple answer to that question . Money . It 's always about money . Success in Hollywood is not making a good film . It 's about making a film people will go and see . At least in most cases . And this film here is an excellent example of that . And if you really HAVE TO do product placements ... You filthy filthy film makers ... Make sure it 's something OTHER THAN Windows Vista . For the love of Goooood ! " ,3
" Remake a disappointment . I agree that the remake is but a pale shadow of the original . The remake had such great potential , mainly wasted . Unfortunately , the various key problems prompting Klaatu 's arrival are n't actually mentioned . The enlightenment - that could have come in response to the displayed desire to kill something that is n't understood - was barely touched on . The hero does n't leave a powerful statement to the world before departing , as the original film 's hero did . This film gives the impression that the project was put in the hands of people who did n't think about it very much ; who did n't realize the potential the film had to create wonderment and inspiration . What a pity . " ,3
" Weak remake of a classic movie . Watched this movie today and I only have one opinion : a total waste of time . Bad direction , bad effects , bad acting . Changed the original film but centered in the same ideia but weaked realized . The original 1951 film is classic . I watched since I was a kid and ever became impressed even with the special effects . In this remake the ship is strange and bad looking . The robot which brought a suspense in the original now in this remake give some shots and becames a cloud of insects -LRB- from where come this ideia ? -RRB- . The end is patetic and abrupt . The main actor is sensational but in this movie is weak . Ever actor is weak and there is not combination between them . Run away from this movie and save some money . " ,3
" A complete mess ... . Rarely have I seen a big-budget movie that was as bland , predictable and shoddily put together as ` The Day the Earth Stood Still ' . I have not seen the black-and-white original from the 50s , but in comparison to this remake it must be an utter thrill-ride . Almost every actor manages to embarrass him - or herself in this mess of a movie . Keanu Reeves is as wooden as Gort , the faceless robot at his side - but at least his character is supposed to be an emotionless alien - the rest of the cast has no such excuse . Jennifer Connelly , talented and beautiful as she is , is stuck in the same absent-minded , weepy-eyed rut she has been in for most of her recent performances . She is supposed to be the main active character of the story but ends up as a seemingly passive spectator . Bates is so robotic in the delivery of her lines you almost suspect her to be revealed as an android in the movie . The plot is riddled with holes big enough to fly a spaceship through them , the dialog is trivial , as are the emotions of the lead characters . All suspension of disbelief aside - I doubt a supremely advanced alien being will be convinced to overturn an important intergalactic plan thousands of years in the making after having a cup of tea with a nice old biologist -LRB- a miscast John Cleese -RRB- and witnessing a few tears from a mother and child . The direction borders on the incompetent , the sets are drab , gray and uninspiring and overall the movie has a sense of miniature scale when in fact it is advertised as a bombastic science fiction drama . Finally , the special effects are among the worst I have seen in a big-budget production to date . Utterly lifeless , regurgitated and decidedly non-frightening . Save your money and seek out some well-produced and more thought-provoking science fiction material instead of risking to be dumbed down by this tripe . A major disappointment . " ,2
" Intelligent Race . . ??? ... Hardly With This Movie . Comment Edit ... Come on everyone ... even if you 'd never seen the original , this is one of the worst movies ever made . Inconsistencies , confusing plot , no real story line , miscast actors , etc. . Sure we all love the original , but this stinker would be a loser even if it was n't a remake . The only reason it is tops at the box office is because of the hype and it was opened in more theaters than any movie in history . Even Fox and the producers realize they have to get every penny they can as fast as they can , because in just another day or so ... NO ONE WILL BE WATCHING THIS MOVIE . Ms. Bates , Ms. Connelly , and Mr. Reeves should be ashamed of their participation in this farce that is trying to be passed off as entertainment . All I can figure is you did this film for money only with no pride of final result ... that or you thought jumping on the current trend of `` let 's save the earth '' movies might be of some use to the public . Director Scott Derrickson should think of another profession if this is the type product he thinks the public wants to see . And poor Jaden Smith ... only 10 years old and he has to be associated with a film like this . I send this message out to the actors , director , and producers of this film ... I WANT MY MONEY BACK . Trust me ... this is not what the American public wants to see . Besides the fact this movie destroys the quality of and social message in the Robert Wise original ... it provided no story line or message at all . One of the things history has proved is that hard economic times do n't seem to affect the movie industry . The public likes movies and use them as an escape from tough times . Watching congressional bail-out debates on C-SPAN would have been more entertaining than this loser . This POS is apparently being opened in more theaters than any other film in history , and also broadcast toward Alpha Centauri . Let 's hope if we do have any neighbors out there that they do n't intercept this one ... they 'll put an interstellar quarantine around our system and the requisite `` No Signs of Intelligent Life '' message with a recommended detour to bypass our planet . I beg and implore every theater out there ... do not sell tickets to anyone for this film ... take it off your marquee immediately . You 'll have to take it off in a day or so anyway . " ,1
" Klaatu Badmovie Dontgo . 99 words or less -LRB- oh well , 232 -RRB- : Early on in this remake of the Robert Wise movie of 1951 , a mysterious motorcade arrives to whisk the scientist-heroine away . She -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- repeatedly asks what 's going on , and is told repeatedly , `` All will be explained en route '' . But , you know , that never happens . That kind of sums up my movie-going experience here . This movie tries too hard to do too many things . It tries to respect the expectation of the fans of the original . It tries to update the story from the folly of the Cold War to the folly of environmental destruction . It tries to reconcile the strained relationship between mother and son . And , it tries to be original . It fails on all counts . Even if you accept the inane story line - no spoiler here , it 's in the trailer : `` If the Earth dies , you die . If you die , the Earth survives . '' Get it ? - the script and direction are too weak to pull it off . The CG work is competent and fun to watch . Fans of the first movie may get a kick out of the re-invention of Gort , the robot , with his name finally explained . If you want to watch a great movie , rent the original , oh and make it a double feature with `` Forbidden Planet . '' If you want an evening of B-movies that are fun to laugh at , rent this remake along with `` Johnny Mnemonic '' . " ,4
" Does n't even stack up to the original . Now , put the times aside and look at the whole basis of the film - alien comes to earth , gets shot by jittery soldier , miraculously heals then proceeds to tell the U.S. Military leadership that it is imperative that he speak to the World Leaders . That 's the jist , but then it just falls short in the new 2008 version . The story does n't follow the same line , the characters are nothing like the originals , and not having read the short story but seen the original several times , ends completely different . First off that bugged me was Jacob , Helen 's `` step son , '' in the original he fell in love with Klaatu -LRB- although not suspected of being an alien until later - which they did a horrible job with that twist in the re-make as well -RRB- , in the remake he despises and want 's someone to kill Klaatu . And you 'll know it when you see it , but GORT was done horribly , especially his destructive force and not to mention he was never talked about or referred to as GORT by Klaatu . Finally , the worst possible part , was in the original , Klaatu came to earth to warn of the Robots designed and programmed to enforce peace that if earth continued it 's destruction and violence the world would be destroyed , a very good moral point , the new one , there was n't even a chance at a warning , and it seemed our fate was decided before the `` spheres '' even arrived -LRB- which I get the whole new age style on sci-fi spaceships , but c'mon , the original picked on the whole UFO\/Flying Saucer craze , they could have been a little better in this one that just big globes that looked like they were full of smoke -RRB- . Now - as a stand alone sci-fi movie , this was n't really THAT bad . It had an okay plot if you totally disregard the original , and it was the perfect role for Reeves , blank , emotionless , and serious the whole time - on purpose . If you do n't mind all the jumping around and making the U.S. Government look like a bunch of war mongers then you should get some satisfaction , but wait for the DVD , it 's really not the best movie ever and it wo n't ever win an award or be held in high regard in the sci-fi realm along side greats like War of The Worlds , Alien , Aliens , Predator , and yes , even Independence Day . But for clich 's sake - I 've seen better . " ,4
" Disappointed To The Max . Ruining a classic should be against the law . Fox ... shame on you . I 've waited anxiously for years for the right studio , director , and cast to creatively set out and make a better `` TDTESS . '' What with the immense ability to do FX 's and CGI it could have been a great undertaking that , thru talented artists , a masterpiece could have developed . Not even close . Fox ... you dropped the ball I 'm sad to say . Perhaps it is true what many Sci-Fi fans insist . Great remakes are few and rare . After today 's waste of time money I have to agree . Now let 's talk about the flaws . Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring . What ever you were paid it was undeserved . The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision . Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original . Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film . It is very much like the way the 51 ' movie portrayed them . Gort -LRB- the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world -RRB- fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved . Finally , the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit . There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly . She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character . Wil Smith 's son just gets a C + and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes . What I 've learned now is ... Do n't get your hopes up . It just ai n't worth it . By the way . Ron Howard would have delivered on the goods had he been given the chance to remake this classic . Even Speilburg would have shown the way . " ,3
" Monty Python 's Flying Circus is full of garbage . The opening titles give a warning when it says that John Cleese is one the players He should stick to slapstick comedy as not only is this movie an embarrassment but so is his presence in it . Kathy Bates is also excruciatingly bad playing the USA Secretary of State . By these standards they should have cast Pee Wee Herman as the US President.Dear oh dear . What else is wrong with the film , well where to start : 1 . The story is ludicrous about UF0 spheres landing on earth to save the earth but not the people ; 2 . The acting is half hearted and atrocious from top to bottom and all the actors simply look like they are going through the motions ; 3 . The direction is poor ; 4 . K. Reeves acts as if he would prefer to be elsewhere and really should get out of the closet ; 5 . Miss Connelly , sorry dear , your nose looks similar to something out of Pinnochio , and : 6 . You pretend madam to have a brain in the film but even if you do have one it was not apparent in this movie ; 7 . The film tries to be politically correct but all it does is irritate anyone with any sense ; 8 . The Budget for the film is given as 80 million and quite frankly that is a complete and utter mis-spending of so much money . Do I need to go on ? Why did I waste my life and my time on this total garbage : 1\/10 . " ,1
" Sorry I spent the money . I liked Gort until he turned into a bunch of metallic bugs . The plot was awful . I think it was written by Al Gore . Did not hold true to the original at all , with the exceptions being : he landed in DC , the names were the same , and Gort looked very similar -LRB- but was taller -RRB- . Environmental wackos will love it . Some of the special effects were good , and I think Keanu did a good acting job . Beyond that it was very disappointing . I have never been so tempted to ask for a refund . The movie starts out very well , but about midway quickly becomes a statement for environmental wacko political positions . I wanted to see a science fiction movie , not read some liberal web site . " ,3
" The sad outcome of a good idea . First of all : I did watch about half of the original . I found it a very engaging idea , but , born in the late eighties and grown up with cgi suspended blockbusters i found it hard to watch . Given this the idea to take a great script , color it , give it the latest effects and some of the best actors -LRB- taken Keanu Reeves is great if it comes to being some sort of sci-fi hero -RRB- is nearly perfect . I mean you ca n't do wrong with it . That was my bet . And even if i feared the newer version would happen to be some family movie version i guessed it would at least be intelligent and entertaining . Failed . Fair enough : The effects when it comes to destroying some symbols of humankind are overwhelming but 28 weeks later made a similar impression by having only a guerrilla team and some amateurs doing a rough epilogue -LRB- which worked just as nicely and felt somewhat better -RRB- Keanu reeves and his female collaborator do their best to keep us awake . And Reeves is completely engaging seeming willing to learn but still restricted to rational , non-emotional reactions . But now for the mistakes : The complete story and meaning is reduced to some short sentences , poorly written and hardly constructing some complex background . The officials , intelligence , scientists , military reacts unconvincing , dumb and slow . I mean who would not guess what the sphere was doing about 20 minutes before the movie made one of the people in control recognize it ?! The artwork is a poor mix of 50s charm and 21st century design . The almighty robot looks like some 60 years old design which i liked first , but having to watch some tasteless flowing lights under it 's surface i disliked it . Nothing fits together rightly . Surfaces look wrong -LRB- and this is not some alien , sci-fi meaning of wrong -RRB- and you have an amount of nebula objects only star trek could justify . The end is unconvincing , hastily done and somewhat rough I left the cinema feeling like i just watched some mildly entertaining afternoon comedy i could hardly remember . This movie neither leaves a lasting expression nor changes your mind over anything . And now for the worst . I am not the kind of person who is open for advertisement . I hardly remember the product a good ad tries to sell me but rather it 's soundtrack . I do n't even recognize labels in James Bond . But this movie had that much ads which just did not fit in in any sort of way that i was short of throwing up . First of all the scientists and the American government use windows , which might very well be given the sort of government America seems bound to , but please i never ever want to see that damn vista logo filling nearly the whole screen . Second the stupid lg handy which falls out of the girls bag when she packs and is put back in a moment for no reason or anything , but we all can see she uses LG Last of all : I did dislike that stupid , annoying , unconvincing little brat that much i nearly left the cinema ! " ,3
" The Day the Face Stood Still - Directors 's Emotionless Version . There can be no argument that the original 1951 film with Michael Rennie is a Classic . Besides freezing post war DC forever in celluloid , it was also post war in attitude . War is awful , ugly and violent and will lead to the complete destruction of human life on earth . It was a clear message summed up by Klaatu 's last words at the end of the movie . I mention the earlier movie to help illustrate what is wrong with the remake . Once again , if the viewer does not connect with characters than the viewer will not care what happens to those characters . Even with his stone face , Michael Rennie , by nuance of voice and expression could convey a range of emotions and the viewer connects with him throughout the original movie . Keanu Reeves , either by choice or direction , conveys nothing while leaving one with the impression that there is nothing more behind those bland eyes to convey . The young boy , Jaden Smith , is presented as this angry little genius who is so much smarter than the adults -LRB- evidently from birth -RRB- and displays none of the reactions one would normally see in a child of his age . Jennifer Connelly , who has done some excellent work in other films , is not allowed to use that talent in this film . One would at least expect some unintentional humor , given Keanu 's deadpan performance , but even this is absent . Other than a bare storyline , this remake bears no resemblance to the original movie or to the original short story `` Farewell to the Master '' by Harry Bates . Director Scott Derrickson dropped the ball on this one - big time . My feeling here is that the producers wanted to grab the fans of the classic film and create new fans with eye-popping CG and they achieved that much , the movie should make money . This movie will be forgotten faster than Karl Rove , so it is hard to recommend even as a DVD release . What a waste of time and money - not the first movie to do this and certainly not the last . " ,3
" A good movie and well worth seeing . After reading all the negative reviews from critics and viewers , I almost did n't go and see it . However , I 'm really glad I did as the special effects , story line , and acting were well worth it . It deviated from the original movie story line , however , this movie should be seen as a `` stand alone '' movie and not compared to the original . Some of the critiques wrote that Keanu Reeves showed no emotion and was stiff in his acting , however I do n't think he would have been believable as an alien had he acted any other way . Kathy Bates and Jennifer Connelly were excellent in their parts , and even the little boy played a good -LRB- if not a little corny -RRB- role . The only disappointment was in the ending when the globe-shaped space ship left without the warning to earth that `` man must change or be destroyed '' as depicted in the original movie . " ,8
" I loved the whole movie ... though the other reviews were n't useful at the end . I do n't understand what ppl want out of a movie . When you come up with the good message ppl say who asked for a message we want entertainment.when a entertainment flick is made they say it pointless . To me a good movie is when you forget how the 2 hrs was spent . I went for this movie with 3 of my friends . All of us like the movies pace . We never had time to think of whats wrong whats right.Excellent time pass if that is what we watch movies for.The gort was made into those tiny dust kinda things to resemble flood ... to look like doomsday ... thats pretty smart commercial thinking though a debatable one . I say the movie rocks please go watch the movie ... ... withh all your friends . You wont be disappointed.This is one of those movie which ppl rate really low but you will find it fun to watch " ,8
" Earth did n't stand still , it laughed its butt off !!!!!!!! . Are you kidding me !!!!! Here we go again . Just like In that horrible movie , ` The Lost World : Jurassic Park -LRB- 1997 -RRB- ' you had Jeff Goldblum show up on screen as the father of a black daughter with no rhyme or reason at all , other than to annoy and insult every black person in the audience . Fast forward to 2008 . Now we have Jennifer Connelly wondering around this movie with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett 's son , both longing for this dead Blackman . If the producers and director want to be daring and bold , let 's see Jennifer Connelly making love to this mysterious black man in a flashback on screen for everyone to see or have a Blackman wondering about the movie with a little annoying white boy ! The original classic was a Cold War Nuclear warning ; `` to be careful of what you 're doing to this planet and each other and if you ca n't change your nature as human beings and how you treat each other , then they would eliminate the human race '' . The film was n't about the little boy ! In this day of nuclear uncertainty and random terrorism , you had a chance to update that message of real fear in today 's world . But one thing got in the way , Hollywood and do me a favor ! I see the producers ; writers and director are doing a remake of Alfred Hitchcock 's 1963 thriller , The Birds . Wow , I ca n't wait to see how they screw that classic up ! " ,1
" Brilliant . Whoever decided to cast Keanu Reeves -LRB- the second worst actor ever -RRB- and Jeniffer Connaly -LRB- the worst actress to ever win an Oscar -RRB- was brilliant . They were each as bland and uninspiring as the other ; they could not have provided more contrast to the lack of talents of the other . The script was horrible . Predictable . Boring . I was hoping for good special effects , but ... no . Will Smith 's kid was unfortunately affected by the performance-sucking attributes of his adult headliners . Kathy Bates lowered herself to this role . I -LRB- having been a former intelligence officer in the US government -RRB- laughed out loud when we got to see supersonic Predator drones zooming into NYC 's Central Park to fire Sidewinder missiles at `` the Sphere '' . Predators do n't carry sidewinders and they travel at a top speed akin to the 80 's automobile sensation `` Yugo '' . This movie sucked . Keanu Reeves continued his spiral into performance hell and whoever vomited the screenplay for this bit of tripe should be flogged . " ,2
" WORSt film ever . From beginning to end the whole film did n't seem to flow one bit . It was 1 -RRB- Boring 2 -RRB- The most rubbish graphics I have ever seen especially with the whole earth and light scene . A two year old could have created better story line . I understand it 's a re-make from the original but it was just terrible . Two hours of my time was wasted and the best bit was when the film ended . All the way through there would be random scenes which did n't make any sense to what had just happened a couple of minute ago . All the way through it lacked any sense of action . . meaning or just plan simple a good story line . The actors did their best but not much can be said about the producers who created it . The icing on the cake was when they made this so dull and so predictable way of making the `` alien '' feel sad was the whole crying sense . By the time that scene came I had wished i had left a long time ago . So moral of the story is this was by far the WORST MOVIE I have ever seen , do n't be fouled by the 6.2 rating that it has been given . If u do watch it ... I only hoped you had read this before you had . I want my money back . " ,1
" I did n't fall asleep , but I almost did ... . The movie had some good special effects , but in this day age for this type of movie that 's little get get excited about . Unfortunately the first 20 minutes or so had the makings of something good and I started out interested . Unfortunately after the first 20 minutes , the entire thing became a let down and rather dull . The plot was very obvious , no twists or turns , nothing really original here -LRB- yes I realize it was based loosely off an older story -RRB- . The music , acting dialog was rather forgettable . Pretty much by the end I was just waiting for this thing to end so I could leave . There was really nothing memorable at all about this film . The vote of 2 was mainly because there are obviously worse movies out there , so that was the bar here . I would not recommend seeing this in the theater as there 's really nothing this film offers as far as the big screen . I hesitate to say wait for it to come out on DVD as again it was pretty much a waste of time . For me I 'm a sci-fi buff , into aliens , invasion movies , so this should have been right up my ally , yet I almost fell asleep . Only reason I did n't was cause someone behind me kept coughing loudly ... " ,2
" The Day the Earth Stood Still Again . -LRB- Contains spoilers in closing -RRB- I recently reviewed the original `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' and boy , with any of its flaws , I would thoroughly recommend -LRB- and watch -RRB- any day over this `` re-imagining '' in 2008 . Beyond its promising opening act leading into the interrogation scene , the rest is just flat out crap . If I were Klaatu , and this was my first\/only trip to -LRB- whoever 's -RRB- Earth , and these were the people I met along the way , I surely would 've destroyed all mankind as well . Starting with Will Smith 's son , or at least the character he portrays -LRB- I would 've anyways for that hideous hairdo -RRB- . All the fear , hatred , rebellion is knocked right out of him in a split second scene on a bridge , where suddenly he 's friends with the alien that just killed several humans the reason in the first place the boy is afraid and wants the alien dead . As for Keanu Reeves , simply the worst actor in history , he really was n't the problem . In fact , aside from `` Bill Ted , '' this seemed to be a perfect role for him . -LRB- Although , I previously wrote he should 've played GORT as that 's as far as his acting range lies . -RRB- Once again we 're served with the sermon on going green , such as the similarly titled `` The Day After Tomorrow , '' the latest Bond movie `` Quantum of Solace '' or the retched `` The Happening . '' And once again , we 're -LRB- supposedly -RRB- taught that humans are worth saving and we can \* change \* . Earlier in 2008 , in `` Diary of the Dead , '' the final line read something like : `` But are we really worth saving ? '' After viewing any of the morons in this film , you must simply state no , agree with Klaatu -LRB- 's original mission -RRB- and help lead the destruction of the Earthlings . -LRB- Spoiler Alert The final scene , where Earth finally does stand still , or at least the technology , seems like an afterthought and just thrown in because they used the same title . And if you were trying to remember the feeling you got in the original where Helen was to shout the command : `` Gort ! Klaatu barada nikto ! '' you might as well just re-watch the original it 's gone from this film . -RRB- " ,1
" First 20 min was good , then it got just stupid ... . How do Hollywood executives look at a script this bad , or worse , post production rough cuts , and decide to keep throwing 10s of millions of $ $ at a project ? I mean really , this thing started off really well . I few plot holes and stuff that bugs the scientist out there , but forgivable . But then you add in a kid who ANY of us would just have hit at about 6 points , a 1000 year old -LRB- at least -RRB- alien who falls in love with humanity after only a few decades , an all powerful robot that has about 3 minuets of screen time -LRB- ????? -RRB- , and an ending ... well ... sort of an ending as it just sort of stopped and the credits rolled , and you have a recipe for flat out disaster . And I bet it will be if not already . If you have cable or sat wait for it for free on HBO , or spend $ 5 on it at wall mart when it hits the bargain bin in March . I am sorry , but looking at Scott Derrickson -LRB- directors -RRB- previous movies , you have to wonder who in Hollywood opened their wallet for this in the first place . " ,1
" `` Earth '' trudges toward finish line . `` Earth '' is a very sincere , but plodding cautionary tale about the impending likelihood of do-gooder aliens holding an intervention for Earth . Concern for the planet is popular again and we 've gotten a slew of films this year to prove it from the compulsively watchable , but goofy `` The Happening '' to the superb `` Wall E. '' I appreciate the intent of these films in an age where we are treating the Earth as if it is expendable and conservation is considered unpatriotic , but the intent of `` Earth '' was not enough to save it from a thin script and stiff lead performance by Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu . In the movie , GORT is the automaton and Klaatu is autonomous , but Reeves is out to convince you otherwise . The film starts out promisingly enough as an impending emergency leads to the forceful removal of astro-biologist Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- from her home by the Feds . She is sequestered to a military compound where soldiers and scientists are gathering to attempt to avert a likely disaster . But as the film settles in , we begin to find out that this story is going to hinge on the relationship between Helen and her estranged stepson Jacob -LRB- played by Will Smith 's son Jaden -RRB- . This is n't really all that compelling as the two do n't have insurmountable problems to begin with . Klaatu will be their therapist and as helicopters explode and GORT revs up for destruction , Helen and Jacob hash it out in a tame , reasonable manner . When GORT unleashes his fury , the film has some fun . But it 's a fakey CGI fun reminiscent of the scarab attacks in the recent Mummy . Though the stakes are huge in this story -- the survival of the Earth -- the film never successfully creates a sense of impending doom . The army acts in predictable ways and is continually foiled by the aliens in a timeworn fashion . Kathy Bates as the Secretary of Defense is in charge of the US response and she seems only mildly perturbed by the crisis . This film is guilty of going through the motions , taking us nowhere new , and lacking a pulse . A predictable , slumping movie that trudges along to the finish line . " ,4
" Amazing , Awe-Inspiring , Deep , and Intelligent . I had n't known about TDTESS that long , maybe only a couple months . I was somewhat curious about it because I had heard of the original 50s one -LRB- I mean , who has n't ? -RRB- . A few weeks ago I began seeing TV ads for it , which were the first clips of the film I had seen yet , and got a little excited , because there was something about it that seemed awesome . The beginning confused me a bit at first , but I eventually figured it out the next morning . Things got a little bit more interesting and exciting as the story continued on after that , with the impending `` encounter '' . Something about it seemed real , with the panic and confusion in the first part of the film . And then Klaatu makes his first appearance . I absolutely loved when a shot is fired and hits him , and the giant `` thing '' -LRB- for lack of a better word -RRB- reacts and tries to protect him -LRB- which Klaatu later explains , it was protecting him and only reacts in the presence of violence -RRB- . Another great part of the film happens soon after , when he has his full human form , and the female protagonist and other scientists are gathered around him in some `` recovery room '' , while the woman representing the president interrogates him with questions . You can definitely feel the alien 's initial fear and awkwardness in the scene -LRB- I mean , who would n't be afraid if you were on another planet being surrounded by aliens while they poked and prodded you -RRB- . I love the line later on when the female protagonist asks him , `` What were you before ? '' , and Klaatu replies `` It would only frighten you '' . It 's just wonderful lines like this that make the film a real treat . Reeves certainly has an otherworldly presence in the film . I would almost say he has a `` dark '' aspect to his character . He shows virtually no emotion , and not one smile . That 's not to say he 's a robot on screen ; he 's anything but . But it 's a wonderful transgression to see him eventually care about the female protagonist and her son . I also found his `` abilities '' to be particularly awesome , as he seems to just do things with his mind . I think this has something to do with the fact he `` looks '' human ; it 's that fact alone you connect to him more . If he looked like some sort of monster , it just would n't work . All in all , he 's just wonderful to watch in the film . One thing that is stated in the film is the destructive and violent nature of the human race , and it 's 100 % true . Maybe some people ca n't handle hearing that , as I came across some thread titles along the lines of `` environmentalist rubbish '' and such . This is the only home we have , and if we start killing off more species and slowly ruining the delicate balance called `` nature '' -LRB- animal and plant life in nature are like kegs in a clockwork ; without the kegs , the clock ceases to function -RRB- , or adding more toxic crap to the atmosphere , well then you can just say goodbye to the wonderful planet called Earth . I guess it seems like this film struck something in me . There was just something amazing , awe-inspiring , deep , and intelligent about it . It 's such a shame that today 's audience can only accept the garbage that is immature , grossly perverted , and filled with mindless action and gore -LRB- gore can be an exception in some movies , but in most it only serves as a `` teen magnet '' -RRB- . A film like this is a priceless rarity . " ,8
" A nice Si-Fi Movie . This movie is a pure SI-FI film . there is n't much action if you expecting that , it 's not similar to war of the worlds . its a really nice movie with a solid story and good acting , except the little kid -LRB- will Smith 's son -RRB- he is an awful actor . it certainly good have been better with more action and making the movie a bit longer . Over all it 's a good movie for someone with an open mind and imaginative . if you not into SI-FI do n't watch it because you wont like it . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , " ,8
" Pitiful attempt at a remake . I have to admit , i have a very poor record in picking good films . Almost every film i think will be good turns out to be a complete lemon , and , since i 'd been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i saw the first trailer you can pretty much guess what is coming up next ... This film is pitiful . The original film was a joy to watch . In fact , i dug it out last week and watched it again just so i would be able to compare the films , and i was glued to my seat the whole way though . Unfortunately i ca n't say the same for the remake . The opening starts off with an interesting twist on the origins of Klatu , but still feels pretty weak , and then moves into the present day where we find out an object is about to strike the earth at a colossal speed . Quite why this required the rounding up of all the top scientists to be flown to the impact site \* before \* the object that is expected to reduce everything to dust actually hits was never explained , and it set the scene for the first in a long line of weak , disjointed , and poorly thought out plot lines . Reeves as Klatu has none of the warmth of the original character . Maybe this was deliberate , or , as i suspect , it 's because Reeves ca n't act . Either way , it resulted in a character that was impossible to identify with , and left me not caring at all if he lived or died . I was also very disappointed in the child 's character . The original is full of wonder and awe for the world , whereas this child is a whimpering brat who does n't really bring anything new to the film . On the plus side i did like the robot GORT , although again , the plot let this character down , and having the American Military creating the name for him was ridiculous , as were the silicon based locusts that devour everything . All in all very disappointing . Another tribute to Hollywoods love of special effects over substance . " ,3
" A bid letdown for any fan of the original . My wife and I went to see this on the first day of release . We had watched the original at the 25th Annual 24 Hour Science Fiction Marathon earlier this year , and it had reminded me of how much I liked the original . -LRB- which stands the test of time quite well -RRB- I did n't want to get my hopes up too much for this one , and was just hoping for it to have a coherent plot and decent special effects . I ended up rather disappointed in many respects . My gut feeling after watching this movie was that it was just a waste of time politically correct bunch of drivel . In a nutshell , the writer wants us to all agree that if another species on earth goes extinct , we should all feel that humanity should die in order to preserve all of the little critters on Earth . The dumbest part of the movie is that evidently the destruction of our technology is supposed to accomplish this . Technology has allowed a great increase in population , but has also at the same time slowly been bringing down barriers to tackling some of the very same ecological problems that the film brings up . If the world governments collapse , and we all go back to burning coal and trees to stay warm , does anybody really believe we are going to make solving ecological issues a primary concern ? I did n't think so . As someone who graduated with a BS in Environmental Studies , I would have hoped that the people who made this film would have been a bit more grounded in reality . Also , a big disappointment for me was that the famous line from the original did not appear to be uttered during the movie . " ,1
" Keannu Klaatu Kick Ass . I just love keannu Reeves . . his acting is superb . . make me thought its another Matrix Movie kind of acting . . Cool and Mysterious . . in some way . . And Jeniffer Conelly ... is awesome too . . BUT ... The others ... seriously ... starting with the kid . . remind me of war of the worlds where it has the same feel ... those kids are really annoying ... If it was n't ... for KR and JC and his super robot . . plus the Dialogs . . where KR are in it ... this movie is going to be a let down . . I watch them at the movies yesterday -LRB- 11.12.2008 -RRB- . i really enjoyed all the special effects . . and there are new ways . . to doom all of us . . with such creativity . For me personally ... it was entertaining ... but not the ending . . where i think . . the producers must have been out of budget . . too short . Is this an episode . . ? BTW ... Keannu and his cyclop Robot . . Kick Ass . . 3 vote for KR . .2 vote for JC and 2 vote for the robot . makes it 7 . " ,7
" I love the spacial effects . The plot is nothing and a bit weak . . This comment contains the whole plot of the movie . Well , the story can be summed up into two sentences . The story is about the aliens come to restore the earth by get rid of human since there are only a few planets that life forms can inhabit . It turns out that the alien found good in human , which I do not know from the movie what good he find - __________ - '' The plot is simple . The story is not strong in the point that why the alien changed his mind not to get rid of human and there is no climax for me . There should be more evidences of how humans are good or even at least a little love affair in the story . I think I expected something like ID4 , War of the World or Transformer . It turns out that this movie is kind of a weak drama and a weak action . The special effects are not such a fancy work but it is beautiful . I like the sphere and the robot . " ,8
" updated special effect , but lost the original message . i saw the movie in HK yesterday Well i am disappointed The best thing about the original was when Klaatu make his warning speech to the entire world and stop the world as a warning message . But in this version , Klaatu was not allow to speak to Representatives of entire world.so the process to destroy the human race started . In the end Klaatu gave the earth one last chance and stop all the machine on Earth as his warning massage . But the message is not as clear as his speech of original movie . Would the Worldleader get the message ? and would they dismiss the stop of machine as some EMP side affect . The movie remind me of Jeff Bridges 's movie `` Starman '' , an Earth woman and an alien running from the government.without the love relationship . Klaatu 's change of heart was because he saw the other side of humanity . If he was able to form a deeper relationship with Jennifer Connelly 's character , then at least the movies can be a alien \/ human love movies . But it was not that kind of movies either , it is sort of between Sci-fi movies with environmental message . " ,3
" Very disappointed ! . The disappointment I had , was that I was not disappointed at all by this movie . I think I do understand why I was not disappointed . I have not seen the original from 1951 and have not read the short story from Harry Bates . And by the way , in the mean time I found out , that the 1951 version also was not too true to the short story . On the other hand , I have the need as well to sometimes being able to hold on to the things I have seen that I have appreciated beyond my usual appreciation . To me the most important message from this movie was the fact that we can change , as soon as we are on the edge of almost not being able to change at all whilst having the absolute need to change . This may not have been the intention of this movie . Still , consider it a marvelous spin off . As far as I can be considered a fan of anyone , I could be considered to be a fan of Keanu -LRB- ever since `` Bill Ted 's Excellent Adventure '' -RRB- . People who perceive that he does not show emotion are blind . Especially in this movie he shows the kind of emotion that totally fits the persona of Klaatu ... someone who is on a mission and needs to fulfill a target , while at the same time staying open to changes and with a totally clear manifestation of his own dilemma . To me , the kind of dilemma he faces can only be faced with a face -LRB- and posture -RRB- like that ! " ,10
" Do n't make me open my visor ... ! . Sometimes I think people write movie reviews just to dust off film lingo like `` mise en scene '' or `` milieu '' without getting bitch slapped , and\/or to heap clever abuse upon filmmakers and actors rather than offer any real analysis and criticism . Given , it is frequently in the nature of most online film reviews to be negative -- due to the anonymity of the criticism , and because the contrarian antithesis to the filmmaker 's thesis allows a faux ` creative ' indulgence for non - filmmakers -- and the abuse just piles on . This is especially true of classic remakes . Having read a number of reviews here of this 2008 remake of `` The Day the Earth Stood Still , '' I see this predictably playing itself out again . If Gort were here , he 'd open his visor and put an end to this vigilantism , or maybe unleash some nasty nanites into cyberspace to curb that most-aggressive of intergalactic species : the amateur film critic . Left to their own ferocity , they would subdue the world . I too was excited at the prospect of seeing this film remade . Then , having read some early reviews , I was expecting an apocalyptic melt-down of a disappointment . But I still went to the theater and now , having watched it during its premier general release here in the US , I was pleasantly surprised at what a really excellent remake this was . It 's no easy task to take a superb classic like this one and reintroduce it to audiences , and I think it speaks volumes about the gutsiness of the director and producers to pull this off . The point of remakes is never to make `` better '' films than the originals . -LRB- All films are locked to their times , even `` timeless '' ones . -RRB- Rather , the point is to uproot the salient qualities of the original story and then cultivate them for present-day audiences . Sometimes -- in fact , often - - what develops bears little resemblance to the original , as well it should . Whereas the original `` Day '' was largely about the Cold War , this newer version is about our planet and what we are doing to it . And frankly , it 's message is more important than ever . The majority of criticism against the film here at IMDb is that it was either not like the original , or that it was too similar . And while this may look like `` criticism , '' it is overly simplistic and does not challenge us -- nor filmmakers -- to dig for something more valuable . It is fascinating that three recent films with an environmental message -LRB- `` Inconvenient Truth , '' `` The Happening , '' and this one -RRB- have been gang-raped by corporate media critics . Besides the obvious insult to kleptocratic sponsors , could it be that relocating antagonists from the familiar realm of monsters , ghosts and silver-suited spacemen is just too unsettling for our twenty-first century psyches ? If so , then this is one of the redeeming qualities of this remake : it forces audiences to rethink just who the bad guy -LRB- s -RRB- are . Walt Kelly , whose 1970 poster for Earth Day stated , `` We have met the enemy and it is us , '' readily comes to mind . To the point : ignore all the naysayers out there who whine that this version is `` not like the original , '' or that is `` trying too hard to be like the original . '' Go see this remake of `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' with an open , unbiased mind , and enjoy it . No , it wo n't tell you what to think about the questions it unleashes , but it will provide a most satisfying movie-going experience and give you a very great deal to think upon . My one complaint -LRB- and the only reason I wo n't give it ten stars -RRB- : the last two lines in the film ! " ,9
" A clever , great movie . I loved this film . The plot is the greatest strength of this movie -LRB- I know it 's a remake -RRB- . Everyone should watch it and try to understand it . It 's more than a usual sci-fi , and has nothing to do with actionfilm -LRB- as many people thought -RRB- . So the first thing was the plot that I loved loved loved loved ... :-RRB- The next was the atmosphere . The visual world , and the sounds were really awesome . The sounds put me inside the movie , and made me feel that the characters felt . The actors were OK . They were n't the best , but they mostly showed what the story wanted . Reeves was perfect for this role I think . :-RRB- The funny thing is that , i ca n't remember the music ... maybe there was n't so much , or I was just too impressed by the story :-RRB- I 'll watch it again to find this out . And then again because I loved it :-RRB- . And I write it as an amateur film maker . A lot of people missed the action scenes ... maybe they ca n't think . I think they watch too many NoNameActionmovie 999 . on ChannelXZ . " ,9
" A Dead Fish . Well I went into the theater with high hopes and try as I might I could not maintain them . Kathy Bates was terribly miscast and the reactions of the military were not believable at all . Even so I tried to like this movie , and right up until the very end I thought that it was going to end up being an average movie but alas that was not to be the case . The ending was the worst slap in the face I have ever received from a science fiction movie . I felt like the director crept into the theater and spent the last two minutes of the movie beating me in the face with a half rotten salmon . Please someone take this directors union card away so his is not able to ruin any more classics ! " ,1
" Everyone Comparing To 1950 needs to RELAX ! . I 've never seen the 1950s version of this movie . However , just because I have never seen it does not mean my vote does n't count . Just hear me out . I think the movie was a good movie to just sit back , relax , and watch . It keeps you entertained , but with a message involved . From what I hear , the original keeps a message to the movie as well . I 've seen a lot of movies and this was not as bad as people are making it out to be . People have to understand that the 1950 's version was made 50 years ago . Come on people . Hollywood is running out of ideas . Therefore they decided to remake this movie with better special effects . Is that so bad ? You have to look at a movie in the eyes of people today , not back in the 50s . All I 'm saying is give this movie a chance and stop bashing on it so much . To be honest , after seeing this movie , I 'm curious to see what the original was like . In conclusion , to all the 1950s version lovers , this movie will make people wan na see the original . Go take a load off and watch a movie for what it is now , not what it used to be . Enjoy ! " ,8
" A very thought-provoking sci-fi remake . . Based on the book titled Farewell to the Master by Harry Bates , The Day The Earth Stood Still -LRB- both versions -RRB- is a well known story that points out a lot of things about life , mainly ourselves , like war and pollution . Now everyone knows the plot : the alien Klaatu , accompanied by his giant robot GORT , comes to to save the planet from ourselves . Obviously this movie is big on special effects which for the most part are pretty good , from the sphere-like ships to GORT himself . GORT really brings a sense of ominous dread to him , whether he 's attacking or just staring at the poor humans around him . Keanu Reeves is really good as Klaatu , his expressionless face and calm voice seem to fit the role , creating a mysterious atmosphere around him as great as his telepathic abilities . Everyone else is good , except for Jaden Smith who 's just annoying . John Cleese was great as the professor and his conversation with Klaatu about comparing humanity to Klaatu 's own race was just excellent . Overall , this movie is pretty realistic in terms of how we would react to a situation like this and its morals are substantial . I do recommend this to anyone who loves science fiction . " ,7
" Greater than the sum of its parts . . The Day the Earth Stood Still is by no means a cinematic masterpiece . As with any movie , plot holes are evident if you look for them . On the surface you have a sci-fi popcorn flick that is victim to many of the clich trappings of any alien-invades-earth-it 's - the-end-of-the-world film . What makes TDTESS different then is that at the heart of its convoluted and perhaps predictable script is a message about the human soul which should stay with you long after you 've forgotten the plot . The casting is brilliant , and the contrast between Jennifer Connelly 's delicate and vulnerable character and Keanu Reeve 's stoic demeanor is great to watch . The movie is an emotional one , but not due to its melodramatic scenes - and in my honest opinion these were probably the weaker points in the film - but due to what they say about the greater picture . I 've never seen the original and did n't go into the theater with any expectations . I was n't looking for cheap thrills or even dramatic storytelling . What I got was an idea , and an inspiring one . If you 've seen and enjoyed GATTACA or Dark City , you should definitely give this film a shot and go into it with a philosophical and open mind . From an artistic standpoint , the film makers could have done much more , but at the very least , I think we can appreciate the movie for what it tries to do . " ,7
" A decent movie . I feel this film got bad reviews over it 's depiction of the military in a time where the political rhetoric in the US and Canada is to , Support the Troops . However , as recent history dictates , generally the army will do what is asked of them regardless of what the personal opinions of the soldiers might be . Supporting the troops does n't necessarily mean supporting a war . Opposing an unreasonable war and demanding the troops be brought home is in fact supporting the individuals who are willing to sacrifice everything for the well-being of their nation 's people . Anyways , on to the actual movie review . For a science-fiction movie , I found this to be quite good actually . Recent news of Stephen Hawking saying that alien contact would likely mean colonization\/invasion is a perfect example of the kind fear people have about first contact with alien species that are far more advanced than us , and the reaction that humans might have . However , for obvious reasons it is sometimes hard to detect when Hawking is being sarcastic unless he would add , ha-ha-ha - ! One ca n't really expect too much from a film like this , the writing was pretty bare-bones , none of the characters were particularly meaty , roles , and the story was very fast paced and to the point -LRB- which is n't a bad thing -RRB- . Socio-politically I think the movie makes its point as a warning or reminder about humanity 's effect on the Earth . Given the time of the original 1951 film , it is more than understandable that humanity 's opinion of itself in general was pretty bleak . As in destroying each other is boiled down to human nature , and just accepting that . I personally believe people stand a chance against the potentiality to destroy itself , so long as a people can learn to control their baser emotions and take something of importance away from even the most horrific situations . I think if even someone as crazy as Kim Jong-Il can come around and say , Hey ... we really should just end the war . Because so long as the war remains , nuclear warfare is an inevitability , -LRB- paraphrasing of course -RRB- , then I think most other people can learn to be more mindful and driven to make humanity 's outlook an optimistic one . I know my review went a little off-the-rails , but this was what the movie made me think about . I would typically give a movie like this a 6 , but I gave it a 7 because I feel a lot of people were unfair with their reviews . Anyways , watch the movie , just do n't expect it to be a classic like , Close Encounters of the Third Kind , or , E.T. " ,7
" A + for special effects . It 's been a long time since I wrote a review . I have put off watching the 2008 adaptation of the 1951 movie The Day the Earth Stood Still . I loved the 1951 version and did not want to taint that in any way . What I love about movies that are pre-special effects is that their strength is in the story . My somewhat inflated vote of 8 rests entirely on the special effects . For acting and story I give a 6\/7 . I liked the micro-plots : for example , the step-mother\/step-son evolution in their relationship . It is also true that we only really find out who we are , what we are made of , when adversity strikes . Will I stand tall or will I cave in ? Will I listen to others or trust in my personal values ? Am I about material things or spiritual things or emotional things ? Who do I turn to in my time of need ? Though John Cleese was only on screen for a few minutes , they were thought provoking few minutes as he and Reeves have a dialoge . The 1951 version of The Day the Earth Stood still rocks but for entertainment value and superb special effects it is worth watching the 2008 version -LRB- oh ! And for all you girls out there , Keanu does n't disappoint -RRB- . " ,8
" Lighten Up People . I did n't see this movie at the theater , largely because of the comments posted on this site . I know - I should n't let other people influence my movie going decisions -LRB- especially people that do n't have Titanic in the top 250 movies list -RRB- , but I am guilty this time . I rented The Day the Earth Stood Still from one of those $ 1 boxes outside McDonald 's so I did n't waste any more money than I had to . I must say I was pleasantly surprised . I have seen the original many times , but really tried to judge this version on its own merits . I found it riveting , found the flow to be steady , and the acting convincing . The special effects were excellent , and I did n't have to struggle to understand the storyline . In short , I truly enjoyed this Sci-Fi flick . I can only guess that the same people that panned this movie also hated the Will Smith remake of Omega Man -LRB- I am legend -RRB- . Do n't listen to them . See it for yourself and judge it based on its own merits . If you are expecting a remake of the original , you WILL be disappointed . Otherwise , enjoy ! " ,8
" Balanced review for all types of movie goers . . First of all I have never seen the original . In fact in my opinion it is probably pretty futile to make comparisons to the original . Without seeing the original I can tell that there are a lot of changes made . I think it would be best to judge this film on it 's own merits as if it was n't a remake . Because let 's face it , how often do remakes really stay true to the original , besides Gus Van Sant 's psycho that if I remember correctly recreated the original shot by shot apart from a few added bits . I would assume that those who have seen the original would not hold this film in high standing and with good reason . It does not reach the heights of the original masterpiece yet claims the same name and story . Like I said I have not seen the original and I was very hesitant about seeing this one given the large amount of negative reviews . I do n't think the film is as bad as many make it out to be , it just suffers from at least one major weakness that I have observed . That is how well the story and characters were fleshed out . I thought the characters personalities fit well enough , and Jaden was not as obnoxious as some claim him to be . I can easily see a young boy in that situation acting just the same way as he did . I found it to be an enjoyable film but it did n't wow me . I think it 's problem is that it did n't have it 's plot and characters fleshed out enough for the serious film goer , and it did n't have enough action -LRB- aka eye candy -RRB- for the action junkie . It fell somewhere in the middle without fully satisfying either extremes of moviegoers . There were many things that I thought were done very well in this film , but overall it did n't have enough to connect with the different types of audiences and as result has become a fairly forgettable film with some very interesting and well done parts that I believe make it worth at least one viewing if you have n't seen it . " ,7
" A less than mediocre remake . I have to start off by stating that many of the characters were so unlikeable . The worst of the bunch was jade Smith . What a little creep , kill him , etc. , that 's all he kept ranting about , kill him , that 's what my dad would do . I personally would have killed him out of the script . The usual unlikeable Earthlings , starting with the shooting of Klatatu , then the whole power we Americans have , we are the most powerful beings in the universe , uhhh , okay sure . I thought Kathy Bates did a standard job as a standard unlikeable political figure . All that being said , I think that once again Hollywood has depended on special affects to wow the viewer and draw our attention away from the lack of acting ability . Somebody lent me this film , I never would have rented it myself , and rightly so . If you are in the mood to rent something and the shelves are bare of other films , pick this one up . " ,4
" Acceptable movie for rental . I was going to give it 7 , but chose to raise this to 8 because this movie delivers a very important message to everyone in the world : that violence only creates more violence and destruction , and love , trust , and peace will always be our best options . Another equally important message being delivered is to take care of our planet and stop killing it . I think the vast majority of the cast did a great job with the acting , and the directing and cinematography were also good or at least acceptable in my personal opinion as a movie watcher . All in all , I would give the movie at least seven stars , and would n't give it higher because there is something wrong with the movie . I ca n't quite put my hand on it , but I think it has to do with missing parts . It 's like something 's missing . Perhaps the boy 's character needed a bit more time at the very beginning , some scenes needed to be justified more properly or convincingly ... something like that . Oh , not a lot of wow factor in the special effects , but the sfx already there was done very nicely . It 's more of a movie that would make you think a bit , than thrill you . I would recommend it for renting . " ,8
" Better than I had heard . Do n't let all of these individuals give this movie a bad rap . Much better than I expected . For once , an alien movie with some real thought . I know it 's a remake of the original but I was just happy to see something that required actual thought . Sorry , but this will not be some huge action flick . -LRB- However , the special effects were great -RRB- It is visually appealing but unless you 've seen the original , it will not be what you expect . Give it a reasonable chance and you will enjoy ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . ... ... ... ... ... . ... ... ... . . ... . ... . ... . ... ... ... ... . ... . ... . . ... ... ... . ... . ... . . ... ... ... ... . ... . ... ... ... ... ... . . ... ... . ... ... ... ... ... . ... ... . ... . . ... ... . . ... These periods are so I do n't have to fill you with needless bs . " ,8
" How can most people not get it ? . Yes , the movie has obvious flaws . The script . The acting . The directing . Overall production values . The only good things about this movie are : 1 . Jennifer Connely . 2 . Keanu Reeves as Klattu . 3 . The timely message . But I would just like to clarify the most common source of gripe in the comments here . The bratty kid . He is supposed to mirror and symbolize the immaturity , unfounded hostility and irrationality of the human race towards more intelligent and more powerful beings -LRB- in the kid 's case , towards Jennifer Conelly is the more intelligent alien -RRB- . Humans are kids compared to Klattu 's race . " ,8
" overall waste of my time . I 'm not going to use a lot of time to comment this movie , since I wasted enough of that watching it . If you read Toby007 comment I totally agree with him on all the points . And let me stress couple of the major points the kid was bloody annoying like mad crazy annoying , and the its probably not this movie 's mistake but the original ones the fact that our emotions and sensibility that changes the aliens mind is completely and utterly ridiculous . On the positive note I must say that Keanu Reeves is the main element together with the robot that keeps this movie above wtf-level . If I would like to see another apocalyptic movie `` The day after tomorrow '' would be clearly better choice . " ,4
" The time my brain stood still ... . ... was five minutes after i saw this movie . Click ... what was that , eh wait a minute : Do they have real actors in Hollywood , i mean those who are master of their business ? If so why ruin a movie why a good potential to be at least an acceptable ` remake ' or new point of view of a classic , by casting the completely wrong actors for every role in this movie . Jennifer Connelly overacting by playing her only stereotype of a delicate intelligent and whiny woman , plagued by the incomprehension of the rest . Jeez , can she play anything else ? Connelly seems so narcissistic and arrogant . The Smith kid Jaden , what a spoiled arrogant pita . Not enough that he lives with the golden spoon in his mouth , no , he is casted for big screen movies because his daddy said : you want to be an actor ? fine ! You can be whatever you want to be . But he probably forgot to tell him , that he has not the talent for everything he wants to be and that what the producers of the movie forget too . Jaden as the gutsy gutsy factor was a total mistake . And Keanu Reeves , he could have played an alien felling uncomfortable in the human body but willing to endure that state of suffering because of fulfilling his mission . BUT , Mr. Reeves , playing an electro-static-toaster is not roughly the same of the job Michael Rennie did 57 years ago . Besides the terrible cast , Scott Derrickson did a decent job to ruin the movie with his ` talent ' and ideas . Nowadays , good quality CGI is not a matter of technical equipment , its a matter of ability . What amateurs designed Gort ? Nanobots looking like blowflies ... etc. . These creatives should have watched the original movie some times more , just to get some inspiration . Do not watch this movie if you liked the original . Do not watch the movie if you want to watch a good movie . " ,1
" watch it to say you have n't . The original ` Day the Earth Stood Still ' was a classic of the sci-fi genre , and accomplished this feat largely by sticking to the elements of science fiction _ writing _ which make such films distinct . This alleged ` remake ' of ` The Day ... ' ignores the elements of suspense , banality , and underlying tensions which made the original both a pleasure to watch and a film which provides a unique social commentary . The rather comical recasting has left the film hokey , empty , flashy -- and nearly unrecognizable . Glitzy MTV montages of electrical communication and flashy effects a la ` The Matrix ' left ` The Day ... ' more as a Matrix cop of and hybrid and nearly unrecognizable as a remake . -LRB- The first 20 minutes which highlight the birth\/escape of Klatuu are added as prequel-like additions to the plot , but were honestly little more than an excuse to make use of special effects and highlight the very stereotypical ` alienness ' of the Other . -RRB- I was anxiously awaiting this release and have now been sorely disappointed -- if you have nothing else to do , watch it to say you have n't .

" t is starting good but it is going on bad . When I found plot of the movie it looked interesting for me . A alien come to the world and said that he came here save the world . Actually he intend `` save the world from people '' anymore and people have make nothing this . t means Jugdement Day . When women help Alien with wrong medicine first disappoint for me . I could n't understand it . t looked very weird to me that scene . Middle of the movie it is said that it have only one way for salvation for that . you can persuade Alien world not will be destroyed . And a mother with child will persuade Alien.in that point my disappointment go to climax and so in the end of the film world is saved like that . bad solution big most problem or judgment day for world . There is a word -LRB- I do n't like that word -RRB- in here like that `` if a women involve a job , that job Will not become good '' . but this word is acceptable for that movie . I mean that watch this movie but . Dont ignore some scenes one thing more , Keanu reeves did n't fit that role . That role must have been ugly person like Beng Kingsley . " ,7
" An entertaining film , worth a look . . I 've finally registered just to comment on the `` user comments '' for this film :-RRB- . Having no intellectual baggage , such as a literary education , lets me `` watch what I likes , when I likes '' and this film was entertaining . There are holes in the physics from the get-go but again this is just a film made for entertaining us for a few hours -LRB- not answer life 's questions -RRB- only and I think it did just that . Keanu was really well suited for this roll as I 've always found him to be inanimate and he did n't disappoint ! The drop-dead-gorgeous Jennifer Connelly -LRB- what a dish she is , sigh , I could watch her all day long :-RRB- -RRB- and the rest of the cast work well together , as a mosaic , across the film but there was nothing fantastic in the acting by anyone -LRB- I 'm sure they all worked extremely hard -RRB- and that was cool because this was an entertaining movie thanks to their work . If you watched the first interpretation of this film -LRB- back when God was making his mind up about what to do next -RRB- and did n't enjoy this new one then I 'm sorry that you carted so much preconceived baggage in with you . The first make of this film was nothing to write home about so do n't hold it up as a comparison because it was full of post-war propaganda . All up better than average but not a top-runger . BTW , sorry I do n't have the skills to word this correctly , that did n't stop me liking the film :-RRB- . " ,7
" Visual f\/x are the only thing worth mentioning in this addled remake of the sci-fi classic .

Visual effects laden remake of the '50s sci-fi classic about a visitor from outer space named Klaatu -LRB- Reeves at his most - yet appropriately here wooden -RRB- whose message of saving Earth is more than meets the eye . Connelly is the scientist attempting to aid the cosmic traveler in his quest but finds herself at odds with the government and military -LRB- natch -RRB- .

" The True Definition of a Science-Fiction . I know many people did n't like this movie , even If I did n't read critics before watching this movie in theaters ! It 's simple , it 's shocking . We , the humans , are stupid enough -LRB- and it 's the case by the way -RRB- , and we will not listen to anybody who comes to our earth , we will probably kill them before they even come . This movie send a great message for our earth ... With all the technology , we are about to make this all happen , the end of our great world . Maybe not now , or in 10 years , but your children will live this . And i 'm not saying , that i 'm better than anyone else , but this is half-fiction , half reality . On the movie , great cast starring Keanu Reeves , Jennifer Connelly and Kathy Bates . The only annoying actor to me was Jaden Smith -LRB- you know , the son of Will -RRB- . He over-acted sometimes , but I give him credit because he 's really young and we 've seen worse ! The subject if you are able to enjoy the show , you will be entertain a lot , and I mean , a lot ! There 's a lot of thing happening in this movie and never gets boring . I can tell everybody that i 'm not disappointed and I hope a lot of people enjoy it too ! Even after 4 weeks in theaters , their was more than half people in the theater for this one ! " ,9
" Why so much negativity ? . I decided to post a comment on this film short after seeing it and having read the comments posted by some other fellow citizens in IMDb.At first i have to say that i have n't seen the 1951 original so i will not compare versions.But unfortunately that 's the hole point because EVERYBODY is comparing it -LRB- inevitably -RRB- with the original.Apart from this i found the movie very entertaining , with all its plot holes , acting from Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly was very good and saved the day and in the end , hey , if you are seeking to find THE MERCHANT OF VENICE in this film , i am sorry to disappoint you.You live in the wrong place at the wrong time.So make your self a favor , do n't compare it with the original , sit back relaxed and enjoy the evening.Thanks a bunch .

" I was in dilemma at first whether to go and see this movie , I 've decided to go anyway and I was right once more to not listen to the critics . . Well , I was in dilemma at first whether to go and see this movie or not since the reviews was n't so good . But I 've decided to go anyway and I was right once more to not listen to the critics . The movie was really good . For all of you , who have many complaints about this movie and for all of you yet to see it , let me clear out some doubts for you . Compare this movie with one from 1951 its nonsense . You can not even call it a remake , because the one in 1951 it 's based on a cold war theory and the new one is dealing with our treatment with mother Earth . Choice of cast is more than good . Keanu is the best choice for the leading role . It 's natural that his face is stoic all the time , because I ca n't imagine that a superior race would give a damn about us regarding how we treat the mother Earth . Also other actors done pretty good job . Maybe some scene could be a little longer with more conversation -LRB- especially one with the professor played by John Cleese -RRB- and a few others , but than a lot of you would probably complain that movie is too long . A lot of the best thing in this movie is in the details that many of the so called critics have overlooked . For instant the scene in the M ' restaurant with the alien who live among us for seventy years , or collecting all the species from earth that needs to be saved -LRB- not us of course -RRB- . The design of GORT the robot was also very good -LRB- ca n't imagine an advanced robot looking like robots made today -RRB- . Somebody mention in one of the critics that not even once a global warming is mentioned . Do not delude ourselves . There are far worse things that we do with Earth that just burning fossil fuels -LRB- pesticides , wiping out the rain forests , nuclear bomb testing and so on and so on -RRB- . Only thing that bothers me is the end of the movie . I thing that just for once the earth should be wiped out of us humans , because we really do n't deserve to survive because of the way how we treat the mother Earth and each other . We are the most destructive race . Regardless of the critics go and see this movie and pay attention to the details . This movie is not just all about special effects , but there is a message inside it that needs our attention . " ,9
" Was Al Gore a co-writer ? . The only good thing about this movie is the promotional department , because they really made it look like a decent movie . WRONG . It was nothing more than the EPA telling us how much damage we were doing to the earth . WE GET IT . do we really need movies about this crap ? After 20 mins I had completely predicted the entire movie with the exception of the bugs -LRB- the only reason it was given 2 stars instead of 1 because that was kind of cool -RRB- . The acting was awful , script even worse . Really puts a damper on the original . The little kid could not have been more annoying . There were nothing but stupid political messages throughout the movie . I really feel bad for those who wasted there money on this piece of trash . " ,2
" Some Nice Moments But Lacking . This remake of the 1951 classic contains some nice elements , adds a poignant emotional element , yet it leaves out a few helpful supportive devices . The rather unique mother-son relationship in this movie is typical , but effective and rarely used . Kathy Bates gets to portray a rather together and the mostly effective political leader in the movie . Missing however are the personal background shots that would have made the movie more tight -LRB- example - the initial confrontation with Keanu Reeves failed to have any reflective shot that motivated the incident that occurred during the scene and there were no background about further military strategies involving the mysterious object that came to earth , they just happened -RRB- . The beginning sequences had a `` Encounter of the Third Kind '' feel which in some ways was both exciting but also irritating , because some of the dialogue did n't seem to ring true . Kyle Chandler 's use in the movie felt miscast . Gort was underused in this version and did n't get quite the key pivotal role that would have made the movie even more on your sit exciting . Keanu Reeves did a competent job and his dialogue was some of the more appealing and captivating . The special effects were both good and sloppy -LRB- for the current movie technology -RRB- . This was a decent , entertaining movie with an emotional bite but failed to equal or exceed the original in scope and intensity . " ,7
" Another side to the remake ? Maybe . When i heard they were remaking The Day The Earth Stood Still I was n't surprised , but i was a little sickened , especially by the casting on Reeves . But lets think about this , the message about the nuclear arms race to the audiences of the 50 's was very relevant to that audience , just as much as global warming is to us . The way the film works was perfect for the fifties audiences , but it uses the same dramatic clich s that all the reviews here are moaning about . Sentimentality being the biggest complaint . In this new movie we ca n't relate to klatu , but why should we ? He is an alien ? I liked that . I liked that he could eat a tuna sandwich while someone has a heart attack . If we are to compare the original and the remake : then in 1951 klatu is there to warn us and ultimately threaten us into growing up and abandoning our nukes . In 2008 he is here to rid the earth of us , and why not ? His argument works for me . OK , like i say , some of the dramatic techniques are clich d , but when you are talking about the better and worse sides of our nature , certainly in terms of our effect on the planet , its going to get a bit sentimental . What other argument do we have ? I think the film works . My one problem may be that what ultimately changes klatu 's mind was n't a good enough reason . Aside from that I thought it was OK and i thought Gort looked wicked . " ,7
" underrated because of false expectations . i really can not understand the people who watches the movies just to tell that they are bad ... the day the earth stood still is a successful movie ... and i think it is more realistic than all the other alien invasion movies . just think of it , we watched movies where the US president saves the world from the aliens or some ordinary guy blows up the alien battle ships ... that 's what you should call bad , this is much better than those movies ... i can understand that most of the people were expecting more action but this time the danger comes in shape of flies that you ca n't even see and you are disappointed because you do n't see the explosions and stuff that you expected to be in the movie ... but there is one thing you should remember , seeing explosions is what you wanted , not what the director or the writer wanted ... so try to watch the film as it is just a film without expectations and you will understand what i am trying to say ... expectations can mislead an objective opinion in most of the cases ... " ,8
" extremely misunderstood . I 'd have given it 7.5 if I could . I had never seen the original , so I decided to watch both back to back . I think I 've realized the chief problem most people have with the new version : it 's not a remake . From the beginning , it 's painfully obvious that the 2008 TDTESS is n't meant to emulate the 1951 original . Instead , it is an embellished translation . In 1951 , the Cold War , atomic warfare , imperialism , and global politics were high on the list of `` problems in this world '' . The entire movie is a transparent commentary on violence , war , and as Klaatu put it , `` stupidity '' . While these general ideas remain constant today , other issues are at hand . Global Warming -LRB- or , translating into less politically charged terms , `` human wastefulness '' -RRB- is beginning to have obvious consequences . To make TDTESSv2 .0 have similar impact to the original , many of the themes must be changed . It makes sense that there would be `` arks '' of sorts , that Klaatu would n't have understood love and humanity -LRB- and thus his exposure to it would change his mind -RRB- , and even that there would have been scouts sent ahead to gather useful information and genetic data . All that said , the execution of this potentially translatable idea was n't perfect . Though some have complained about the McDonald 's scene , I found it brilliant for the most part . Klaatu would have little or no knowledge about what kind of place it was , so it would be equally appropriate to have such a conversation as anywhere else . The switch to English for more ... philosophical points irked me though , it would make more sense for them to switch to their native tongue -LRB- do they have tongues ? -RRB- . GORT 's ... dissolving and subsequent disappearance leave more questions than anything . Also , while the sonic attack he used early on made sense to me , I think that the utter disappearance of weaponry from the original would have been far more affective -LRB- as opposed to basic Hollywood explosions -RRB- . Other bits of discontinuity are mentioned throughout these reviews , so I wo n't need to get too detailed myself . My main complaint is that Klaatu never actually warned any group of people ... how are we supposed to get the message that he was sent to give ? Some execution was handled very well . The plague of old sci-fi is that `` aliens '' tend to look awfully familiar . Most are humanoid , and Klaatu was pretty much human entirely . TDTESSv2 .0 did a very good job eliminating these barriers . The placental mass and subsequent `` birth '' of Klaatu explain both the strange `` salve '' from the original and his resemblance to us . The ship no longer looks like it could ever have come from anything we built , unlike v1 .0 , which looks buildable -LRB- if not functional -RRB- through many means available in the 50 's . The unexplained uniqueness of otherworldly diamonds is completely done away with , as is the suspicious boyfriend . I 'd like to have seen more epiphanies like the one about Abraham Lincoln , but to fit them into the context of the new one may have ruined it . While a horrible remake , the 2008 version of `` The Day The Earth Stood Still '' is a pretty good \* translation \* of the 1951 sci-fi classic . I 'd recommend it to anyone , whether or not they 've seen the original . Actually , I 'd recommend both . " ,7
" A competent visual spectacle . The Day The Earth Stood Still is a movie that has many strong areas . It 's audio-visually compelling with a story-line which gives it important substance and actor performances that do n't require questioning or scrutiny . The film presents an even package which is definitely very impressive at first but evens out towards the ending of the film . Klaatu is undoubtedly the dramatic core of the film , a character with a robotic coldness to his view of the natural order . The film provides a rather good compact dissection into the problems of humanity and though the film may feel slightly preachy in places the message of the film is clear and coherent . I honestly ca n't compare the movie with the original as I 've not seen it but I believe the film has been successful in conveying to film the essential themes of the original . In all general areas of film The Day The Earth Stood Still is competent but it is perhaps not the most original or compelling film of its kind . It 's a competent movie no doubt and worth seeing even if you 're not familiar with the original film . A good film . " ,8
" The day humanity was almost eaten . . Saying that this film should not be judged against the original is just absurd . If you have seen the first film , how could you not compare the two ? This new film does have a lot going for it ; its updated environmental message , great special effects , good acting , and the military technology is very state-of-the art . It even starts out to be a great science fiction movie ; the beginning is both exciting and suspenseful . However , once Klaatu escapes , the excitement starts to fade and is never really re-captured throughout the rest of the film . Here is where a comparison between the two films becomes relevant . In the original , Klaatu is anonymous , he takes a room at a boarding house and while trying to meet a representation of the world scientists , he starts a process of observation and familiarization with the human race . It is through these experiences that he concludes we should be given another chance . In the new version it is not very clear what is really going on . It might be bad direction or it could be poor editing , but we are given a bunch of seemingly unrelated events before an abrupt ending . In the first film , Klaatu makes the earth stand still to prove his omnipotent abilities without aggression . In the new film there is no reason . " ,7
" Klaatu barada nikto . Every so often one feels like an alien . Why is everybody else so wrong all the time ? Why do people -- humans , that is -- insist in driving like total morons ? Why do I know what the world 's leaders should be doing , but they do n't ? It makes one feel so hopeless . Then one hears a snatch of Bach . It 's transcendently beautiful . One realizes Bach too , technically anyway , was a human . And so the race must be saved . We ca n't throw out the Bach with the bath , can we ? That 's what this movie 's about , more or less . It 's based on the 1951 Robert Wise sci-fi classic . In the original , followed here in many outward respects , a superior being who 's assumed human form came to earth with a giant robot called Gort . They represented an intergalactic organization of peaceable cultures who wanted to save us from nuclear destruction . Nowadays the planet is more infested with nuclear bombs and bomb-makers than ever , but fashions in paranoia having changed , in 2008 the alien arrives with an Inconvenient Truth . Our habits are destroying the earth , and since only a few planets can sustain life , this matters . We do n't turn out to be too amenable to discussion , or even friendly , toward this visitor . It might have helped if he 'd said he was coming . Everybody thought his space ship was a meteor that was going to destroy Manhattan . Anyway , almost the minute he walks out the door into Central Park he 's met with a barrage of heavy weaponry and sustains a serious bullet wound . It just gets worse from there , and the more he sees of us , the more he 's convinced that we 're just a heedless , headstrong species . To save the planet he therefore decides we , and all our stuff , have simply got to go . Precisely because Fifties sci-fi was crude technically , it worked better as fable . As the effects have grown , they 've taken up the space for ideas and the time for people to talk . This new ` Day ' has n't changed the traditional sci-fi trappings : hysterical mobs ; clumps of concerned citizens , experts , and leaders . Weaponry ; men in uniform , commanders barking useless orders ; shimmering spaceships ; stalking monsters . Screens flashing technical information . A blackboard covered with mysterious equations only the smartest guys understand . This time invading critters have been added ; and CGI , if not of the finest quality . All of which may delight an eight-year-old boy , but does n't add up to much because this is n't a very good movie . It 's not a terrible one either , and it does give one that am-I-an-alien ? feeling . But it is probably less thought-provoking than the original , partly because of the emphasis on the effects , and partly because the writing and direction are not top-drawer . The President has fled to an undisclosed location , like Dick Cheney , and the main authority figure is , presciently for our time , a female Secretary of Defense -- Kathy Bates , in a lame , back-and-forth role . There 's a smart , plucky woman astrobiologist , and Jennifer Connelly is good at that . There 's a cute , uncooperative kid , her foster son , and Jaden Smith -LRB- son of Will -RRB- is good at that . And Keanu Reeves , as Klaatu , makes a super alien . But his dialogue is limp and preachy and after a while it goes stale . He never gets to deliver the most famous robot-language line in the literature , `` Klaatu barada nikto , '' which was a `` safe-word '' phrase designed to be used in an emergency , if necessary , to save Klaatu and stop Gort from destroying the earth . Neither does the `` earth stand still '' to demonstrate Klaatu 's power to earthlings and convince them they must change , as in the original movie . On the run with Helen -LRB- Connolly -RRB- and Jacob -LRB- Smith -RRB- after being confined and interrogated , Klaatu meets a Chinese alien in a Macdonald 's who 's lived on earth seventy years and has come to like humans . -LRB- Doubtless he 's been here too long and should have been reassigned . -RRB- Klaatu also encounters a a Nobel scientist -LRB- John Cleese -RRB- , with the blackboard full of equations and a nice rug . This is where Klaatu hears the snatch of Bach and realizes humans can make beautiful things . The best thing about aliens is that they have a human side . Klaatu is nice enough to reconsider wiping out the human species , even after he 's unleashed a plague upon us . Can he even stop it ? The ending is muffled and anticlimactic . Kids , or the kid in you , will like the CGI swarms of viruses that invade everything and fly around in the form of metallic locusts . They gobble a freeway sign in nanoseconds and a whole giant truck speeding down the highway in not much longer . But in doing this , they also gobble up time the movie might have had to mean something more . And due to the writing , Keanu\/Klaatu , though in his conception and how he 's introduced he 's more convincingly alien than Robert Wise 's , comes to seem a Johnny One Note , which nothing to offer us but his pathetic lack of affect and his tiny , half-convincing movement toward pity . One remembers , and misses , the delight of Jeff Bridges ' alien in John Carpenter 's ` Starman ' , a film full of inventive writing such as this lacks . " ,7
" Is it better than the ORIGINAL ??? . Do n't worry , I wo n't provide an extensive outlook of this movie , just the meat and potatoes of my opinion of the movie . Overall , I enjoyed the upgraded differences in the movies , it made the movie much more believable . Unfortunately the movie came up short and left the audience in speculation as compared to the first movie due to the ending . All this movie required was the ULTIMATUM speech , LIKE IN THE 1ST MOVIE , broadcasted throughout the world via the tremendous power\/technology obviously possessed by the alien race in order to make this a blockbuster . Oh well , so much for the epilogue . Change is good , but to take a classic and changes without a great ending is just ... ... BAD " ,7
" Klaatu Reeves , anyone ? . The main selling point of Scott Derrickson 's decision to remake Robert Wise 's The Day the Earth Stood Still -LRB- a sci-fi masterwork -RRB- is that a lot of people have heard about it , but very few have actually seen it . Even the film 's most famous line , `` Klaatu barada nikto '' -LRB- which is spoken in the remake as well -RRB- , is more known to genre fans thanks to Sam Raimi 's brilliant comic interpretation in Army of Darkness -LRB- a movie Derrickson has said to be a big fan of , by the way -RRB- . The new version does n't live up to the original , but it does have enough substance to qualify as a popcorn movie of the smarter kind . These being our post-9 \/ 11 times , major changes are required : instead of Washington , it is Manhattan that Klaatu 's spaceship lands in ; the robot Gort is a heck of a lot bigger ; and the alien visitor itself is actually , well , alien . It is n't until the creature is hospitalized with a gunshot wound -LRB- you know , the US military : shoot first , ask questions later -RRB- that the gray skin falls off and a human shape -LRB- well , Keanu Reeves -RRB- is revealed . This shape has something to say . As usual , the Secretary of Defense -LRB- Kathy Bates -RRB- , standing in for the President , does n't care about listening , and those who do -LRB- a group of scientists , played by Jennifer Connelly and Mad Men 's Jon Hamm among others -RRB- might not have enough influence to stop Klaatu 's Earth-saving `` process '' . After all , he does n't have that high an opinion of the human race : `` If you die , the Earth survives '' . Coming after Emmerich 's The Day after Tomorrow , Spielberg 's War of the Worlds and Shyamalan 's more understated The Happening , Derrickson 's picture is another bleak portrait of our society , which finds itself , to quote the characters , on the brink of a precipice . Whereas the '51 version was a warning against a potential nuclear war , the update is more concerned with the environment , although , and that 's one of the movie 's weaknesses , it does n't go very far in pinpointing its message . Subtlety is n't generally a defect , but too much of it can be . In terms of narrative , one might also wonder why writer David Scarpa put in a clich d mother\/son story-arc which slows down the movie considerably -LRB- besides , Jaden Smith is quite annoying in the entire first half of the feature -RRB- . As for the other aspect that could have been problematic , namely explicit references to Wise 's movie , it 's actually a strength , as Derrickson make sure that classic scenes -LRB- the blackout , for example -RRB- get the 21st century treatment they deserve . The new Gort , in particular , is worth the price of the ticket alone , making Transformers look like an Ed Wood movie . Only the classic meeting with Professor Barnhardt fails to deliver , and that 's because John Cleese is the weakest link in an otherwise fine cast -LRB- even Prison Break 's Robert Knepper manages to transcend stereotype -RRB- . The biggest question , of course , is whether Reeves can pull it off . The answer , which was already present in the trailer , is a confident `` Hell , yes ! '' : he 's no Michael Rennie , that 's for sure , but his trademark lack of emotion , which came close to ruining Dracula and Dangerous Liaisons , makes him the perfect choice for the role of an alien . In fact , it 's not hard to believe that the producers never thought of anyone else when the project started taking shape . Bottom line : 1951 - an essential genre picture , with a great script , lots of suspense and a chilling central performance ; 2008 - an enjoyable revisit , with great visual effects , a relevant but underdeveloped message , and a scarily effective Keanu Reeves .

" Interesting Movie ... . This movie is definitely not of the movies that grabs your attention when your walking inside the theater , but i would suggest people that when they come to watch this movie they should have no wild guesses about this movie , is it gon na be a kick-ass kinda movie with Fifi actions etc. . I would rather have nothing going back in my mind when am on my way to the theater . This movie is really a touching message to man kind . After you watch this movie and if by any chance you get to read this comment i want to ask you what if this really happens ? And truly it would be the end of the world cause we did n't treated right . . to put it short a tragic reaction for a long mistreated action.Think about it . " ,8
" Not terrible , but also not more than the sum of its parts . It seems that over the years , Keanu Reeves has developed quite a taste for big-budget SF movies with a generally positive message about humanity - and , just like his colleague Will Smith , with a more than healthy success at the box office . This time , The Excellent Dude is going for a remake of a classic SF movie from 1951 , which again is based on a 1940 story -LRB- `` Farewell to the Master '' - worth reading and available online -RRB- . On board are John Cleese , Jennifer Connelly and more Special FX specialists than you can shake a mouse at . Unfortunately , in this case , the whole is not greater than its parts . Actually , the one aspect of the movie that still seems as plausible as in the 1951 version is the degree of fear and aggression that meets the Alien visitor - including , but not limited to a US Secretary of Defense that denies him to see the United Nations ; a less-than-subtle hint at the current state of world politics . There is some promise in the second act , when various parties try to get access to Klatu , but beyond a certain point , the plot and the emotional\/dramatic turning points are predictable . The same story could have been told very effectively in a 30 minute Outer Limits episode - but then , a lot of people would have earned less money . Speaking of money : the concept of how \* different \* Alien technology could be and the special effects derived from it have potential , but it is never fully realized . I.e. , the spheres are often shown without any visual context allowing us to estimate their size . The same goes for the robot . On the other hand , it 's not this movie 's fault that we have been spoon-fed breathtaking CGI for a decade and now simply sit here with synapses that ca n't take much more . I also believe that there probably was a bet if someone could play the main character of a big budget movie with fewer facial expressions than Arnold Schwarzenegger in the original `` Terminator '' . If so , Keanu Reeves has clearly won . And while I 'd like to believe that this is simply a terrible weight this particular role put on him , I 'll go with the `` Matrix 4ever '' theory of a guy who has finally found the facial expression that will earn him the most money . Now I am slightly surprised seeing my hands write what most come across as a very cynical look at what is basically a big-budget show with a message of hope . Why ? I went into this movie expecting a decent mainstream SF movie , but the fact that I am rather disappointed now may be due to the fact that it tried to be more - just \* very \* half-heartedly . And although I agree with the movie 's core message about the harm we are doing to the planet we live on , led by greed , fear and stupidity , it did n't touch me emotionally . It was like two puppets on sticks -LRB- the other one being a seemingly bored Jennifer Connelly -RRB- reciting Romeo and Juliet . It 's not impossible to make such a thing fly - it just takes more talent than we saw here . For now , I believe John Carpenter 's `` Starman '' still is the most touching , wonderful movie about human life as seen from a higher perspective . Rent it when you have the time . The effects are what you can expect from a 1984 , medium-budget John Carpenter production . But is has heart and soul , great dialog and , last but not least - The Really Excellent Dude in one of his most-overlooked roles . " ,3
" Could there be any more of an agenda ? . Presented today , I have the underlying agenda for every Hollywood movie for the next tens years . Put simply , if the movie does n't touch on the environment or ` going green ' , it simply wo n't make the cut ... Ever wonder how the Xenomorphs from Alien\/Aliens came about ? They were once peaceful unicorns that lived on a lush and beautiful planet . But due to the evil Earth 's noxious atmosphere -LRB- of course , the fault of the people living on it -RRB- , having made its way 200 light years to the peaceful unicorn 's home planet , over a millennia the unicorns eventually mutated into the acid-for-blood beasties we all know and love . Acid rain ? Acid-for-blood ? Starting to see where this is going ? And that 's what we have in The Day The Earth Stood Still . More of the same green agenda that permeates every second of our lives . " ,3
" An unexpected gem . I had decided not to bother with this movie after reading the reviews here . Then circumstances left me with this or a couple of hours of crosswords . The plot varied only little from the original . Back then , the message was ` do what you like here but expand your warlike ways into space and it 's goodbye ' . Now the message is `` you 've screwed the planet , there are n't many livable one 's around , so you 've got ta go '' . The point was n't belabored , it was simply stated . Klaatu accepted the verdict of a predecessor that we were incapable of change . This was confirmed by his own brief experience here and so he triggered our doomsday . Then he saw another side to us and made his own decision to halt the already underway destruction . The plot , outwardly simple and seemingly in danger of being a ` greenie ' message , did not descend to preaching . It was well paced , well acted and with good special effects without depending on special effects . I would have liked more of John Cleese however . " ,9
" Good movie . Solid story and a great looking Gort ! . Normally remakes make me barf . I literally feel ill . But sometimes some remakes are OK . Like the Thing or Scarface . The movie has to be old enough that a new take on it is worth trying . I feel that in this case , a remake would be OK . Let me make myself clear the original Day is better than this movie . It is better written and executed . But I must also say that I really enjoyed this movie . The point of Klaatu coming was changed a bit , from a message to a mission , but I feel that there was enough here to justify the remake . People are hating this movie for a few reasons , one of which being the question : why would an alien care if we destroy ourselves and this planet . Well they answer this , Klaatu says that there are very few worlds that can sustain intelligent and complex life , and we should not destroy the one we have . Other say this is an environmental message we it is and it is n't . We can destroy the earth in several ways , not just pollution . So this is not a green peace movie . And yes , I know the movie has product placement etc. . But I mean what movie does n't . They had to pay for GORT some way , and oh man , they got their money 's worth . This new Gort is one of the best robots I have seen in any film ! I loved him . I wish there was more of him , but then again , I thought they would only show 1 second , so I 'm glad I was wrong . I do wish it was Gort doing more of the destruction than Mistified-Gort but what can you do . The message in the movie was n't clear to audience or the people of earth , but I think the message was that we will change , but only when we are pushed to the extreme . We have to be on the brink , in order to really change who we are . And that was verbalized in the film , so there 's your message . Klaatu will come back to finish the job if we do n't . I feel that this movie deserves at least one view if not a few views . The old film did a great job of hammering in the message it wanted to state this one is a bit more subtle . You have pay attention and take from it what you will . Some are comparing to the original , which is always the case with a remake , but I think this film can stand on it 's own as a good sci-fi picture , without being bashed on by people who do n't take the time to think after a movie and just say `` it sucks '' .

" !! A great movie !! ... 90 % of these comments are useless . After seeing The original movie i thought i would check out the new one because i found the message of the movie fascinating . So i checked on IMDb first to see the ratings and comments and after reading the comments i was doubtful of the movie but decided to go anyway and ... THIS MOVIE IS GREAT . Now , i usually do n't like Hollywood films with there shitty dramatic every thing ends well formula but this one was good . I think most of the people did n't get it , this movie shows and mocks the stupidity of the government and how it would probably react with there guns , tanks and missiles witch of course had no affect and we the humans think that we are all mighty and every one is scared of us and the movie shows it . Kathy Bates as Regina Jackson did an amazing job at pissing me off as the stupid idiot of America that in the end discovers the stupidity of her and whom she was representing -LRB- The president of USA -RRB- . Effects we 're awesome , Keanu was made for the role of Klaatu , Gort was epic and transformed into these little bugs or flies that eat every thing man has made . Much better then if Gort in his original form would have destroyed the earth . and what i also liked was the way `` they '' -LRB- ailiens -RRB- collected most of earths creatures like Noah 's ark -LRB- the story -RRB- . The script got a little messy in the end with a little Hollywood drama but nothing that got out of hand -LRB- unlike the ending of war of the worlds -RRB- . I also liked that the director kept some of the features from the original . However what i disliked the most was that damn Will smith kid -LRB- Jaden smith -RRB- damn he was annoying , not as an actor but the character of Jacob Benson . In the end 8\/10 go see it in the theater . worth it ! " ,8
" An enjoyable movie . This film is getting a lot of negative reviews , but I found it to be quite enjoyable , and better than the original -LRB- usually that does n't happen -- consider ` Planet of the Apes ' or ` War of the Worlds ' where the original was vastly superior -RRB- . I rented the original the night before watching this one to directly compare them . Many people have nostalgic memories of the 1951 version , but even taking into account that it was LOW BUDGET -LRB- could n't they have hired a few more than 2 extras to guard the saucer !!? -RRB- it was slow paced and had a lot of silly plot elements . In the 2008 movie , many elements of the original are present , which is charming , but things are presented in a more sophisticated manner . Yes , there are still some silly elements . John Cleese was very enjoyable , and Keanu Reeves gives a good performance as always . I will enjoy seeing this again in 5 or 10 years . " ,7
" Questions for The Day the Earth Stood Still remake . To the director Scott Derrickson : When you were on set watching these performances did someone have a gun at your head when you said `` cut , print '' , or did you actually think these actors were giving you good performances ? To the screenwriter David Scarpa : Did you re-read your first draft , sober ? When you were done did you send the studio the wrong copy ? Or did it all make sense to you at the time , sober ? To the male lead Keanu Reeves : Did the director tell you your character is basically the Matrix dude but in a Brooks Brother suit so just play it like that ? To the kid star Jaden Smith : Did anybody ever tell you that being the son of a great actor does n't mean you do n't have to actually act yourself ? To the female lead Jennifer Connelly : You give the only decent performance in this film but did you ever ask the director how come some of the scenes made no sense at all ? Have you figured out yet how to get this blemish off your film resume ? To everyone involved with the making of this film : When you saw it complete for the first time did you squirm in your seat and boo and hiss like everyone in the audience where I watched it ? To anyone considering spending $ 10 watching this movie : I wish there was a way to get a refund from the producers of this dog . But maybe I 'm wrong .

" holy sweet mother of god . went to this movie yesterday with some friends . totally unprepared and so without any prejudice at all , completely open mindend . the only thing I know was keanu reaves stars and it 's a remake of an sf-movie of the 50 's i 've never saw . the movie amused me the first 20-30 m but to moment u think the story will go in overdrive now -LRB- when keanu 's character escapes -RRB- the movie goes horribly wrong.first things just started to go wrong , ... from wrong it went to bad , from there it became worse to end eventually in absolute horrid agony . i left the theater with an uncomfortable feeling like u was abused from behind . do n't go see this movie unless you like completely predictable stories . a movie with a story you just do n't care about or a movie who give you major hints about the -LRB- extremely -RRB- bad plot more than a hour the story ends " ,1
" Movie is entertaining . My wife and I were really looking forward to seeing a good Sci Fi movie but then Mr. Moviefone of channel 7 -LRB- ABC -RRB- said that it is `` one of the worst movies of the year '' , so I was unhappy . In spite of Mr. Moviefone 's review , we decided anyway to go , but to see it at a matin e -LRB- if it 's so bad , then at least spend less $ on it -RRB- . Well , with my lowered expectations , I was very pleasantly surprised . It is a well done remake of the original classic -LRB- with a few plot differences , and also brought up to date -RRB- . At the end of the movie I thought that only about an hour had gone by , but the movie is actually around 1hr 45 min . so that meant it did n't drag . It has the same level of quality and entertainment as `` The Day After Tomorrow '' -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and `` Independence Day '' -LRB- 1996 -RRB- . I do n't know why so many are ragging on this movie . Maybe they had very high expectations and so were disappointed it is n't a 10 . But is it well shot , good effects , OK acting , good setting of mood , and is entertaining and well paced , so I think Mr. Moviefone is being super-harsh . " ,8
" Re-imagining Of Original With A New Message . What is wrong with critics lately ??? It seems like they collectively decide which films they will like and which they will hate before they even come out . The major point here is that I did not think it was as bad as people said it was . I have to admit that I had mixed feelings about this movie initially . I kind of wanted to see it but I generally do not like remakes . There have been way too many of them recently . But I went to see it anyway and I 'm glad I did . Here 's why : 1 -RRB- It is not really a remake . It is more like a re-imagining . They kept the same characters and same basic story about Klaatu coming to Earth , but the message is much different than the message from the original . It is a new , powerful message that I think everyone should hear and that relates very well to present day circumstances . 2 -RRB- As another reviewer said , it is one of those movies that makes you think , even though it 's not particularly uplifting . It forces you to evaluate the future of the human race and our responsibility as a species on this planet . It is a bit heavy and ponderous at times , but not so much so as to make it a horrible movie . I think this may be the reason that many people , including some critics , did n't like it . They do n't like being `` preached to '' by `` liberal tree-huggers . '' They do n't like being evaluated and judged . 3 -RRB- The special effects are breathtaking and I wish I could have seen it in I-MAX . Oh and GORT is extremely creepy . They did a great job with him -LRB- even though he 's like 5,000 times bigger than the original GORT -RRB- . There were a few things I did n't particularly like and some things that could have been done better , such as the ending and a few of the shots\/scenes . The acting was n't horrible but it could have been better in a few spots as well . Keanu did a relatively good job portraying Klaatu but at the same time there was something missing from his performance . Overall , it is not a bad movie . It has its flaws and is not a Michael Bay action extravaganza , but it is NOT boring or awful . It has a powerful message that some people may not like , a beautiful , almost enchanting story , amazing special effects and it is definitely worth seeing in theaters in my opinion , especially if you can see it in I-MAX . Great re-imagining and perfect for the current environmental situation . DO NOT BELIEVE THE CRITICS !!!! 7.5 \/ 10 " ,8
" Disappointed . I was truly disappointed with this re-make . I left the theater wondering what happened to Gort ? There should have been more of Gort . -LRB- Loch Martin would be shocked -RRB- Why were Patricia Neal Billy Gray not given a guest appearance ? They are still alive . My thoughts are that they saw the script and declined . -LRB- I would have too -RRB- The original 1951 classic is just that , a fantastic movie . Michael Rennie would be disappointed also . The ending left me stumped . The writers failed in a very large way . I will never ever add this re-make to my DVD collection . They did a horrible job . This is why I hate when the re-make classics !!!!! " ,2
" Nice and safe . . OK kids , this is what this movie should be but the studios writers and filmmakers are cowards . So instead of war they went for a nice safe `` saving the environment '' . -LRB- Not a spoiler , mentioned about in the trailers -RRB- It 's pretty and safe . Klaatu 's Final Speech http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WyHNgbrsoTo Keep making remakes Hollywood , it inspires me and my friends to go get the originals and you miss out on the $ $ , $ $ $ , $ $ $ . $ $ We am not against remakes and we know there is no way you will want to take risks when it 's about making money not telling stories . It 's partly our fault , we get the media we earned . -LRB- Sorry , Not trying to rant , just trying to fill 10 lines of txt . -RRB- But in all seriousness , save your cash opening weekend , invite some friends over and watch the 1951 movie before you decide to see this one .

" Some people just love to complain . First off , i have seen both movies . Unlike some wan na be yuppie i do n't like what i think it is cool to like . This is a good film with some suspense and action . Keanu was natural in the part and i think he did it well . People say Arnie cant act , yet Tom Cruise or George Clooney would have made a poor Conan . I have seen many complaints on this site with reference to the original . Come on people this is the oldest story in the world , retold in a different format time after time . For what it is , i thoroughly enjoyed it and the time viewing flew by . A good indication of a good film is if time flies and at the end you are left feeling enlightened and uncheated . On both accounts i was surprisingly pleased . No this will not win any Oscars , it will not smash box office records . It was and will remain a very enjoyable film and worth a trip to the theater on a cold and dark winters night . As far as i am concerned this is the best Sci Fi film this year . Do n't be swayed by the majority of original fans that seem to be hell bent trying to pan this to death give it a go , i am sure you will be pleasantly surprised " ,9
" A surefire Oscar Winner . Yes ! At last , good old Keanu 's going to get an Oscar for Best Actor . Expressionless face , wooden movements , spacey stare ... that 's exactly how an omnipotent alien who 's been fit into a new body would act , no ? And we all know that 's where Keanu 's a real specialist . I went into the cinema without much expectations . The first 10 minutes were glorious and I started to build up some level of anticipation . But that all came crashing down the moment Gort came out of the spaceship . This movie is just bad , bad , bad . Bad acting -LRB- even Jennifer Connelly was bad , and Kathy Bates was such a disappointment -RRB- , bad writing -LRB- big gaps , inconsistencies , completely predictable for every minute , ZZZzzz -RRB- , bad directing . What a let-down . I 've not seen the original , nor heard about it until now ... But from what I read , I figure everyone should just save their money to rent the original instead . " ,3
" There 's More To It Than Meets The Eye ... . I 've JUST seen this film - I think that with audiences and critics alike , it will not accomplish much . However , since the original : ideologies , meanings and the interpretation of life as we know it have dramatically changed ; and the remake shows this to us . The biggest and most vital change to the narrative is that -LRB- due to the constant mediated stories regarding pollution and human made global warming -RRB- now the EARTH is what needs saving from the HUMANS and this is what is key to the movie . It 's showing to us -LRB- through stunning CGI 's , visual effects and admittedly slightly corny acting -RRB- that we are destroying the planet and that something dramatic DOES need to happen for us to do anything about it . Many of you will no doubt feel maybe patronised and\/or frustrated by the idea that the director has sort of thrown his environmental beliefs and concerns down our throats -LRB- similarly to Shyamalan 's `` The Happening '' - which certainly was dreadful -RRB- . But I think you have to really think about what the film is TRYING to achieve - and thats to give us a sense of realisation about ourselves and the actions we take -LRB- environmentally in this case -RRB- . Due to it 's inventiveness and subtlety in the point its making , I think its fair to give it a 7 . Plus , all this aside , the action was awesome , as was the tension ! A good effort at trying to mold a cult classic . " ,7
" If it ai n't broke ... . Following last year 's `` I am Legend '' from Warner Bros. , directed by Frank Lawrence and starring Will Smith , is 20th Century Fox 's `` The Day the Earth Stood Still , '' a cautionary tale directed by Scott Derrickson -LRB- `` The Exorcism of Emily Rose '' -RRB- and starring a sleepwalking Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly . And so it goes . Another year , another remake of a film tackling an apocalyptic theme that deals with the extinction of the human race . And New York City is once again at the forefront of the events . Adapting the 1951 sci-fi classic to fit contemporary issues , David Scarpa 's reworking of Edmund H. North 's 1951 screenplay substitutes the issue of global warming in place of themes of Cold War . Klaatu -LRB- Reeves -RRB- , a representative of a highly intelligent extra-terrestrial civilization , comes to Earth to save it from the human race who have been gradually destroying the planet . Initially , he attempts for a dialog with the Earth 's leaders , but when his requests are not granted , he decides that the only way to save the planet is to annihilate humankind . It 's up to astrobiologist Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- and her stepson Jacob -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- to convince Klaatu that it 's not too late for humans to change and save the world . The film initially holds promise with a sense of tension and urgency that feels about to unspool anytime . Sadly that moment never comes as the whole proceedings play out . Despite a serviceable CGI , there 's neither a memorable performance from Reeves nor Connelly , and the experience feels more like a long delayed sequel of `` Independence Day , '' only blander . As the film clocks in more running time , the less sense of urgency it delivers , capping it with a denouement that 's so emotional , aliens finally believe humans can undo the damage and indeed save earth . If only they can also undo the disservice this film does to the classic ... " ,4
" The Day I Barfed After Watching A Movie . I do n't have much to add to the list of reviews already completed . I just wanted to voice my disgust over what Hollywood has done to the sci-fi genre . WHY do they have to dumb down movies to the lowest common denominator ? Are 5th graders the target audience ? Why ca n't somebody make a decent sci-fi movie for reasonably intelligent adults ? This movie disappoints in so many ways : 1 -RRB- We do n't get an alien spaceship just a totally awe-lacking sphere of spinning lights . 2 -RRB- Instead of a charismatic alien like Michael Rennie , we get a robotic Keanu Reeves . 3 -RRB- CGI is used to create a cartoonish robot Gort , instead of believable special effects . 4 -RRB- Ridiculous ideas such as Secretary of State Kathy Bates calling the shots instead of the President 5 -RRB- The aliens are capable of interstellar travel but their representative arrives flopping around like a fish out of water in a placenta spacesuit . 6 -RRB- An annoying little kid that would increase my desire to destroy the planet . I also laughed at the part where there is a plane full of GIs - Jennifer Connely , one of the hottest women on Earth , walks onboard and the GIs keep staring across the aisle at each other . HAHAHAHAHA ! Finally , if an interstellar alien decided to remove humans from the planet , why would they send a representative ? Just send the idiotic little metal bugs . They spend so much money but churn out crap like Independence Day and TDTESS . Please make some a good scifi movie for grownups before I die , Hollywood morons . I have nothing against remakes but abhor mindless tripe like TDTESS 2008 . " ,3
" An unoriginal , uninteresting film that will be quickly forgotten . Alrighty then , The Day The Earth Stood Still remake , 2008 . Well , I actually saw this one before the original , and thought it was okay . Then I watched the original and realized what a bad film the remake was . It seems nowadays , that nobody can come up with any fresh ideas , and we are instead being swarmed by remakes . Bad ones at that . This one is a brilliant example of such cr \* ppy movies that do n't resemble the quality of the original at all . All movies now contain whiny , annoying , hateful brats , and this is no exception . Jaden Smith 's annoying as hell performance only adds to the sheer awfulness of this movie . Jenifer Connely puts on a performance that 's just , okay , and Keanu Reeves , well , he 's well cast . Script , okay , acting , okay , special effects , well , the Special Effects are fantastic as in most movies now , but they alone can not save this movie from its okayness . IT 'S JUST SO OKAY . That in turn made me board , and thus , wallah , it 's a bad movie that 's ... Okay . " ,3
" Vile , Insipid , Boring - A Travesty . The worst thing about this remake is that they hung the name of \* the \* classic 50 's sci-fi film on it . The new Day has virtually nothing in common with the original save for a few character names and the general notion of an alien coming to Earth to make us do something we were unwilling to do ourselves . The film is so low key , it is hard to believe it was even written . Everyone sleepwalks through their parts , perhaps taking a cue from Reeves , who generates about as much excitement in this film as does the ingredient list on a box of Cream of Wheat . Virtually \* nothing \* happens in this movie . There is no sense of tension , no dramatic unfolding of plot . You could n't possibly care less about any of the sketchily drawn characters - it is perhaps revealing that Gort , the now giant robot weapon system , has more personality than all the other characters in the film rolled together ... and he does n't speak . Even the numerous helicopters in the movie are CGI , and they \* still \* have more personality than Reeves . This remake is a classic example of Hollywood , bereft of ideas , trying to profit on name recognition and fond memories . Even the you 're ruining the planet and killing yourselves theme of the film is less threatening than a warm , purring kitten . I ca n't even work up the energy to be offended at how this bland , vapid remake lifted superficial details from the original , because it is so utterly unlike the earlier , vastly , vastly , VASTLY better original . I paid one dollar to rent this film from a Redbox . I feel like I was robbed . Truly one of the worst films ever made . " ,2
" Absolutely Dreadful ! . I 'm surprised that this movie got as many decent ratings as it has thus far . The story of this movie is simple . Humans are poisoning and killing the planet . Aliens are here to save mother earth from the stupid , evil humans . The premise is just absurd now as so many movies have taken up aliens and the environment . Putting the two together is just laughable . Keanu Reeves outdoes himself -LRB- in a bad way -RRB- on this one with his embarrassing performance . Remaking this movie was such a mistake with this cast . The performances were indicative of what it really was ... another big paycheck for a zombie-like meandering on a Hollywood set . " ,1
" The real message ? . This movie turned out to be a disappointment . The special effects were great but about half way through the movie came with a message that basically said that humans were killing the planet . Total B.S. Maybe they should have had Al Gore play Klaatu instead Keanu Reeves . I kept expecting him to jump out at any time and start spewing global warming propaganda . In the 1970 's the hot topic was global cooling and scientists said we would be half gone by now . People started hoarding food and water in those days because of that . I know that for a fact . My parents did that . Well guess what , we 're still here and bigger than ever . Now it seems Hollywood has become part of the propaganda machine . There wo n't be no end to this until the government controls our lives completely . That 's what it 's really about . I give this movie a 2 for the special effects , otherwise it would have been a 1 . " ,2
" one of the worst remakes made . just horrible . who did the rewrite on this pile ? thank god for P2P because I would n't pay 50 cents for even renting this thing . so many lost opportunities . 1 -RRB- jada . why was his character such a whinny little kid . maybe that 's all he 's capable of . does 20th century owe will smith some money ? why is his kid even in this film ? why do we see Connely 's character as this brilliant professor only to see her later brow beaten by this little brat ? oops ... 2 -RRB- why did we have to once again take the ignorant defensive `` we do n't know so let 's blow it up '' stance . been there done that . OK its a remake but this view just does n't swing anymore . it was acceptable in the 50 's and for Rambo fans but not now . not after the things Bush has put us through . the political stance this film makes is just embarrassing . if you do n't understand it kill it . 3 -RRB- just the overall boring dialog . well until the Coen 's want to make a sci-fi i guess we 're stuck with this kind of film . i hope they went well over budget so they cant afford to make this kind of garbage again . they really dropped the ball on this " ,1
" The 1951 version is far better . I saw the 1951 version when I was 6 and was totally overwhelmed with THE STORY . I wasted $ 10 seeing the current rebake which was terrible . This is an excellent example of visual effects ruling production rather than a well written story , and wasting actors talents . The movie stumbles around without a well define objective , and looks like it writers lived on different planets . The movie does n't flow smoothly and leaves the audience to imagine what happened . If E.T. saw this movie before coming to earth , he would have aborted the mission . I left the theater totally UNDERWHELMED , and was would have request a refund if the holiday lines were n't so long . SAVE YOU 'RE $ $ $ AND IF YOU MUST RENT IT ! " ,2
" Horrible . I am a fan of the 1951 Day The Earth Stood Still . When I saw this movie I was all but satisfied . This movie , having some of the best special effects I 've seen on the big screen , truly had some potential to be great . Gort was phenomenal and breathtaking , I wish I could say that for the rest of the film . Another good thing of the movie was Jennifer Connelly 's wonderful acting ability , her being one of the few good actors in the film . The reason why this film was so horrible was that with all of its astounding special effects , and some good direction , It lacked all the compassion and the message of peace that made the original so special . Hopefully , this heartless remake will be forgotten . Now , the idea to make a remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still is a good one . I certainly think that Hollywood needs a movie as touching as the classic original . It 's to bad it could n't happen today . This movie is shown so very excitingly but its problem is , there is no heart to the movie , and its only point is to try to wow you by some extreme , loud , and tiresome special effects . " ,1
" An amazing remake of a great classic ! . This movie was good for a number of reasons , my top one was that Keanu Reeves was in it my other was that it was Sci-Fi , I love Sci-Fi . This movie had a certain appeal to it it was very dark and intense , it was smart and intimidating.It was all around a great film . This remake of the 1951 Sci-Fi political inept classic is nothing short of brilliant . It brings so much more to the table than the original and it does great with all the new technology and upgrades in the story and plot . The one thing I did find that I did n't like was the lack of background into Klaatu 's past that was the only thing I found I did not like . This 2008 update brings a certain feeling of moral sense about what is going on in the environment it 's a story that tells us that if we do n't change our ways we 'll all die . Which is partly true but what really drew me to this film was it 's dark nature , I mean one alien has come to our planet to deiced our fate by judging whether or not we are fit to continue to live on this planet . It 's a great change your ways story that seems to leap off the screen and drag you into it 's world of chaos and destruction . But ti did have a righteous pull to it as well I mean it was trying to tell us that we 've got this one world and this one life and we need to cherish as best we can and to mean that made it great to watch . Keanu Reeves turns in an amazing performance as the otherworldly hit man \/ judge and he brings a dark forbearing and boding sense of justice and style to a very old character , Jennifer Connelly does well here as the widowed scientist Helen Benson . Jon Hamm showcase 's he 's got some good acting chops outside his Mad Men role and Kathy Bates is fantastic as always . The only weak link in the group was Jaden Smith , son of Two time Oscar nominee Will Smith , He gave such an annoying and bad performance that it made everyone else look bad he was bratty and crass and did n't really show off any real talent at all . But besides that the cast held up pretty well and did good with the material that they were given . This film is what you would call a dedication to the environment , an Eco friendly Science Fiction movie -LRB- which is very rare . -RRB- and that gives it more of an appeal to Eco fanatic 's and regular moviegoer 's . But what really takes it outside the conventional Sci-Fi thriller genre is it 's force and undeniable strength , it 's will is unstoppable and it 's grand and almost detailed way of telling the story makes it all the more powerful and amazing . The Day the Earth Stood Still is a force to be reckoned with it 's powerful , ingenious and oh so entertaining to the point that the passage of time is meaningless . All in all T.D.T.E.S.S. is an enthralling and mesmerizing Sci-Fi adventure to see it 's wild fun and the fans of the original will love it if they give it a chance . This film rocked my world and I know if your forgiving it will rock yours as well . The day the earth stood still is an event you do n't want to miss . " ,8
" Low expectations , pleasantly surprised . . I have never seen the original movie and probably never will as I have been spoilt severely by overexposure to modern day special effects . I therefore have no desire to see cardboard sets and egg-carton robots with ` scary ' light-bulb lasers -LRB- sorry original film fans -RRB- . Having nothing to compare this film to I think gives me an advantage . I wanted to see this film purely because I always enjoy watching Keanu Reeves and was interested to see him paired with Jennifer Connelly as he always seems to work the chemistry well with his leading ladies . I was n't expecting much from this film as I 'm not a huge fan of 50 's sci-fi , however I was gripped from the first appearance of the space bubble and the scenes of apocalyptic Manhatten -LRB- where else ! -RRB- to the ` nail biting to the quick ' finish . I rarely watch a film that I do n't criticise at least a little when it 's over but this just did it for me . It entertained me from start to finish , what more can you ask . I even enjoyed Will Smith 's kid 's performance , he was so cute and funny standing up to Claatu . Hurrah to the cast and crew . Do n't let the haters get you down , this film will do well on DVD and stand the test of time to become a modern sci-fi classic . " ,9
" This film is much better than what the negative reviewers are saying , and here 's why ... . Once again , Hollywood makes yet another remake of a classic film , and while most attempts at this have been utter disasters , this remake of `` The Day The Earth Stood Still '' is a rare exception to this rule and deserves far more praise than what is being displayed by the negative reviews here on IMDb . First , the scenario is equally as chilling as the original : Alien visitors arrive to Earth , this time in beautiful , yet ominous looking sphere-shaped spacecraft . The first lands in the middle of central park in New York city and thus begins a very realistic , and intense standoff between humans and the new arrivals . The anticipation was superb and anyone who was not sitting on the edge of their seat during this part was either a. -RRB- Stoned b. -RRB- Had no pulse or C. -RRB- Both . Second , the acting was brilliant , especially on the part of Kuneau Reeves as Klaatu , as well as Jennifer Connely and Kathy Bates . Very convincing performances that truly grabbed the attention of the audience . Finally , the story was a wonderful wake-up call for humanity without being `` preachy '' as some of the negative reviewers complained and you actually walk out of the theater with quite a bit to think about . It 's nice to see something from the current world of entertainment that is actually intellectually stimulating , especially from the realm of science fiction . Any director can have aliens blow up the world , but the director of this film blew our minds with a deep and meaningful plot . Also , I would like to add that , contrary to what negative reviewers have said , this film was not Al Gore in a cheap suit and did not contain anything about global warming . This was a fact that I was actually dreading due to the fact that I am sick of hearing global warming being crammed down our throats . I even thought to myself as I walked into the movie theater that if this film even mentions the phrase `` global warming '' , then I am prepared to walk out of the theater . Thankfully , however , it did n't and , needless to say , that was a relief . In conclusion I just want to say that while everyone is entitled to their opinion , I also feel that many of the negative reviewers of this film were a bit harsh in their judgments and sometimes I wonder if some of these negative reviewers , who really act like self-proclaimed critics , are n't just like that overweight comic book guy from `` The Simpsons '' with no life and with nothing better to do than to hack to pieces a decent film . No offense intended to anyone , but the vitriol being spewed by some of the negative reviewers really makes me think that the afore mentioned point is the case . Is this film a masterpiece ? No . However , it does hold a candle to the original quite well and is definitely worth a viewing . " ,8
" One of the worst big-budget movies I 've ever seen ... Maybe the worst . I 'm seen some lousy movies before . I 've seen some pretty stupid adaptations and some really crappy remakes -LRB- Night of the Living Dead 3D , anyone ? -RRB- . But this takes the cake . Considering the talent involved , the obvious money spent , and the public hype surrounding this flick ... It was god-awful . Plan 9 From Outer Space has serious competition for `` worst film of all time , '' if you take budget and acting talent into consideration . How such a tanker can be made with such a big price tag and several skilled names attached is far , far beyond me . How someone -LRB- the actors , the CGI animators , ANYONE ! -RRB- did n't take notice of any of the glaring plot holes or absolute lack of a real ending ... Sweet pampered baby Jesus . Someone must have taken notice , though , because it seems , at some point , everyone stopped caring . The CGI was disgusting ... I 'm no fan of CGI , but I know sometimes , with the combination of the way a story and shot list are written and the global expectations people put on modern films , it 's necessary to carry out an idea . I 've seen better CGI implemented in student productions . NOTHING looked believable , and it looked as if the animators did n't even bother to try to make it so . The dialog was terrible and clunky , and the story -LRB- and ending -RRB- were so insufficient and full of holes that it 's astounding it even got put out . There WAS no real ending ... Millions dead , cities destroyed , and a world covered in a fine sand of mechanical space-bugs . Then what ? The director did n't even put his name at the end , or any other associated `` big '' names , it went straight to smaller production people . Most likely ? Because they were ashamed . And I wo n't even bother comparing it to the original . While dated , I 'm watching the original as I type this , and it 's become a bit corny and campy with age , but it 's whimsy and wonder , and given message , is still shining after half a decade . This new one ? Trash . Anything for money , it seems . " ,1
" Truck-loads of Crap . An absolutely crap movie . Do n't remember the last time I saw such a good star cast being wasted because of a dumb storyline or screenplay . Stay away please . Keanu Reeves with his black coat resembles the matrix minus the glasses . But the good part of the comparison just stops there . He seems to try to act like a robot + human + what not ... may be a terminator types The climax is not convincing enough and the special effects makes me feel I am still watching the 1950 's version . Only good part of the movie is that there is not much of sci-fi thrown in it . It is easy to understand the movie . " ,1
" Solid sci-fi . It was certainly better than I expected and better than trailer of it was . Overall it 's deeper and more epic than original 1951 film , and of course very modern-day . This one gives some really powerful messages and show our world from ironic -LRB- and not very happy -RRB- perspective . Acting from main actors was solid . Keanu Reeves was really cool . Special effects are fine , thought there is not much of action in this movie . The only annoying thing I guess was lots of product placement , they even show World of Warcraft on full screen for I think 5 seconds or more . It maybe not the freaking amazing mindblowing movie , but a surprisingly high quality science fiction , that 's very rare these days . " ,10
" I thought that it was good . Everyone just please relax !!! . I really liked this movie . I saw it last night -LRB- opening night -RRB- , and I saw the original film a couple nights before that . Who cares if its ' a little bit different ! I enjoyed it , because it was a well made movie . I do n't understand critics these days . Again , who cares if its ' a little bit different than the original ? I loved it , and most other people that I know did enjoy it as well . It had a good amount of action , drama , and there was also a good amount of humor added to the story line as well . Overall , I really enjoyed the movie , and yeah , it was a little different than the original . When it really comes down to it , is it really that big of a deal that the story was changed a little bit ??? 10\/10 " ,10
" Awards are sure to follow . . It 's always tricky with remakes particularly as those who like the original will always be critical of the newcomer however well intentioned and efficiently made . I have no issues with Hollywood exploring its vaults as long as the eventual film is entertaining and is value for money - a Cape Fear or Oceans Eleven . However taking the plot from an old movie and adding a few modern special effects hoping it will work is simply just not enough . Compound the problem by having a script that draws on every sci-fi clich in the book , have a soundtrack that constantly reminds you that ` danger is near ' or ` something creepy is about to happen ' , and ensure that the lead roles are just stereotype after stereotype after stereotype , and you get , probably , the worst movie I have seen in years . The plot has Keanu Reeves being abducted\/simulated in the past , not sure which , then along with a big old earth like globe he lands in Central Park in the modern day . The Government is weary of the UFO and therefore utilises the military to prepare for an attack whilst observing the alien . The alien now morphs into Keanu Reeves , who was accompanied by a giant robot like being that stays in the Park . Is he and the big globe here to help us or to kill us all ? Well , yes that 's basically it . There 's a lot of shooting , by the military , a bit of soul searching by the scientists , an adopted young boy with issues with parenting , the kids mother who is important enough to bypass security checks at military control centres . I 'm sorry , I ca n't go on with this drivel . In summary Keanu Reeves is just a piece of talking wood , Jennifer Connelly spends most of the movie saying ` give us a second chance , we can change !! ' - saying it once is poignant , say it a dozen times and it 's just irritating . I feel sorry for Oscar winner Kathy Bates who plays the Government official who has to make all the tough decisions but is a tortured soul in the process , yes the role really is that shallow , her agent should be shot for their involvement in her taking the role . As pointless as a movie gets adding nothing new to the sci-fi genre . Oh and those awards I mentioned , the 29th Annual Razzie Awards , expect the mantelpiece to be full . " ,1
" I came to save the Earth . . I was expecting to come away totally negative on this film , especially since the 1951 original is one of my personal Top Ten favorites . Though a lot of the original material is maintained and expanded upon , the feeling I got was n't so much that this was a remake , but more of a sequel to the earlier picture . That 's because when the 1951 film ended , one 's take away is that maybe , just maybe , citizens of Earth would take heed of Klaatu 's warning and reverse course on the path to Armageddon . Back in the Fifties , it seemed that the U.S. and Russia were on a trajectory to annihilate each other via nuclear war . My own view , relative to the first film , was that Man would never ` get it ' , and the prospect of Klaatu taking matters into his own hands , would eventually have to come back and fulfill his doomsday prophecy . In a way , that 's where this picture begins . Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- has returned , and it 's with a goal to complete the mission begun almost sixty years earlier . That actually might have been the better stated approach from the get-go instead of going the remake route . This time around , Klaatu is n't so willing to learn about and understand human behavior the way Michael Rennie 's character was . He already KNOWS that humans are so dysfunctional in the way their nations , religions and races behave , that they do n't WANT to change . This seems to be at the core of the film , and the repeated promises to do so by Jennifer Connelly 's character seem hollow at best . That 's why the resolution of the film seems so empty . Klaatu 's decision to intervene on behalf of humanity is based on the singular reaction he has to the family dynamic between Helen Benson -LRB- Connelly -RRB- and her adopted son -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- . Seriously , what analytically minded alien would possibly be swayed on that basis ? What if , for example , Klaatu had sat in unobserved on your typical United Nations meeting ? Or had observed the nuclear buildup of a country like Iran threatening to bring the world to the brink as it surely will in a few short years ? Or the way despots the world over live like kings while their people barely survive in abject poverty . I guess in my version of The Day The Earth Stood Still , Klaatu would have snapped his fingers and brought the world to a halt the way he did in both films , but do it permanently . You want to get serious about peace in our time and save the planet - then you make it impossible for one country or it 's leader to inflict their will on another . Or , alternatively , you just wipe out the entire human race . But there 's no box office with that alternative , so we 're left with the less than satisfying finale . All that 's not to say I did n't find some positives with the picture . I liked the concept of Klaatu being composed of three different organisms , and the acronym of GORT referring to a Genetically Organized Robotic Technology . Quite honestly , I 'm relieved the picture did n't take the approach of trying to outdo it 's contemporaries in the over the top action department , relegating those instances to showcasing Klaatu and Gort 's power in a more strategic way . For all that though , one has to look at Professor Barnhardt 's -LRB- John Cleese -RRB- admonition with some suspicion . It may be true that At the precipice , we change . The only problem with that is - A few weeks later , we forget . " ,8
" Good but Flawed Remake . I 'll start out by saying that I am , in fact , a fan of the original and it does deserve its spot in the IMDb top 250 . Now , I am not a die hard fan , therefor , I did not go into this movie very mad that they remade the original like I was with Halloween . The acting is quite good . They 've got Keanu Reeves , Jennifer Connelly , Cathy Bates , etc. . A great cast . I was very relieved to see that , even though Klaatu had powers , he did n't completely remind me of Neo . I very much liked all of the characters , despite some needed development . The movie also has some decent affects and Gort looks more bad ass than ever . And that 's not just talking about how he looks . I was happy to see that he did more than just stand there and look pretty , though I felt his introduction could have used some work . Last , the ending was good and satisfactory despite a bad line from little Smith . Professor Berhardt -LRB- I probably spelled that wrong -RRB- was one of my favorite characters in the original , yet he only gets about five minutes of screen time here and about four lines of ideologue . Like I said above , the characters were a bit underdeveloped . After work , the mother gets home , has an argument with her son , then she is picked up by people in suits . I would have had the audience see what these characters go through in there daily lives and then have the guys pick her up when she goes to bed . The lack of development also causes the movie to feel a bit rushed . I mean , they had plenty of time , why rush it ? Last , the phrase Klaatu Barrada Nikto is there , though it 's barely heard and , being that there is no true definition for these words , they could have put it into any situation in the film . Last , the movie is called THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL yet it did n't have a very global feel to it . And then there 's the McDonalds scene . Overall , this is a fun popcorn flick with plenty of action , believable characters , and some witty , sometimes humorous ideologue . " ,8
" The Day the Earth Stood Still , apt , given that the Earth did n't move for this one . . This film is a shrugged shoulder . It 's a horizontally held hand teetering from side to side . It 's ` meh ' , or ` alright ' or ` ok ' . Strangely , working in the movie business -LRB- store assistant in a rental shop ... :--LRB- -RRB- People give this film incredible reviews . But the same people have also come in telling me how rubbish Saw IV was , and promptly rented Saw V when it first came out ! Overall , I watched the film , which , for me to not be distracted during is a miracle . But I did n't really remember much once it had finished . I remember something to do with Neo saving the annoying kid who I wished would have died , as that would have construed , to me , a happy ending . But the fact that Mr. Reeves has not played any other character since Bill and Ted aside , this film lacked the wow factor it could have had . I rated it a seven because , I think people should watch it , whether they have seen the original or not . But , ultimately , a 7 is a failure for a film of this budget , and of its kind . Sci Fi are some of the biggest grossing movies around and for this one to feel so ... not dull but more , ordinary , is a shame . If you missed it on the big screen it 's worth a rent , but you probably wo n't wish to watch it twice . " ,7
" Excellent . . Yep , another remake of a movie rated with 5\/10 because people who saw the original movie first ca n't help but point out the flaws instead of realizing that both movies are just two different movies by two different directors who made the movie the way they want it and still kept some important details , and sometimes take some important details out . If you just pretended you were watching an original movie and you never saw the other one , that 's how you should review . That being said , I loved this movie and I do not plan to watch a poorly made 50s movie with a huge lack of CGI and effects . But , who knows ? Maybe I will watch it . One thing that bothers me is the boy . Jacob is so annoying that you just want to go up into his face and tell him to shut up . I really dislike when he butts in on the story . He walks out of the car , walks to a different part of the forest and makes the scene emotional instead of exciting , and I hate when he complains about how much he loves his father , because we 've all seen this in movies before and I 'm just sick of it . In the movie , the world is going to end . Just shut up and worry about yourself , then worry about your father after Human Civilization changes and all coffins in the world are destroyed so humans can decompose naturally . This movie was excellent . At first , the extraterrestrial who looks like a regular Human being but not at first when he sheds his skin , was very annoying when he talked . `` I do not know that of which you are speaking to be concerned with us and that is the final thing because she is . '' There 's no that 's and she 's and it 's . Maybe once in a while , but he pretty much pauses after one word like Race to Witch Mountain . I wonder if the old one of both movies did that . But , what ever . This movie was excellent any way . I enjoyed how the one who listens to the president , the eyes and the ears of the president I guess is what I should be typing , acted . She was not too bossy , she gave in , she wanted to convince the aliens that we will change . The president only said one thing that would change her plans , so that was pretty much the only sign of the president being stupid . Most likely , it was Bush because . . 2008 . Yeah . Overall , this movie is excellent , and all in good fun . It has a message , but at least it did n't give it in the way Plan 9 From Outer Space did , too . Also , if you hate sci-fi movies set completely at night and rarely in light , you 'll love this . It proves that extraterrestrials can come at night , and still be alive at day . " ,9
" Way over my Expectations . When i first read some comments i thought , it would n't be much entertaining , watching this movie . I just watched it yesterday and i was pleasantly surprised . The story was quite entertaining and it was fascinating . Maybe there where some illogically scenes in this movie , but hey it 's a movie ! In my opinion , there 's is no need to be extremely logical when it 's a Sci-Fi Movie or an Action Movie either . The acting was good , but not extraordinary . Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly did well in this movie . And i did n't feel bored at any point in this movie . So it 's an 8 out of 10 for me ... " ,8
" The Day I Loved a Film Everyone Else Hated . Reading other reviews for this film you could be forgiven for thinking it 's an absolute stinker created solely to make money off ` green propaganda ' . I disagree ; it gripped me from the opening scene with Tyler Bates ' haunting score complementing the snowy Indian mountains perfectly , right up to a fine and original ending which seems to have passed many by , such is its brevity . I 've lost count of the number of reviews that claim the script to be simplistic and one dimensional , swiftly followed by statements complaining about the vague ending , which it is n't in the least . The last minute explains both the title of the film and what happens next in absolute terms . The special effects seem to have garnered criticism and maybe it did n't look as good on the big screen but it looks phenomenal on mine -LRB- 47 HD -RRB- . Am i watching the same film as everyone else ? I feel it 's worth mentioning the photography because it 's a beautiful film , the aliens and their ships are unique , ethereal and are always basked in mist or snow to great effect . It 's such a visual film that the script is fairly minimal , but what there was satisfied me enough . Despite reading about ` preachy ' moments , there are n't any , it 's the general theme that i believe people object to , which is the real tragedy and almost proves the films entire point - people do n't change unless they absolutely have to . Keanu was the perfect casting for Klaatu - however you look at it - and i loved the sinister undertones that he carried whilst never coming across as self righteous . The only missed opportunity i felt was the meeting of Klaatu and John Cleese 's genius professor which did n't advance the plot and slowed the pace . I was enthralled from the start , liked the updated theme from the original and enjoyed it throughout . 9\/10 " ,8
" do n't listen to the dumb-ass critics who trash this movie . I 'm getting really tired of having to wade through the piles of self-promoting crap that people on the IMDb leave nowadays in the guise of a review . I just read a review on this movie by a guy who wrote paragraph upon paragraph of bullshit about how lousy this movie was and then signs it at the bottom -LRB- not forgetting to type in his middle name -RRB- with a link to his website . -LRB- And the site is down by the way . -RRB- Everybody is entitled to their opinion , alright , but do n't trash a movie when you clearly are either A -RRB- only doing it so that you can practice some form of cerebral masturbation or B -RRB- do n't get it at all . Yes this is a remake and I think it was a damn good one ! It took the ideas from the original and adapted it to today 's political , social and environmental climates . That 's what a good remake does . It does n't copy it imitates , there 's a difference . Some people say that the message in the movie is heavy-handed . If the world was n't full of pollution , War , Famine , and Death ... if the Earth were n't dying because of us , I might agree . But seriously , you 've got to be kidding . Heavy-handed ? Jeezus ! It 's not heavy enough ! I suppose that some could view this as propaganda by the peace-mongering , tree-huggers who care about the future of mankind ... but I digress . This is first an action\/sci-fi popcorn movie with a pretty serious theme . It also has just the right mix of suspense and intrigue to keep it intellectually interesting as well as lots of CGI effects to keep it visually exciting . I thought the acting was good ; Keanu Reeves played the part as well as anyone could . He 's an alien who views the human race as a cancer that needs to be treated . -LRB- Is n't there some irony here as that is what Agent Smith said to Morpheus in the first Matrix ? -RRB- He 's suppose to act indifferent and almost a little bored . He can because he holds all the cards . The bottom line is if you like a movie with topical social commentary , lots of action and special effects , aliens and cool , out-of-this-world technology as well as a good plot and good acting then check it out . no name , no website " ,8
" A very good effort . The day the Earth Stood Still a remake of the 50 's movie of the same name is a very interesting movie , it has very good action and adventure , the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat . A sci-fi movie with a very actual theme . The story is very interesting and the plot about an creature from outer space arrived to the Earth to give a message to all the world leaders , change your way of living and your feelings or prepare to be destroyed , is very good developed and convincing . The special FX are excellent . The cast was good , Keanu Reeves in the role of Klaatu was good although it sometimes remind me of Neo in The Matrix , Jennifer Connelly was convincing , Kathy Bates excellent and Jaden Smith was also good although his role turns to be a little annoying at the end with all his whining at the end . In conclusion , the movie is a very good effort to get entertained , a very good choice for those sci-fi fans . " ,8
" Full of flaws ... but the movie 's message ai n't one of them . . `` The Day the Earth Stood Still -LRB- 2008 -RRB- '' , a painfully misunderstood remake , is not quite the generic disaster I -LRB- as countless others -RRB- was expecting fro H-wood . Instead , I got a surprising and mildly effective slap in the face , and while the movie 's message should have and easily could have -LRB- ! -RRB- struck a stronger chord with the masses -LRB- like `` WALL-E '' managed -RRB- , I fear it will be , sadly , silenced by harsh and unjust criticism , which in most cases surprisingly sees it as an inadequate remake of the 1951 movie . Undeservingly so , and I hope I can make my case ... Whereas the second half of `` WALL-E '' touched upon the subject of human negligence and thoughtless dependence on technology , it 's first half also showed our planet in a state that somehow does n't seem nearly as far fetched as it would have 20 or 30 years ago . This movie gives its perspective on this disaster . Sure , it 's total sci-fi , but that should n't steer away from the actuality of our current problems . I 'm no fundamental environmentalist , nor do I buy into the C02 craze because of a couple of charts , but what I definitely do see is the rapid demise of nature around us , in all shapes , forms , and sizes . If you disagree , here 's where we should probably part ways . If not , let me conclude my review by mentioning the recurring and symbolic consistencies that are present in both the 1951 movie and this -LRB- almost justifiable -RRB- remake , although most viewers seem to have missed them and bash this movie for reasons of pure nostalgia . Both movies came out in a time of global panic -LRB- the brink of cold war\/global warming and natural disasters -RRB- , both movies have more or less the same story-line , which is heavy on the symbolic -LRB- alien comes to warn the humans of their future actions regarding this panic . If he succeeds nobody knows and only time will tell -RRB- , and both movies crudely , yet effectively , present this message to the viewer . The 1951 movie is retrospectively regarded as one of the more powerful and inspirational movies of its time , and looking back , how can we not see these attributes . This 2008 version definitely lacks the nostalgic sparkles , could have used a more polished script and some better thought-out scenes and casting options -LRB- Keanu is surprisingly not one of them , Connelly neither -RRB- , but is in its core a very powerful movie , much more than it will get credit for ! Had it been given into the hands of a more experienced director who would have relied more on human interaction than on generic CG , and had it been freed of the curse of being a remake for the sake of a warmer critical reception -LRB- which , although I am totally against remakes , I HAVE TO make an exception in this case , solely on the symbolic and historic relevance both movies carry -RRB- , well ... Whatever the outcome , I hope that future generations will indeed look back on this movie , and see it as the shouting expression of events , occurring in the beginning of the 21st century . But what if our Earth does decide to stand still somewhere along the way ? " ,7
" Save your Money . Where to start ? Well there is no resemblance between this remake of the classic . The plot has been re-worked , and except for minor things , this in no way resembles the original movie . I thought Keanu Reeves was marginal in `` The Matrix '' - but this removed all doubt . Keanu Reeves again plays a `` contact lens '' depth of character . Very little emotion , almost a sterile performance . He was so monotone , that I had to fight staying awake through the movie . His droning voice , nearly bored me to death . Plot is pretty predictable , but there is no `` benevolence '' really shown by the character . The thin acting , did not hide the fact , that the plot also was thread-bare . The special effects were good , but not superior . They did NOT really enhance my viewing pleasure , oh make me go `` OOOH ! AHHH ! '' It was , more like `` Blah ! '' I 'll be generous and give this movie 1.5 reels out of 5 . Definitely NOT worth the bucks ! Wayno Tucson , Az " ,1
" The Day the Earth Sat Bored . Awful , drawn out , boring Hollywood crap . And that about sums it up . Nothing seems to happen in this movie . It 's a typical Alien comes to earth , stupid earth people shoot alien , alien almost destroys the world , changes mind , end of movie . The only kewl looking thing in the entire movie was the giant cylon looking robot . But they barely used it . The soundtrack was typical Hollywood , `` attempting to make an epic film here '' using lots of classical music . Nothing really big seemed to happen until the last few minutes of the movie and even that was unimpressive . Felt like I wasted my time . I think Keanu should go back to doing action movies . " ,1
" World Exclusive : J S Bach saves world from Aliens and Madeline Albright . This film was completely empty and boring and was n't saved by some good special effects . The story was unoriginal -LRB- not referring to the 1951 version -RRB- in that we have had an overabundance of these catastrophic humanity-on-the-edge-of-extinction baloney types , that one would think that U.S. film and T.V. makers are trying to promulgate and copper fasten an ever impending attack psyche among Americans , convincing them of imminent attacks from either aliens or human terrorist types , for whatever reason or other you can make up your own mind . Personally , I think that we do n't have to worry about aliens eradicating us , as humans will do that job unaided - but that 's another story . Firstly , if the aliens obviously knew what kind of half-arsed job we humans had made of things so why land here at all , why not blow the proverbial out of us from space ? For all their advanced technology , they lacked the basics of extinction warfare . And the way that the giant bodyguard dissolved into a scrillion little robotic metal-eaters , what was that all about ? Also , the small arks that took away all other life forms to , presumably , return them at a later stage , surely it would have been easier to hypnotise the humans , take them away and leave everything else rather than eating the crap out of all and sundry ? And what about Klaatu , rethinking his hideous mission , after seeing a few unconvincing tears and hearing a bit of tinkling of a Bach tune , so therefore the whole years-in-the-planning operation is gone for a Burton . As pathetic as the story was what about the acting , especially Mr. Reeves who after all , plays a half robot but still managed to convince me that his other half was a robot as well , and could John Cleese have been any more of a stereotype wearing a cardigan that must have came from a small flock of sheep , sporting a pair of absent-minded slippers , having a strategic blackboard in the sitting room , listening to Bach in a house needing a bloody good clean-up . All that was missing was a thoughtful pipe and an even more silly hairdo . Even Kathy Bates ' impersonation of Madeline Albright could n't save this one . I say watch the original . " ,1
" Updated remake will make you stand still , jaw agape . The Day the Earth Stood Still is remade as a taut , electric thriller that 's updated to shift humanity 's crime from `` being bad to one another '' to `` assaulting the environment . '' It 's well cast , particularly with Keanu Reeves as Klaatu and Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Helen Benson , and it lags only when the action departs , which is n't too often at all . In all , it 's a clever redo that will capture the viewer 's imagination even if they 've seen the original . The key word here is `` update . '' I think that if you 're going to remake a classic , you should do so if you can show a different angle , a new twist , to the original plot without decimating the original premise in the process . Here , director Scott Derrickson stays true to Klaatu 's main point - fly right or fall - while altering some aspects of the original to better suit the times . For example , the robot Gort is n't just a big metal thing , he\/it is a metal-organic hybrid , because naturally alien civilizations might have advanced past mere robotics . So why is Klaatu here , anyway ? Well , in general terms he 's here to warn us to mend our ways , or else , but he does n't get too far by trying to reason with us . As one might expect , since we do n't take kindly to aliens landing in Central Park . Klaatu is eventually apprehended and interrogated , just as we 'd expect the narrow-minded government to do . And he meets up with Dr. Helen Benson -LRB- Connelly -RRB- , a macrobiologist called in by the feds to figure out what the heck 's going on . Connelly and Reeves interact well , although it 's tough to tell sometimes , since Klaatu is n't supposed to be the emotive type . But of course , neither is Reeves , which is why he 's so well cast . In fact , perfectly so . Klaatu is measured in his responses and actions , and you never really know what his plans are ; Reeves enigmatic demeanor is suitable . Connelly is believable as the single - -LRB- step -RRB- mom\/superdoctor , too . She and Reeves are n't love interests here , which also contributes a lot to the efficacy of the plot . Too often straightforward stories are derailed somewhat by a forced romance angle . Not here . In this remake , the conflicts between man and alien , man and man , man and self are at center stage . And that gets at the crux of why this movie works : the impending doom of the planet is shown so vividly that you ca n't help but feel fearful yourself . Will Dr. Benson be able to convince Klaatu that the humans should be saved ? What will happen , specifically , if she can not ? Her trepidation grips you ; knowing that the fate of the planet 's dominant species rests on your shoulders is a fearsome burden . The downsides ? Well , there are n't many , to be sure , but they do kind of hurt . Jaden -LRB- son of Will -RRB- Smith is cast as Benson 's stepson , and he 's surly and unforgiving and combative and just plain unlikable . Which is n't strictly young Master Smith 's fault , certainly , but it makes it awfully hard to feel sympathy toward him . It 's a little gallling , too , to see his attitude turn on a dime , in mere seconds , as if the first 45 minutes were just a big joke . I also was n't too pleased with Kathy Bates as the secretary of defense , who 's inexplicably left in charge of matters after the arrival of Klaatu and Gort . -LRB- Why not the president or veep ? Oh , they 're moved to separate undisclosed locations , where apparently they ca n't do anything . -RRB- Autocratic , illogical commanders are a dime a dozen in the movies , and Bates feels completely wasted here . Still , this remake really is a lot of fun , particularly during the high-octane action scenes , which are understandable despite being infused with CGI . In this case , it appears that the CGI works very well - check out the giant robot Gort and how it reacts to being shot at . Technically speaking , very well done indeed . " ,7
" America , oh you are so great . This comment contains spoilers ! And a lot of nagging =-RRB- I have not seen the original but i looked forward to this movie since i like sci-fi . And it started of fair enough , all the worlds -LRB- meaning USA -RRB- masterminds are summoned because something is traveling at high speed towards earth . They are basically told that the earth is about to be destroyed within 76minutes . Why these masterminds needed to hear this , or why the military is preparing for an assault of mass proportion -LRB- when they think its a meteorite -RRB- is never explained . So far , the mood of the movie is good with only a few question marks . And it does n't get much more complicated either . The basic story of the movie is still good and interesting . But everything seems to be a big commercial about how great USA is instead of the vulnerabilities of the human kind . It turns out that the thing which were about to collide with earth landed instead . Obviously in central Manhattan USA . No other objects were found by whatever system that detected this one , yet they say that these kind of gigantic orbs have landed all over earth -LRB- but who cares -RRB- . Anyways , they capture an alien who knows the English language and everything about humankind because they have taken control over American satellites . The captured alien wants to meet with all of earth leaders but his wishes are denied by the vice president or some other extension of the president of USA . He will only need to speak to the president of USA -LRB- off course ! -RRB- . Furthermore the DNA collected from the alien will not be analyzed for decades , since it 's now property of the USA . This movie is full of this sort of commercials\/propaganda and it does nothing for the story . Also , there is product placement for at least McDonalds , Honday -LRB- the car -RRB- , LG -LRB- phone service -RRB- , Microsoft Windows , and probably many more . What we learn from movies from Hollywood is the following : \* If a disaster is threatening to the humankind the epicenter will be in America for some reason . \* If the disaster is some kind of attack it will be towards America cause that 's were it would hurt mankind the most off-course . \* Where ever and\/or whatever the disaster is , it will be solved by America -LRB- ns -RRB- . I am no `` USA-hater '' , people may think that America is the greatest nation of earth , maybe it 's so . I do n't know , it 's possible . I just do n't like it when movies aim towards this . Its almost as if there 's kind of board in the movie industry which have to acknowledge the movies and check so that there 's enough USA-love in it . Anyway all the above comments are annoying features of the film , but it 's still rather enjoyable to watch . I saw it on its premier and i do n't think it 's worth paying for , i give it a four -LRB- 4 -RRB- out of ten -LRB- 10 -RRB- Klatuu was believable and graphics OK , that 's all . I 'd would have liked to know more about the origin of the aliens `` community of nations '' and in what way humankind was destroying itself -LRB- climate , religion or war ?? -RRB- . " ,4
" Unaccomplished remake , a waste of Connely 's talent and time . . Jennifer Connely , Keanu Reeves and young Jaden Smith -LRB- son of Will -RRB- head up the cast for this remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic where an extra-terrestrial robot visits Earth to turn the human race away from their own annihilation , warning them that the continuation of their warfare will instigate it . Much like other highly applauded films inspired by politics -LRB- ` The Manchurian Candidate ' for instance -RRB- the relevancy and strong message procure half the artistic value . Back then , the crisis was named Cold War . Now , it 's called Global Warming . Unlike ` The Manchurian Candidate 's ' remake , this one does n't work very well . If I say ` The War of The Worlds ' by Spielberg outclasses TDWESS , some alarm bells should be ringing . While Connely occasionally lifts up the level , the internal logic of the story annoys . The fact that Klaatu only reveals it 's true purpose -LRB- saving ` earth ' from mankind -RRB- late in the movie can only stem from shortage of plot . Which makes the abrupt and unfulfilling ending even more bizarre and laughable . On one hand you have enough time to stretch Klaatu and Connely 's character 's interactions with an unnecessary road trip , on the other hand the storyline 's ending is sloppy . The last scenes are supposed to be the most engrossing but left us only shrugging our shoulders . Other elements that should have everyone scratching their heads ... an underpass is hardly enough protection against a storm of death . It does n't help either that the supposed strong suit -LRB- and the only praise I read about it as of yet -RRB- , the CGI makes the robot a rather laughable stick figure instead of a terrifying , indestructible alien . Countering those major flaws are a masterfully acted cameo by John Cleese as a Nobelprize winning scientist and the occasionally conveying all the world 's worries , eyes of Jennifer Connely . Good remakes are few and far between . Especially compared to ' I Am Legend ' , that other recent Apocalyptic recreation of a Classic , it comes out looking poorly . 4\/10 , and I 'm really not being too harsh . " ,4
" Pretty good . I expected to see a bad movie , when I saw the rating is now . But , I am surprised that the movie is not bad at all . It 's pretty good . It 's a bit preachy . But it is supposed to be a preachy movie . We sometimes all need a lecture to learn . Other than this , the movie might have some unrealistic depiction of how the government handles the situation . But overall , the movie is great . The original movie is good too . Keenu is good . The original movie 's alien behaves too much like a human . The movie 's depiction of alien 's ability is pretty reasonable too . I found Connelly is doing a great job too . The Arc proposal is also great . Recommend you have a try . " ,8
" The Same Movie With a New Message . I am surprised at the negative comments on this movie , i thought it was a faithful and well made remake of the original -LRB- which i would also give it an 8 -RRB- . Keanu Reaves shines in this movie because a foux-human with undeveloped emotions is the only character he can play . -LRB- examples : Matrix , Speed -RRB- He makes Klaatu seem much more detached than in the original . I liked this because it seemed like in the original he was a little too human . The message from the original from nuclear war to our terrible treatment of `` our '' planet . this works a lot better since nuclear war never happened and our terrible treatment certainly did and continues to happen . The scene in the veteran 's graveyard is much better in this version and is by far the best scene in the movie . Gort is given a major upgrade , first off he does n't look like hes made out of milk cartons and it actually shows how he can destroy us not just hinting at it like in the original . Good acting all around with nice cameo from John Clease combined with familiar plot with good message as well as technically impressive CGI earns this movie an 8 out of 10 . " ,8
" Pretty awful amidst high expectations . This is one of those movies where the trailer is better than the actual film . Keanu Reeves is one of my all time favorite actors , in large part due to the Matrix trilogy , but he has failed astronomically here . 1951 would be livid . Where this movie peaks is when G.O.R.T. escapes from the underground chamber and havoc ensues . From there there is about 9 good minutes of movie and everything until the end falls short of amazing . The build up is incredible to the previous mentioned point of interest , but Jaden Smith 's character is such a turn off from what is actually going on it made me angry such a role for him was cast . His talent is beyond this and could have been utilized with a much better on screen persona . There was n't nearly enough destruction for the entire planet being in peril nor was there a true alien presence -LRB- Keanu plays an alien in a man 's body and G.O.R.T. has bad timing with Iron Man being released recently -RRB- that enthralled me like the blips in the trailer did . If you like being let down by all means ... you wo n't even be entertained with the special effects in this one . " ,4
" Why so many negative reviews !?? . I consider myself a demanding viewer , and to be honest , I rented the Blu-ray to the updated Day the Earth Stood Still because it included the original in HD as well ; but damned if I was n't quite impressed with this re-imagining of the original . Most of you reading probably know the 1951 film inside and out , and this story is fundamentally loyal to it . However , the new version offers a modernized slant - since the original story probably would n't work today - and I found much of it to be very compelling . Some of the special effects , and the technological ideas , are real welcome standouts , and made up for ` bright light ' spaceships , which have never really flown for me . -LRB- pun not intended , but I 'll take credit for it -RRB- The choice of Keanu Reeves in the role of Klaatu is ideal , with the interrogation and train station scenes being real standouts . And what can one say about Jennifer Connelly , not one false note . Little Jaden Smith rocks too . And then there 's Gort . While I believe more could have been done with this imposing monster of a robot , and pound for pound , he does n't stand up to the menace of the original , he 's still pretty darn bad-ass . The ending seemed rather abrupt , but overall , I found this to be a solid rental . " ,7
" A Beautiful And Inspiring Movie . I do n't know how anyone can saw this movie was disappointing . First , the visual effects were very well done , and realistic . Second , the actors were very convincing , from the well known and talented Keanu Reeves , to the young actor Jaden Smith who was also very impressive . The dialog also made this movie very interesting . If one were to listen to the point of the movie and think about it , they would realize just how realistic this film is . If I had to list some words to describe this work of art , they would be - Moving , intelligent , and impressive . I do n't think this movie should be labeled as a remake . The Day The Earth Stood Still of 1951 , evolved into a modern marvel while keeping an important message ; a message that we all need to hear . This is honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen . " ,10
" A future classic . I think that on reading some of the comments here , maybe reviewers have been a little unfair . It 's been alluded to that Keanu Reeves is very wooden , but has it occurred to anybody it 's how it should be played . I think that trying to attribute human emotions to an alien is a huge mistake . I think this is a very good film that will one day be seen as a classic . The Shawshank Redemption bombed at the box office , look now . The Shining was hammered by the critics , yet is now considered a classic . One day , this film will be considered as such , and then I have no doubt that all those who decried this film will be slavering over its attributes . " ,10
" Do n't listen to the `` remake '' purists . My heavens , I have rarely seen so many sci-fi purists who think the 1950s were untouchable . Sure , they had the best actors , the least cheesy story lines , and by far the best computer graphics back then , right ? We believe so strongly in the ethic of saving the world that we should try to discourage anyone from liking this film , right ? It 's better if the moral of the film never reaches people 's ears ? Hardly . The Day the Earth Stood Still is a ride that is both important and moving . It 's just not a parroting of the original and that angers some people . The underlying theme , about global pollution , is understated and entirely avoids being preachy . Keanu Reeves is marvelous as the flat affect alien , and while he comes to love humanity that is also understated so it avoids being campy . There are no `` Hasta La Vista Baby '' moments in the film . The aliens are superbly ... alien . There are some special effects we have n't seen before in other films and a creative take . The one criticism I might make is the handling of the government -LRB- similar to Terminator 3 -RRB- does not feel at all realistic , with the dialogue and the settings feeling hollow . That being said , the decisions that the government takes make sense . The pacing is good as well , and the scene with John Cleese could have been milked for minutes but was compact and made its point all the better for it . The ending is wrapped up without the corny-sounding `` Klaatu Barada Niktu '' . Do you believe that humanity needs to save itself ? This is a film you should see . Are you skeptical given all the reviews you 've read ? If you are a thinker : just go see it . " ,9
" Pretty good sci-fiction film . I went to see this movie yesterday . I was sort of expecting -LRB- judging by the trailers -RRB- , an explosive movie with action all along . Well let me get this straight , people : THIS IS NOT AN EXPLOSIVE MOVIE ! So there you are warned . Many people who came out of the theater at the end of the film seemed bummed out . I even heard two boys say to each other that the movie was garbage because it lacked action . So yeah , there is a lot of action in the trailers , but that 's about all what there is really in the movie , if not , slightly more . But this film focuses more on Klaatu -LRB- Keanau Reeves , who is excellent in this movie -RRB- and his personality . He is an alien that came to Earth to exterminate the human race . Even though some of his actions are totally out of this world , he looks human , and towards the end of this film he has a change of mind , which proves that he has a heart . So in other words , he kind of is like a human . I usually include a small plot summary of the movie in my reviews but in this case , I sort of did it already in the first paragraphs . Keanau Reeves is excellent , and so is Jennifer Connelley , but the one that actually stole the show -LRB- according to me -RRB- , is the young Jaden Smith , which we saw in The Pursuit of Happiness in 2006 , in which he played with his impressive dad , the legendary Will Smith . Jaden , if you read this , YOU ROCK , BOY ! The special effects also were excellent , and that 's all what I have to say really . So in other words , with an entertaining bunch of actors and great visual effects , The Day the Earth Stood Still is a very good movie . That is , if you do n't expect it to be explosions and gunfires all along . " ,9
" Respects and extends the original -- good story , well done . Since I was a boy , I 've always loved the 1951 movie , The Day the Earth Stood Still . Of course , as I 've aged , the special effects that once seemed so compelling in the original now look amateurish . And the original seems heavy-handed in its message , complete with a rather patronizing speech at the end . This remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still does a number of things well . It stays faithful to the original story , both in general theme -LRB- about humans acting irresponsibly according to a cosmic standard -RRB- and down to details -LRB- even names of characters and specific scenes -RRB- . But it is n't a tired rehash ... it adds depth of character and explores plot lines and technological details that were left undeveloped in the original . It turns the original plot enough to keep everyone guessing . Certainly the special effects were extraordinarily improved , which made the story more believable . And it delivers its cautionary moral about human responsibility -LRB- and redeemability -RRB- in a far less preachy way . I thought the acting was terrific -- somewhat understated throughout , but that added to the realism . Keanu Reeves is a bit wooden throughout , but that seemed appropriate to a super - rational extraterrestrial . Jennifer Connelly did a great job balancing the role of scientist and emotional heart to the movie . In short , compelling story , great special effects , exciting interludes , good acting -- an enjoyable movie that went by fast . We had two teens with us who thought the movie was great -- some of the scenes might be scary for kids , though . Highly recommended ! " ,9
" TDTESS in a nutshell . alien gets out of spaceship , alien gets captured , alien escapes , aliens says he has to destroy the world , kid cries and a professor says something , alien says he misjudges humanity , alien flies home thats basically the whole film , why with every alien invasion film do they put the focus on one bloody human family ?! there 's already enough films with humans in them ! Reeves was basically just playing Neo again , Conelly and Smith were average and what was the point of Cleeves being in the film for about 2 minutes ? And why would the whole world riot because an alien object landed in Central Park while people actually in the area where calm and collective ? Very disappointed " ,4
" A terrible film . . I have n't seen the original -LRB- and now definitely do n't intend to -RRB- , but everything about this film was poor . Perhaps , you might think , the reasonable -LRB- ish -RRB- casting would give credit to the film . Sadly though , Keanu stays true to his rigid , un-emotive self in very close form to The Matrix but this time without the cool factor . Maybe the only lightening scene was John Cleese 's brief appearance . If your into appalling acting and dialogue , completely un-gripping , un-cohesive story lines and frankly boring , predictable SFX , then this is for you . " ,1
" Loved it ! Fun movie ~ ~ ~ . Do n't know why everyone 's uptight about it . Have n't seen the original and frankly , I do n't care . It was beyond my time , about 30 + years before I was born . Movie was loads fun . Do n't listen to the nerd rage going on here , movie was enjoyable and engaging . Although I admit that there were tons of plot holes I did n't quiet get , like sending the world 's best scientists on a suicide mission on a helicopter right above the crash site ... not gon na happen . Nevertheless , the story was engaging . Anyways , what really got me thinking after the movie was our current crisis ... our world IS dying . If things do n't shape up , expect sea levels to rise by like 10 feet , geez ! In regards to the movie , go see it for yourself ! " ,10
" Simply Magnific !!! . Last night I saw this excellent movie and I 'm still thinking about it . It 's one of those movies that I will never forget it 's message . It really has a deep and philosophical message that goes and grows from the beginning until the end of the movie . Maybe not everyone is capable to see it , but for me it was very clear . We , the humans , are just the inhabitants of Planet Earth not the owners of Earth and if we do n't take care of our home , we will not have a home any longer . I 've spell it as simple as possible , but this message is even deeper . Do we really deserve to be saved ? Can the human race really change ? These are the questions that really need an answer . The actors did a great job too , in transmitting the message and all the feelings involved in this great `` idea '' that might happen eventually . " ,10
" The day that Fox stopped caring . Let 's face it ; 20th Century Fox have n't had a good year . They have bombed at the box office with the intensely drab `` The Happening '' and `` The X Files : I want to believe '' and here , there still not back on track . This is another example of great source material not done to justice . It 's not as if I wanted to dislike this movie . I went in with reasonably high expectations most of which were not met . What does n't work with this movie is the exact same problem I had with 2005 's `` War of the Worlds '' . It starts off wonderfully , keeping you on the edge of your seat for most of that first act . From the moment were allowed incite to what were dealing with the tension is dropped , and from that point on it feels like were all merely going through the motions . Reeves is wooden , but what do you expect . It 's hard to complain when he fits the character so perfectly . Whether or not it was intentional his character benefits from his monotone vocals . Jennifer Connelly is outstanding once again bringing much needed emotion to a character that one paper could have been extremely on paper could have been extremely dispensable . We know she 's better than this and I 'm sure she knows this as well . Keanu Reeves tops this adaptation of the seminal 1951 sci-fi film The Day the Earth Stood Still with this 20th Century Fox production . Scott Derrickson -LRB- The Exorcism of Emily Rose -RRB- helms the story of an alien traveler , Klaatu -LRB- Reeves -RRB- , who heads to Earth along with his bodyguard robot , Gort , to deliver a warning of planetary destruction if the people of the world fail to bring peace to their civilizations . Jennifer Connelly , Jon Hamm , and Kathy Bates co-star in the Ryne Douglas Pearson-penned film . What `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' really stumbles over is its writing . You ca n't help at some of the drab dialogue that 's so daft even Jennifer ca n't pull it off . What 's stunning is just how ensemble the cast is . John Cleese makes one of the most ridiculous cameos in film history and Kathy Bates presence is barely notices , he character has room to develop but it never does . One aspect I simply ca n't fault is the special effects , they shimmer with flair and originality and even at moments that you could see it going horribly wrong the effect specialist never flinch Creating a realist environment and a one that one several occasions may just leave you startled at how astounding the effects are . None of this however excuses the lazy execution of what is still considered a Sci-Fi classic . What I hope myself and many others will gain from this experience is that stunning source material does n't confirm an adaptations success . This is the exact reason why I still have my doubts about `` The Watchmen '' . Verdict : no matter how competently the effects are used , the movie suffers tremendously from a lazy second and third act . The acting is perfectly passable and the story still has n't lost its charm but everything else feels stilted . The Day The Earth Stood Still may just be remembered as `` The Day The Earth Stopped Caring . '' " ,4
" Love It . I am a huge fan of the original movie . I thought this movie changed a bit too much but that was to be expected to keep up with the times . However , there was enough tribute to the old movie to make me happy . I always keep in mind that this is just a MOVIE and as such it is there for my entertainment and it succeeded very well in that degree . Everyone keeps talking about the helicopter being a CH-46 Navy\/Marine Helo , but the Army operates a CH-47 version which is essentially the same Helo . The only part I did n't like was the little brat kid . This movie certainly did n't disappoint me as much as the Tom Cruise War of the Worlds which was totally bogus . " ,9
" What a movie !!!!!!!! . This movie can be a very entertaining one . Good alien movie after a long period.Superb acting with Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly.The movie is extremely fast paced holds your attention throughout the entire film . Keanu Reeves as Klaatu , an alien messenger in human form . Jennifer Connelly as Helen Benson , a famed astrologist at Princeton University who is recruited by the government to study Klaatu . Jaden Smith as Jacob Benson , Helen 's rebellious eight-year old stepson . His conflict with his stepmother was worsened by the death of his father . " ,8
" Meh , I say , MEH ! . First off , I have not seen the original . On a unbiased opinion I thought that this film merited a meh , I 've seen better . For a ` Hollywood Blockbuster ' , I thought this film was flat . Klaatu could n't work out if he was good or bad -LRB- killing a guy then bringing him back to life merely to announce he was going to destroy the whole human race -RRB- , and Helen something who had a more important role in her family than stopping Klaatu . I could n't understand the moans about the lack of ` Gort ' . From what I can tell , he appeared after Klaatu was shot , was restrained , he destroyed missiles and smashed planes and tanks . Then he is taken away , they try to kill him and he dissipates into lethal dust and begins killing everyone and everything . GOrt did plenty and was well on his way to committing genocide . To that I will hear no moans of ` where 's Gort ???? ' OK . The plot was a bit thin , and some of the acting was odd -LRB- particularly , deadpan-and-beginning-to-rot Keanu -RRB- but I did n't think the film deserved the bad press . Sure its not a ` classic ' but it deserves higher recommendation . Meh , I say , MEH ! " ,4
" Remake of the 1951 classic . . The original Michael Rennie vehicle remains a Science Fiction classic . There is nothing wrong with a remake placing the action in a more contemporary time with modern concerns . The special effects are nice to look at , but nothing real outstanding . Which has me feeling a bit let down . Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu , the man of mystery with a huge robot companion ... this time coming out of a huge twirling orb . And that is just one of the many that have landed through the world . A young knowledgeable woman of science Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- and her stepson Jacob -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- get caught up in Klaatu 's ` friendly ' mission of saving the earth from its own inhabitants and their destructive ways . Kathy Bates is strong as Regina Jackson representing the U.S. President , as if it is America 's responsibility to save the world . Also in the cast : John Cleese , John Hamm , James Hong and John Rothman . " ,7
" Bad . . Worse . . Worst IMAX experience ever ... . And I thought `` WAR OF THE WORLDS '' was bad !!! I 'm not a huge fan of science fiction movies as a whole . But when I see movies like `` Aliens '' , `` A.I '' , `` The Matrix '' . . Somehow I wanted to believe that if made right , this genre could be much more than what is shown to us . This movie is so bad that at one point I was considering asking for money back in the IMAX . No plot , very badly edited , cheap special effects , above all the characters are so irritating . . you can not even imagine . I have never seen the original . But this one sucked in a big way . It started being bad ... got worse ended being one of the worst alien movies of all time . " ,3
" Far exceeds expectations . This movie far exceeded my expectations . The remake is going to appeal to a larger audience than the critics think , because it has a message that is relevant . And although the movie has a message , it 's not `` preachy '' , and the message is revealed as the story evolves . I watched the original 1951 cult movie , and the new movie is far better , in every way . The characters are more fleshed out , the plot is more believable , and of course the special effects are better . But its not just the special effects that make this a better movie than the original.I also enjoyed how this movie makes an attempt to get the science correct , while still telling an action packed story . " ,9
" Annoying . Is the best word to summarize this movie . It was lacking in every department . I was expecting something quite good judging by the trailer I saw a while ago coupled with the fact that I have a soft spot for this directors first film `` Hellraiser Inferno '' . Instead I go an Incoveniant Truth all over again but with Al GORT !!!! I mean come on the kid in this film is perhaps the most annoying person I have bore witness to in a movie EVER ! So much so that I just wanted the equally annoying Jennifer Connolly to give the brat a clip round the ear . I was actually hoping the annoying Alien played by the annoying Keanu would throw the kid into one of the annoying orbs -LRB- that do n't actually do very much -RRB- , or better still Pinhead from the aforementioned Hellraiser film would appear with his Rusty fish hooks on chains and damn the little tyke to an infinity in Hell for making me so annoyed . However I am not Annoyed that I went to see this movie as I got to see the bigger trailer for Terminator Salvation which looks amazing . Oh yeah but this film is annoying . Do n't bother ! " ,3
" Bit of a let down . Saw the trailer to this and it looked great so I could n't wait to take the family to see a preview . The warning signs were there when the cinema was virtually empty for an evening preview screening and it soon became apparent why , the plot is weak and flawed and there just is n't enough drama and intrigue to keep you that interested . Considering the storyline the film is n't ` big ' enough , for example a giant sphere from outer space warrants only a few cop cars and tanks instead of an army with thousands watching . I found myself wanting the film to end and when I spoke to others this seemed to be the general consensus , indeed no-one I spoke to seemed to have been impressed by it at all so overall a bit of a let down . " ,4
" If I wanted to spend time with a petulant child I 'd be a teacher . . The child is a metaphor for mankind ; I can only think that Scott Derrickson has a severe dislike of mankind as the child is excruciatingly annoying and it 's painful to spend a hour in the characters company . Child aside , the film never really gets going , tries to attain the moral high ground then gives it up for no good reason other than to draw the film to a close . Kathy Bates is good as a Condoleezza Rice inspired Secretary of Defense . I advise you wait 3 months and it will be in the special offer bin at Blockbuster and buy the original as it 's a much better film . " ,2
" Cinematographic touchdown . I consider this to be a good movie . Mainly so , because of Mr. K. Reeves controlled , ` economical ' , plain , meager , focused acting , but the story is also good . The original version made on 50 's was also a very good movie , but the times has changed . Science-fiction is actually rather difficult genre , if one wants to make somehow plausible movie with rather convincing story . Problem is not so much in lack of imagination , than in tendency to ` overlap ' the limits of good taste and finally end up in the mess . To present a sort of an epitome of it ; - if the volume of action in the movie EXCEEDS the strength of the STORY , it causes great problems in the narrative quality , losing cinemas explicit ` coherence ' . Imagination , elegance , rhythm , economy , sensitivity , strength of the narration and intensity -LRB- to name just a few ` elements ' -RRB- working TOGETHER in ` harmony ' reduces UNNECESSARY action , IF the film is to be taken -LRB- more -RRB- seriously . In -LRB- more seriously taken -RRB- Science-Fiction , fight JUST for the fight is pointless and naive . Conflict-situation should more like 'em phasize ' something , bring forth ` something ' in the culmination-phases rather than just brutally solve problems . Despite of the critics , the last `` Indiana Jones '' - movie was rather good in it 's narrative tempo and in adjustment all along . Final episode with ` Crystal Aliens ' was particularly well depicted , in my opinion . It 's very easy to spoil things , you see . Three main factors why I consider this movie `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- to be good -LRB- around 9 -RRB- are ; 1 . The Story 2 . Keanu Reeves 3 . Shooting . " ,9
" I want my money back . Where to start with this . the film is about an alien that sends him self down to earth to destroy earth and his mind is changed when he sees a little boy crying over a grave , Maybe i got the story all wrong but the film does n't really give you much to go by . I have a funny feeling that either Keanu Reeves was n't taking this film seriously or he was just doing a terrible job at acting . Keanus character is totally emotionless throughout the film and all his dialogue is brief and uninteresting , my personal favorite being `` who are you ? '' `` If i told you it would only scare you '' . If you value your money you will give this film a pass . " ,1
" Well thought of - It is a Wake-Up call ! . I almost believed the numerous reviews that criticized it . I 've watched Alien -LRB- s -RRB- series of sci-fi movies and this one I feel is much more meaningful . Keanu Reeves has done a great job , and also the other actors ! Visual effects are stunning , and the movie comes with a good message . It is a must see for all sci-fi buffs who are also deep thinkers . Giving 9 as I went in with very very low expectations and came out very impressed with the cinematography and delivery . At times I felt a few dialogs were week - but must give that much leeway . I also felt that the ending could 've been better . However it is worth the idea presented - although a little unconventional . - Think beyond the movie - see the message - is it not relevant in the current times ? - The scenes of violence or bad behavior against Klaatu or Gort are symbolic of our natural reactions that 've led us to a world that is fighting with each other . - At least it has been very inteeligent to reflect our limitations of expecting an alien in a form that we expect - as Keanu asnwers when asked that he was in a form different than human , and had taken it up for the sake of humans - to communicate . - It does depict the aliens from a race that is more evolved based on peace , and technology . After II WW , we are always fearing that there could be a WW III based on the way the international reations are - this movie is really appropriate at such times , questioning are we really evolving ? This movie deserves awards and wins in film festivals for the idea presented . Probably it is a wake up call ! Do we really need aliens to tell us all that - may be the movie should be enough for that . " ,9
" Surpringly good . Remake\/rethink of the classic scifi film from the early 1950 's . The plot has Klaatu coming to earth to warn mankind to knock things off or else the aliens will take measures to knock it off for us . The original had Klaatu coming to earth in a space ship with a eight foot tall robot named Gort . Here he comes on a sphere with a 30 foot tall robot later called Gort . In both the effort to talk to world leaders goes awry however what follows is very different . I know this big screen version has had a good many pot shots fired at it , but I 'm kind of at a loss to wonder why . To be certain its not a big action film and perhaps that has cooled some of the response . The film is also much darker than the original with Keanu Reeve 's Klaatu deciding almost instantly to not play ball with us humans and take steps to wipe us from the planet so that the planet can survive . I know that Reeves performance is rather cold , but while I 'm not a fan and find many of his performances equally frosty , I think it works here . I know other people are upset that they do n't stay completely faithful to the original , but at the same time how could they be faithful to such a creaky -LRB- but good -RRB- film and not be roasted ? I think most people were looking to hate its it because of what its not . I went in skeptical about liking it . The reviews were mixed at best so I did n't know what to think . Only the word of a good friend gave me hope that the film might actually be something special . Personally I liked this film a great deal . -LRB- I think it might go on my surprises list at years end -RRB- . To me its an intelligent reinvention of the classic tale of the alien coming to warn us of the danger we 're in . The early scenes of Jennifer Connelly being pulled from home for an unknown reason - the approach of Klaatu 's ship are rather scary . Yes we know whats coming because we 've seen the earlier film , but the people in the film have n't and its clear they are frightened and very human . I like the bleakness . I like how Klaatu is for the most part certain we ca n't and should n't be saved . Then again he 's wonderfully full of contradiction as Connelly comments after he revives a cop he 's killed before he 's planning n destroying all of mankind . I love the new Gort who does n't shamble but moves like the kid ass cop he is . -LRB- I also love the lack of explanation of him and for much of the alien technology-hey there is n't time to explain it so they do n't -RRB- . Gort is one bad dude and you shake your head as the military keeps trying to take him out with disastrous results . I love the small performances . John Cleese is wonderful in the very serious scientist that Klaatu meets to discuss the impending doom.He needs to do more serious roles . Equally great is James Hong has Wu another alien who has been living for years on earth , He was the one who raised the alarm of man 's need to be destroyed , but who has mellowed and managed to come to love us and our contradictions . This is a very good solid -LRB- but not perfect -RRB- film . that is much better than its recent reviews and relatively low IMDb score would lead you to think it is . For me its so nice to have a remake that actually makes me feel like there was a reason to make it other than money . See this at some point . " ,8
" Great . What cinema is made for ... . I watched this film on Wednesday at the advance screening at to be honest i was expecting a lot after watching the trailers . I was not let down at all ! I have not seen the original so am looking at this as a totally new film and was very impressed . The first hour is great starts very quickly and moves along very smoothly , Reeves is the perfect person for the role he plays a strange , emotionless alien who is here to `` save the earth '' . The action is well shot and the music follows suit to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout . The one thing that made the film stand out was the story . Its original and in a very strange way believable which is what makes the film so good . Ignore reviews of this film from sad people who curse re makes this is a film that is perfect for a remake with the state of the art CGI with that big budget Hollywood feel . Its a great film and should be seen as a new film not just a remake , Just go and enjoy a night at the cinema . And see for yourself " ,9
" How can studios get away with realizing such rubbish . . Please do n't go an d waste your time by going and watching this film . The script is dumb , bland , slow and awfully written . The cinematography is underwhelming , with a lot of green screen . The acting in the film is dreadful , Keanu Reeves is completely miscast in the film , he has no gravitas and looks completely out of place in the film . Jennifer Connerly is annoying and Jaden Smith puts in one of the most annoying performances for a I have seen in a long time . The The performances are not helped by the terrible dialogue and clunky direction . The special effects and visual effects are passable but not really good . I ca n't think of anything good to say about the film , it was just a dull and woeful experience . " ,3
" Waste of time and money . what a waste of time and money . i should have spent this money on either partying or doing some other useful stuff . to begin with i had high hopes from this film considering the fact that it is a remake of 1951 classic film with the same name . the original 1951 make was classic in every way : the content , the screenplay , the direction , the dialogs , the meaning etc even though it was low on graphics . this 2008 remake , to begin with started off well but from after say about 5 minutes the movie loses its track . throughout this movie keanu reeves is trying to imply that the earth is on the verge of self destruction because of `` MANKIND ITSELF '' . what the heck ? what does he mean by it . at least the writer could have thrown some light on this . how is mankind destroying earth which is their only inhabitable planet . he could have told the reasons of this end of the world theory . till the end i could n't understand . keanu reeves keeps saying one thing `` the people living here are destroying the planet '' . from what and using what and how ? he tells that he needs to recycle earth from human beings . somebody ask him who does he represent and on whose orders he is doing it . he keeps on bragging that he needs to talk to the leader of the world . and guess what who is the leader of our world `` A NOBLE PRIZE WINNER WHO IS A MATHS PROFESSOR WHOSE EQUATION MISTAKES ARE CORRECTED BY REEVES '' . there is no peace talks , nothing . in one part the boy calls the cops to get reeves arrested.obviously the boy must have told the location to the authorities . while running from reeves the boy is about to fall off the bridge and is saved by reeves . the boy then tells him `` HELP ME OUT OF HERE AS I Do n't KNOW THIS LOCATION '' . what the heck . then how come the boy called the cops to that location . there are many loop holes , no wait , indefinite loop holes in the movie . the movie dragged on its face from start to end . no movie content , unimpressive dialogs , poor screenplay , poor direction . a mockery of original classic -LRB- a parody to be precise -RRB- . it is awful . watch at your own risk and if you like wasting time and money . i was very very disappointed . 1\/10 for graphics only .

" Liberal agenda . Nuff said . I 'm tired of the dummies in Hollywood trying to `` teach '' me how THEY want me to live . The Follyhood `` trend '' is to suck you in with what could well be an `` entertaining '' plot or preview and then USE that entertainment to send you a message about how BAD you -LRB- or humans , or America is . Is n't there a `` Follyhood '' producer still left out there that can simply make an entertaining movie without proving that he 's an idiot to the few intelligent people watching his movie ? Michael Moore proved that an idiot with money can influence other idiots that are prone to believe anything in a movie , even if it is a composite of lies , distortions , and twisted thinking . I 'm am absolutely SICK of the `` mainstream media '' and the dolts in Follyhood ! You are being lied to about a number of things ... `` Human caused '' Global shwarming , the economy , WMD in Iraq -LRB- There WERE WMD found there ; it just was n't reported by the mainstream -LRB- socialist -RRB- media . You may think that I am the `` nut '' . The fact is that I wish I was . I wish that I was telling you the lies . Do NOT trust what you hear on the news and , by all means , NEVER trust what Follyhood will try to `` teach '' you . " ,1
" What a disappointment ! . I 'm the biggest fan of Reeves and Connelly , but I can tell you now , this movie will demote not promote their ranking -LRB- for the lack of a better word -RRB- . Having attended the preview at IMAX cinema where it should be the utmost experience , well . . I 'm utterly disappointed by the movie , and I ca n't stop thinking to my self `` This movie must have been filmed in 5 days '' , there 's absolutely no events in this movie to watch , if you watch Godzilla , The Day After Tomorrow , or Deep Impact , you are likely to watch a lot more devastations , destructions , events and moments ... , I mean let 's face it , this is what you 're waiting for to see in movies like these , but in this movie even switching between locations and shifting the events from one location to another lacked was meaningless . Finally the effects , CG , and tricks were so naive . Again , ... disappointing ! " ,1
" Do not bother with this ... . Just got back from an advanced screening of this movie , and I have to say I am very disappointed . I have never seen the original -LRB- Sad , I know -RRB- but I was expecting so much from this movie , and so was my wife . The movie lacks characters in the sense there is more life in a plank of wood , than these characters . The story is slow moving and leaves the audience thinking `` What was the point of the movie ? '' . I wish I could spend more time writing these comments , but I would rather forget about this movie sooner rather than later . We left this movie believing the ONLY reason this was remade , was to cash in on the whole `` Eco Warrior '' way the world is going . " ,3
" You wo n't believe how bad it was !!!! . I just came back from the opening screening here in Selangor-Malaysia ! And i was shocked of how much this movie sucked ! my wife started laughing hard when it ended , and i was completely silent because i had nothing to say . i did n't read the book , i did n't see the first movie , and I 'm very positive that i do n't want to . honestly now , i think the production designers did a great job , but the director should go and hang himself , and never ruin a movie ever again . i mean there 's a point when you realize that this is just ridiculous , even for Keanu Reeves , where was his brain ??!! Go watch `` sleepless in Seattle '' , and pass on this rubbish ! 2 out of 10 -LRB- for the sake of the special effects -RRB- . " ,2
" Its a train wreck . If you are a fan of the 1951 classic film which I am , you certainly wont like this 2008 version , thats for sure . 1 . First big mistake director Scott Derickson -LRB- he 's only made 3 films in his entire life -RRB- did n't use the Bernard Herrmann music . Whats so great about the original film is the score by Bernard Herrmann , composer of Citizen Kane , Vertigo , Psycho , North by Northwest , Marnie , Taxi Driver . When Gus Van Sant remade Psycho he used Herrmann 's music , when Martin Scorsesse remade Cape Fear he kept Herrmanns music . Herrmann 's music is ominous , rising and falling patterns for low brass to evoke a sense of doom laden , eerie menace , strangeness , hypnotic repetition , not of this world , very unsettling . The music for the 2008 version is entirely forgettable . 2 . Second mistake , they did n't set it in Washington like the 1951 original , you need to have a backdrop of the Capitol building , the Lincoln Memorial , the Jefferson Memorial . Alfred Hitchcock always sets his films with impressive backdrops . 39 Steps Forth Rail Bridge , Vertigo Golden Gate Bridge , North by Northwest Mount Rushmore . They set it in New York but made the film in Vancouver , and Vancouver is no New York . 3 . Third mistake is the script , the Director Scott Derickson is probably a 25 year old lefty liberal slacker who wants to shove his own lefty liberal political correct message down our throats in the process he wrecks the film . Scott Derrikson said he did n't want the alien saying to the world '' if you do n't shape up , Gort will destroy the human race '' like in the original because Derrickson thought that was fascist . So Scott Derrikson wants to turn the robot into a social worker . EH ? Thats the whole point of the film , without that it does n't have the menace of Gorts death ray which might punish the disobedient human race . . Then you have little insects destroying The Eiffel Tower and other world monuments . Thats not scary , thats just stupid . Who was the dopey script writer who thought that one up ? Political correctness wrecks the movie The female star has a half cast kid who looks like a little Bob Marley -LRB- he 's a brat -RRB- So the woman went out with a black soldier but he died , This is totally irrelevant to the story , Its like a little multicultural sermon and we are being preached to , this of course slows up the pace of the movie . Kathy Bates is the Secretary of Defense , that does n't work , thats a mans role . The President of the United States is no where to be seen , I suppose he 's busy washing his hair . At the beginning of the movie there is a scene where all the scientists of the world are discussing the alien , the camera cuts to a 60 year old black woman and an Arab saying '' what are we going to tell the people , are we going to clear the streets . '' The scene does n't work because its false , if you want a scientist it has to be a German . Thems the facts . Another example of bad dialogue , two jets set out to destroy Gort , the mission fails , the American General says '' What am I going to do now . '' Nowadays , people think if you throw a lot of money and special effects at something , it will make a great movie , this is not the case . A good script and a good director makes a good movie . The 2008 version had neither . The 1951 classic was perfectly cast with Michael Rennie as the alien , Patricia Neal and Hugh Marlowe who played the greedy uptight square who wanted the diamonds . Directed by Robert Wise . In the Harry Bates short story Farewell to the Master 1940 . Klaatu is the servant and the robot is the master . For the 1951 movie it was changed plus the writer made Klaatu a more Christ like figure . " ,4
" Why , Why , Why ? . They took a classic-and raped it.Totally unnecessary remake of one of the greatest science fiction films ever made . You know the story.Alien comes to earth to warn us that we are destroying our planet-and the rest of the solar system . After he is wounded , he escapes and blends into the population . Reeves plays Klaatu as an unemotional , feelingless soul , like a Mr. Spock . Jennifer Conneley-a fine actress is totally wasted in the Patricia Neal role . She is given nothing to do , and it shows.This time around , the saucer lands in NY 's Central park.As in the original , the visitor befriends her son , but this time out the kid is just an obnoxious brat.Also on hand is Gort the robot . Looking more like a kid 's toy than a robot who can destroy the world , he shows absolutely no sense of menace . And since Klaatu must prove his powers , he does just what Michael Rennie did back in 1951 , but , of course , it is only CGI effects . The damn shame of this remake is that it gives nothing new . It only updates the story -LCB- and FX -RCB- to the current time . It is trite , predictable , pretentious , yet for some reason it moves pretty well . Hollywood and film-making are in serious trouble when a genuine classic is remade . It will probably pass muster with Generation Y , but those of us who hold the original version sacred will cringe in our seats.The kind of film that gives `` remake '' a bad name . Avoid it like the plague.Zero stars " ,1
" Gripping Thriller with a strong message . I Highly recommend seeing this film . I agree with many of the reviews that dialogue could have been better , but overall this is a great remake . The core ideas of the original have been beautifully souped-up with amazing effects and powerful references to current political and environmental issues . The film will make you think deeply , not only throughout the jaw-dropping scenes of this thriller , but for days later . While many have given this movie negative reviews , the movie will not leave you indifferent . Its use of subtle imagery and it 's strong and timely message resonates . This is your best bet if you are looking to be dazzled with amazing effects combined with a thought-provoking , and timely content . " ,10
" A total disgrace . . There is absolutely no reason why this movie should have even been made . The original `` Day The Earth Stood Still '' stands as one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made , and this thing is taking the legacy created by that cinematic masterpiece and smashing it into the ground . Casting the human-shaped plank of wood named Keanu is just adding insult to injury ; the man has absolutely no talents and should n't be allowed to PRINT scripts , let alone read them . This movie is just the latest in a long series of proof that Hollywood is creatively morally bankrupt . I encourage you - do not see or support this film in any way . " ,1
" Utter crap . Wow how do I start on this piece of donkey poop . Seriously folks , do n't waste any of your hard earned money to watch this film , especially during this recession . I suspect the producer 's brain was on recession too . How can we otherwise explain this mind-shattering idiocy . Oh sure it start out great for about 30 minutes . The rest though , is worse than any Jennifer Lopez movie . It 's a pity too since it has great premise . The storyline is too weak and the ending is even weaker . In the end , when the credit rolls , anyone associated with this movie should be ashamed , well maybe not the visual effect guy cause he did a pretty good job . But for the rest of em , holy crap , this is uwe boll territory right here . " ,1
" More proof Keanu Reeves is without any acting ability . The card board acting style of Keanu Reeves once again contributes to a dull , flacid , unmoving , uninteresting character . Kenau bores the viewer and is part of a thoroughly dull , poorly written remake . Keanu is idiomatic to the completely lifeless style of movie Hollywood has declined to . If it is not screaming characters , roaring auto chase scenes , another world disaster , race baiting nonsense or worthless remakes , Hollywood has nothing to offer the public . This The Day the Earth Stood Still movie is yet another Hollywood bomb that relies on CGI and fails to provide anyone or anything to care about . The golden age of Hollywood has past . Hollywood has lost the ability to make character driven movies . Hollywood fails to respect the emotional intelligence of the public and instead produces worthless garbage no one cares about . Keep it up Hollywood , you will be soon replaced and all the regressive democrat party socialists will be out of work . " ,1
" SPOILERS AWWW Yuck , it was horrible !!! SPOILERS . Chalk this one up to yet another Classic remade into horse pucky !! . The original was SO much better . It was plausible for it 's time . . And the idea that Klaatu has ` saved ' anyone from a horrible death at the end ... HAH !!! Sitting in your apartment neat Central Park and being eaten alive by metal nanobots , does n't seem like a good way to die . And if you are dead , you are n't ` saved ' . The premise that Klaatu is helping mankind is as little skewed . If he turns off all the machinery , or nullifies electricity or burned out all the electrical circuitry , which seems the best bet , How many people will starve ? . How many people will be killed in wars for food ? How many people will be killed in wars for the possibility of a better life ? But wait , he did n't care about the people , he was trying to save the plants and animals . How many of THEM would be killed in wars ? It does n't matter , Hollywood 's REAL message is scarier than Klaatu 's . We 're from Hollywood , we 're socialists leftists green planet lovers , and we have NO problem killing millions , or even billions of people to have our socialist \/ green utopia !! Follow us or starve and die ! " ,1
" Screenplay by Al Gore , Carl Sagan . . Yes , everything about this movie is so P.C. it 's sickening . 1 . Unlike Star Trek , these aliens have no prime directive . 2 . The military always shoots first . If you personally know anyone in the military I 'm sure you were offended . 3 . Politicians are only concerned about the party line , and know what 's best for everybody . Despite those shown by the press , MOST politicians generally have well meaning in their hearts . 4 . The religious immediately panic and the landing of this ship in central park makes everyone not an atheist cry to god to stop the apocalypse . 5 . Every mother lets their child call them helen . No wonder the kids in these movies are such brats . We know that 's not the case . Now that I 've gotten that off my chest lets at lease extol the good points . The acting is fine . If you take away the soundtrack and the special effects you see how weak the screenplay is . Bravo to the actors ! Special effects were quite good , but GORT was so obviously CGI I expected him to turn into the Silver Surfer . Who in the cinematography dept chose to paste a drab pallor on the whole film . Anyway , if you 're a movie buff like me go ahead and see it . As for me , Klaatu , Verata , Nicto " ,2
" The Day That Time Stood Still . I can accept good re-imagined remakes . The new Star Trek movie is an excellent example of this . But this movie was un-imaged . As stated by others the special effect were n't . I was confused by which one was the robot and which was Keunu Reeves because the acting was identical . The movie had long periods where the characters watched the blue screen waiting for something to happen , but unfortunately so did the audience and it never did . And then to wrap it all up with an ending that was completely unrealistic and unbelievable . On the plus side Jennifer Connelly was okay in her role and the actor playing her stepson did n't spike himself . I was n't disappointed that it was a poor remake - it is simply a poor movie . " ,4
" Truly Truly Awful . I kept myself from watching this for so long . Now I am preparing to blank my mind with a litre of vodka ! I am a fan of the original and this does not deserve the same title . If this movie had not attempted to piggy back on a classic movie , I would just have hated the story , but watched it for the visuals . As it was , I despised even the visuals purely out of spite . Why oh why was Will Smiths ' kid in the abomination ? He helped suck the life out of this already lacklustre story . If you have not watched this movie , then DO . Yes I recommend you DO WATCH this ! Just to remind yourself why it is so many people pirate the -LRB- in general -RRB- pap that spews from the movie business . " ,1
" I Think He Killed Most Of Us Anyway . Did anyone else spend the entire movie wanting to put a bullet through that willful , spoiled , thoughtless , disobedient , self-centered little kid 's temple ? I could barely watch the rest of this piece of crap for spending most of my time grinding my teeth at him . Okay , there were one or two interesting visuals , but what about the ending ? Exactly how long is industrial society going to be shut off ? -LRB- And I 'm not sure how you do that without changing the laws of physics . -RRB- If the shutdown is permanent , most of us are dead anyway . The Earth ca n't support 6 billion plus people on pre-industrial tech . We 'd probably be down to a billion or so in the undeveloped parts of the world where people are already living tech-free within five years . Thanks but no thanks there , Klaatu . Remind me not to ask you for any more favors . " ,3
" What a strange flick ! . This movie could have been great . . but lost its way at about 20 minutes into the film . As soon as I saw Kathy Bates cast as a hawkish Defense Sec . - I knew we were in trouble - then the kid . . The character really adds no value to the story except for maybe giving Klaatu one more reason to take out humanity . And poor -LRB- cartoonish CGI -RRB- Gort - seemed to be an after thought . All in all - this movie needed to be reined in - they tried too hard to be PC and missed out on being a good movie . Whats odd . . as much as this movie annoys me to the core of my being - I ca n't seem to stop watching it on cable . . kind of like seeing a bad accident on the side of the road . The original 1951 did n't need a remake - especially to push an agenda . " ,3
" Avoid it . . Oh boy , where to begin on this one ... I wo n't go into the plot or story , because it 's non-existent . It 's a 100 train wreck that sometimes tries to be a sci-fi film , but attempts to insert some action and CGI money shots . It fails miserably , being a Michael-Bay-esquire version of what a sch fi movie is supposed to be . Keanu 's acting speaks for himself , he is pretty much playing the same character as he did over the past 15 years -LRB- post-Speed Keanu -RRB- . Kathy Bates is wasted on this one , and she FEELS she 's on the wrong place , you can see it right through her acting . John Cleese appears on the cameo that shows how DEAD his career is . From Python to this , it 's so SAD to witness his scenes ... Of course , we have Jaden Smith , at yet another ANNOYING scenery chewing piece of child performance , that makes you roll your eyes in disbelief . You can just FEEL his dad right next to the camera , paying off the director to keep him in this film . Filled with plot holes and an anti-climatic Deus Ex Machina , the classic 1951 film is murdered on this 2008 travesty , a sign of how awful Hollywood has turned . I can not stress this too much : avoid . " ,2
" WTF was that ? . to say this movie was disappointing is a huge understatement.it 's allegedly a science fiction film , but it i really is n't . it 's a actually a drama with a lot of talking and not much else.people talk a lot and nothing much happens.there is a fair bit of suspense , but it builds and builds and ... nothing.there 's nothing wrong with a good drama , if that 's what you 're expecting.even so , this is n't really a good drama , but any stretch.it is however , tedious to the nth degree.it 's also one big clich after another.apparently one of the editions of the DVD has an alternate ending.i have n't seen that.but i have a great idea for an alternate beginning : the invaders appear right away , and wipe every human being who would otherwise have to sit through this thing , off the map.at least those who hated it.what a dog 3\/10 " ,3
" DVD edition is probably the worst ever . My comment is mostly related to the DVD edition . No Extras worth mentioning ; the only special was a commented version of the film but no making of , trailer or interviews with actors or directors . I would have expected a minimum of 30 minutes of extra material . As it looks Fox wants to move viewers to BluRay instead of DVD . The film is nice but the lack of any additional material was a real letdown . Performance by Keanu Reeves was good although the story was a bit confusing . I especially did not appreciate the concept of the moving cloud of artificial insects . During the cloud situation the logic behind how long does it take to grow through a pane of glass vs. the time of destroying a complete football stadium is completely off . Overall a quite disappointing experience . " ,2
" The Day My Brain Stood Still . My wife wanted to watch it because John Hamm is in it , and between Mad Men and 30 Rock he 's the new heartthrob :-RRB- Unfortunately , it featured two of the worst , phoned in performances by John Hamm and Kathy Bates I 've ever seen - and easily one of the worst scripts . Some of the F\/X looked pretty good , especially Gort , but that 's about all it had going for it . Truly awful . Just a bunch of special effects scenes strung together by what I guess passes for a script these days . Random , disjointed nonsense and stiffest , lifeless dialogue you 're likely to see -LRB- and I 'm not talking about Keanu -RRB- . I gave it a 2 , and that was being generous . " ,2
" Bland , Boring and over the top . . I thought this movie was terrible , especially after all the hype . The story is there , the actors are there but as with so many movies these days , there is something crucial missing . The only good thing about this movie is the accuracy in it 's portrayal of a senseless American government which I found quite amusing in it 's accuracy . It was nice to see Keanu Reeves in a role similar to that of the Matrix movies but everything else was a let-down . I 'd have to agree with the other reviews of this movie . There is absolutely nothing there to make me want to watch it again , so do yourself a favor and avoid it . " ,1
" 1\/10 is generous . I loved the original version of The Day The Earth Stood Still and I still enjoy watching in today even in all of its black and white glory . Unlike these fake black and white movies of today its a film with some substance and not all style . Well the remake has neither . I do n't bother blaming actors anymore for bad movies , I blame writers who seem to have little imagination and no concerns for logic at all . Somethings you can get by with but other things are just plain illogical . Such is the case for this movie . I would give specific examples but I pride myself in submitting comments without spoilers . Needless to say this was a painful film to sit through and I rented it on DVD . And of course by the end , and I could have skipped it but I just was curious to see how it came out , though I already knew , I just wanted it to be over . Shame on them , shame on the writers .

" Boring , inconsistent , and ultimately forgettable . An alien spacecraft lands in Central Park , and an alien emerges . After being wounded in an attack by the U.S. military , the human-like Klaatu -LRB- Keanu Reeves -RRB- appears when being nursed back to health and hints at the potential destruction of Earth . He manages to escape government officers , and ends up in the care of scientist Helen Benson -LRB- Jennifer Connelly -RRB- . Along with her adopted son Jacob -LRB- Jaden Smith -RRB- , the group attempts to try and stop the impending destruction , while the government chases after them . Buried very deep into the core of The Day the Earth Stood Still is some semblance of a great movie . But its outer shell is anything but . The plot may sound interesting , but after Klaatu makes it clear what his purpose is , the movie becomes a downgraded half-assed chase movie that is more boring than it is thrilling . And by the time the ending comes around , the film and everything about it is utterly forgettable . Humanity appears to be at stake , but none of the characters seem to really care about their survival . It just seems so standard to them , so tactic . Characters are done away with like they are nothing -LRB- whether by dying or just not appearing again -RRB- , and other characters appear with not even the slightest hint of motivation . How are we supposed to leach on to anyone when no one is even remotely likable ? The closest we get to a three-dimensional character is Reeves ' Klaatu , and he speaks in such riddles and convoluted language that he may as well not be speaking English . Do not get me wrong : The Day the Earth Stood Still is loaded with a goldmine of ideas . But they are all treated as mere inconveniences to the bigger plot the film struggles with . The filmmakers seem to have very little idea of what they want to do with the picture . It seems to want to send a message , but it does not know how to . It jumps from idea to idea -LRB- and even though to thought -RRB- , hoping to grip onto something that sticks . But nothing does . It is merely written over , waiting for the next idea to spark and be done away with . Even the special effect showpieces are carelessly done . Sure , there are some great effects , but ultimately , there is nothing too spectacular on display here . It is not clear where the fault for this silly and ultimately unneeded film lies . Do we blame screenwriter David Scarpa for not knowing whether he should homage the original work , steal from multiple films that have come since , or create his own original idea ? Or do we look to director Scott Derrickson and the creative team for having culled together the shots and sequences for the film , and then not knowing how to make some sort of good movie out of it ? If they do not care , then why should we ? The acting is poor across the board . Connelly , an Oscar-winner , should have known better than to touch this film . She looks stunted and confused in every one of her scenes . I imagine she tried to make something of this awful role , but you would never even guess with the footage that exists in the film . Smith , while playing to his age , seems to be aping his father a little too much . He wants to be spunky , but he wants to try to act method at the same time . With a little more work , he could probably match Will 's best work from the mid-1990s , but if he keeps this up , he is destined to become a laughing stock that will annoy audiences . Jon Hamm and Kyle Chandler are given such a small amount of work to do that one must wonder why the filmmakers went with recognizable faces in their roles , while John Cleese and James Hong have such short scenes that you may blink and miss them altogether . Kathy Bates genuinely tries to make something of her juicy role , but it is downplayed far too much . Reeves however , delivers another classic Reeves performance . This role was practically tailored for him to play . He spends most of his time on-screen giving baffled and bizarre looks at the camera , or delivering the stilted dialogue we have come to know him for . He gets no real time to emote in the role , and gets even less time to explain himself . But Reeves is a master of this stoned out technique , and is on his own playing field against the rest of the cast . He has done far greater work -LRB- The Matrix trilogy obviously , and my personal guilty pleasure , Speed -RRB- , but because this role does not ask much of him by way of actual emotion , he soars through as the single best thing about the movie . And yes , I am quite terrified alluding to that idea . Calling The Day the Earth Stood Still disappointing is a bit of a stretch . Calling it awful is a lot better of a description . While the plot sounds like it could make for some interesting science-fiction -LRB- especially based off its legendary source material -RRB- , the film falters and fails too many times to really make anything of itself . There are some great ideas sprinkled throughout the movie , but nothing is ever done with them . They are either brushed away , or outright ignored . Whether it is the boring storyline , the bad acting , the horrendous dialogue , the erratic tonal shifts , or the very inconsistent CGI , the film just has no chance to even attempt to work . And as a movie with a message , it fizzles more often than it sizzles . It has the ideas to go the distance , but lacks the motivation . 3\/10 . -LRB- Portions of this review originally appeared on http:\/\/www.dvdfanatic.com -RRB- . " ,3
" Utter Drivel . Possibly the worst movie I have seen this century . No , that is not fair to all the other movies ... This is absolutely the worst movie this century . All the other condemning reviews sum it up except that I would like to add ... The original 1951 movie was based on Farewell to the Master , a short story by Harry Bates , and while the 1951 movie deviates from the path of the story , it must be said that this movie ` fell ' off the path , rolled down a ravine and crashed into volcano . If this movie was called anything other than ` Day The Earth Stood Still ' , there is not a person in the world who would make the link back to Farewell to the Master -LRB- and Harry would be happy about that -RRB- . It is nothing more than a self indulgence by the creators . If you really need to find a way to spend two hours . Read the original short story . " ,1
" Worst movie of the decade ! . I can honestly say that i have seen movies shot with a mobile phone that have more quality and logic in the script , better plot and a better end . This movie is a big commercial -LRB- for a certain toxic food chain -RRB- and exactly NOTHING more ! It starts of good , but the stupidity , lack of logic and intelligence picks up right on ! And the end ! OMG ! It must have the worst and most stupid ending i have ever seen in a Hollywood flick . \* SPOILER \* the irritating kid changes the all knowing wise `` aliens '' view on people ? The all powerful being runs from the military ? The first thing he eats is junk food from the main junk source ? Do not see this , you wo n't miss a thing ! " ,1
" The Day the creativity dies . I ca n't explain how disappointed i was after watching this `` thing '' . Keanu Reeves -LRB- one of the best actors in present , and nearly always acting in great movies -RRB- . And the great story , who was filmed so awesome in the fifty 's . But what was that at least ? I must had know , that this ca n't be a good movie from the director , who makes a horror classic like `` Hellraiser '' to a joke . He really missed every moment to make a good movie . No association with the characters . How bad the scene was as Klaatu decides to rescue the humankind ... I feel nothing ! And that 's because of this `` 16-year-old-talking-and-behavior '' child . Why ? He showed us in `` The Pursuit of Happiness '' that you can feel with him . And this `` invasion '' ... awful ! The whole meaning gets lost ... He could have been showing such impressive pictures of our planet to get a feeling for the complex of problems , who are so real in our days . But nothing ! The spheres landing in the jungle , you only see it coming down to the ground ... and that 's it . The only animals you see are little snakes , frogs and other little creatures . No lion , no elephant , no animal you get impressed for , but that could have been so important to get a feeling for the movie . But maybe exactly this points who makes me sick are the special interpretation of Mr. Scott Derrickson . I unusual seen such a unmotivated and boring movie ... " ,3
" Maybe in 1951 , but in 2008 the world keeps spinning . I was hoping for a nicely entertaining movie , but it was not to be so . Its a rather slowpaced story , and with War Of the Worlds in my mind I never felt the visual satisfaction as I did with that movie . The visuals just do n't make up for the lack of story-depth . I kept waiting for it but nothing came . In the end the story was just too dubious to be entertaining . ------ spoiler below ------ OK , the earth is going to be cleansed of humans by an alien society that sends a single guy to earth -LRB- and of course Manhattan ... -RRB- to see if we are treating our planet right . In the process he meets an old Chinese guy who is actually an alien that has been living here for a while who said we cant be saved and have to be destroyed -LRB- but he loves us ! . . -RRB- . So OK he decides to kill all living things on earth , except for some samples of species -LRB- Noa 's arks : they evidently do n't understand the basics of genomes and the necessity of a broad genepool -RRB- so the earth can start over . But no , he is convinced by a totally non-convincing woman with an hysterical child not to complete his plans . And he comes from a group of alien civilizations beyond our comprehension ? And why do they really care for our earth , and why really cant technology help us ? There is just so much inconsistency in the whole of the story that maybe an audience in 1951 would have swallowed , but today this just wont do . " ,4
" Another Hollywood Hogwash Remake . Am I the only one sick and tired of politically correct propaganda movies that exploit classic films to get an audience ? I would never had wasted time watching this movie if I had known that the screenplay was ghostwritten by Al Gore . The original film starring Michael Rennie was made during the Cold War when we were all frightened of nuclear proliferation . At least that was a real fear . This horrific remake has alien civilizations ready to destroy all humans because we are destroying the planet . The only way we 'll be destroyed is if we go back to being cave dwellers . Electricity is bad people . Even electric cars are a no-no . Yeah right ! What arrogance to think that the human race can destroy a planet billions of years old because a lamebrain non scientist like Al Bore said the planet is heating up . Listen folks , he made a fortune selling carbon credits to morons . Hollywood is full of hypocritical morons who ride around in Helicopters and jets but we 're supposed to save energy.I just wish they 'd stop making bad movies like this . " ,1
" was not impressed . The movie was sad . Not the ending just the effort by all involved . The theme seemed to be very simple . All humans bad But American humans are the worst of all . In the original we feared the unknown and responded mostly out of fear . In this one the only good alien is a dead alien . Most of the cast did not seem to believe the lines they were saying . Almost every one in the movie seemed to be disinterested . It was like they had about 6 different ideas about the feel in the movie and all the action was in different directions . If we are the worst that the universe has to offer and we are destructive and aggressive what does it say about a superior level of being that believes that their method of fixing the problem is total destruction of complex lifeforms and starting the planet over as a desert . It seemed to me that they were much more violent and cruel than us . You would think they would at least put us down humanly instead of robot bugs devouring . As I said a sad effort on all parts " ,1
" What the frack !!!! . This movie has shown me one lesson . Never no matter how much you have a faith in a movie , I repeat never buy a DVD without watching the movie first !!! This sorry piece of cinema does n't even deserve the title of its classic predecessor . Do n't get me started on the kid !! I tried to make myself like this movie I really did . I said OK I can get past the kid . Then I said OK I can get past the fact that the professor is now a bit part . Why did John Cleese even bother ? Finally I started to get suckered in by its whole earth day hippie message . OK I can go with this . Last five minutes of the movie I am with it suddenly what the Frak ? It 's over with no closure , what a piece of crap !!! " ,3
" Wrong on so many levels . This movie for me was beyond awful . Last time i saw a movie that annoyed me off as much as this one , was ... i do n't know when . Just an awful movie , probably directors thought special effects only will do the job . Do n't know really where to start . OK first of all , at the beginning when they gather everyone from all walks of life in what science means , why ? They thought it was a celestial body or some sort -LRB- the micro black hole comment by a `` scientist '' was a killer , since they could n't detect a black hole to the means they were tracking it , let alone see it on Radar , since the black hole would just absorb all the radar waves , or if that was n't a radar was just a computer approximation of the target 's projected trajectory , no way would telescopes could discover a 100 meters wide sphere from hundreds of millions of miles away -RRB- but they had this protocol , like an alien life biologist could help them in any way -LRB- any life carried by the celestial body would be destroyed on impact -RRB- , as with the others.And those spheres , why were they moving with 30000 km\/s ? An advanced civilization as i presume they are , should have the technology to move much faster , unless they bothered to travel for 10000 years at least at a small cosmological speed , just to tell us they want to exterminate us.And they detected one sphere , but failed to detect the hundred other spheres that were heading thowards Earth ? Then they ca n't launch their missles ,1 minute and something seconds , before the celestial body hit earth.They would n't even gotten out of the Earth 's atmosphere before impact , let alone deflect the body.Also just before impact , why was the helicopter filled with `` the greatest minds '' on earth hovering over Manhatten , the place where the impact should occure ?! When the alien lands , someone shoots it ... Pardon my french , but who the flux shoots an alien in an encounter . Maybe some crazy drunk fool , but no way do soldiers following orders would shoot it . Did they have any ideas about its intentions ? Why do any hostile movements ? Yelling medic after someone shoots an alien its priceless also.Also , when the horrible played `` secratary of state '' mentions that when advanced civilizations meet less advanced ones , usually the result is enslaving or exterminating the less advanced one . Well did she\/they really thought that by showing hostility towards the aliens\/robot would help their cause ? Also same things apply to all other people , as Will Smith 's kid , saying about fighting ... They did n't show hostility ?! Why would you want to start a war with a much more advanced civilization ????! The Robot looks humanoid . Why ? They made it so we would n't feel threatened by a robot that only activates when subjected to violence ?! The aliens were n't humanoids in looking , from what the alien said . The Sphere lands in Manhattan ... Why ? Did n't the alien want to speak with the leader of humanity -LRB- not to mention they have been following earth , they should have known we have n't got a leader -RRB- , did he expect to find him in Central Park ? Why not the White House ? Putting an alien thru a lie detector is such stupid ... No matter how you look at it , if someone actually did this i would kill myself in shame of being a human , as i do n't think your average Joe would take decisions when it comes to that matter . The talking in Japanese\/Chinese in the coffee shop was just stupid . Why not talk in English . An intelligent being could 've learned English in 60 + years on Earth , the average non-English speaking kid from a developed country knows English by the age of 10 ? There 's much more stuff that probably i 'm not remembering right now , and i 'm sorry , but think i covered some issues . Now to the acting.I 'm not gon na exaggerate by saying doing this film with people off the street would 've been just the same.The acting was horrible , and Keanu Reaves makes me stop going to see movies in which he is cast in . Really . I cant stress enough what poor acting performances you see in this movie . Its like you see a bad movie that comes straight to DVD . Last to not prolong this , is i would like to express one final opinion.I hate , and i repeat I hate , how movies like this see the light of day , in which producers expect to make money by sheer special effects only , no trying to show at all that cinematography it 's art.Tens of million of dollars spend on something that got me really annoyed . . What is really the point of that ? Do producers really think we are that stupid and make money with whatever they trow at us ??? Now for final words , i want to apologize for my grammatical\/spelling mistakes , English is not my primary language , plus i had a few glasses of wine . Avoid this movie if you consider yourself a thinking person , that does n't get fooled by special effects.Can ' t stress enough how producers think that special effects are just like a shiny thing that hypnotizes it.No matter how bad the movie\/acting is they expect us when we see good special effects , '' we be like oho shinny shinny thing '' . " ,1
" the day this turd made the world stood still with its awfulness . The remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is a completely pathetic movie that 's an embarrassment to anyone involved with the making of this turd . Even though I did n't expect much when I heard that they were going to do a remake I was n't expecting the film to be this bad . The script has NO logic whatsoever . It ambulates here and there , with no idea what it 's supposed to be . From the get go , the film never got a chance : when the government learns about a mysterious object heading towards earth , with a direct trajectory for New York city , they assemble a bunch of scientists and fly them to the maybe soon to be destroyed city . What kind of logic is that ? If you 're going to assemble the brightest scientists to help with how to cope with a possible impending disaster , why fly them directly in the object 's path ? Because they did n't know how the object was going to react once it entered the earth 's atmosphere , it would have made more sense for them to wait after the object landed or crashed and then go to New York city once the city was safe or its impact did n't cause any massive destruction . This happens at the beginning and it 's downhill from then on . The script is filled with an endless series of illogical plot points that 's are an insult to anyone with any intelligence . But it 's not only the script that 's bad . The acting , dialogue , special effects and action are all awful . Specific scenes like Keanu killing and reviving the police officer ; Keanu and John Cleese talking about humanity ; the nano insects -LRB- why insect-shaped ? -RRB- thingies coming from Gort ; the decision to have the military come up with the name GORT , which is an acronym for `` Genetically Organized Robotic Technology '' -LRB- I kid you not -RRB- were all jaw on the floor painfully bad to witness . This film is to be avoided at all cost . " ,1
" Horrible and Insulting . I felt compelled to write my first review , motivated by the worst film I 've ever seen . 1 -RRB- Alien -LRB- Klaatu -RRB- travels light-years to earth , can use mind to implode lie-detector , short out security systems , learn English\/Chinese instantly , but ca n't get to UN from Central Park ? 2 -RRB- Decides to spend time running around with scientist lady , lets see how PC Hollywood can be ? She 's a white single mom , w \/ dead Africa-American husband , and has a black son who calls her Helen , wow ! how cool is that ? Biological mom is dead ? So all of us colored folks have broken homes ? Please ! How about an Asian step-brother , with an Iraqi orphan , it all seems so foolish . 3 -RRB- Dialog ? Helen pleads for us ? Do n't destroy earth , we can change . 4 -RRB- At this point , my mind shut down , I puked in my popcorn , feeling sick for supporting this crap , and hope that maybe my review can save one of us from wasting their money .

" Incredibly intense . Another unfortunate film meeting we hate the director because the internet told us to preconceptions , 1968 Tunnel Rats is a complete success in what it sets out to do - create an overwhelming sense of fear and claustrophobia . There are war movies , and there are horror movies . This is both . Yet , there is no Predator creature jumping around , no crazy virus , no hallucinations , no . The war is scary enough itself . There 's no patriotic propaganda here , neither is there any political anti-war message , the movie just shows us how scary life as a soldier could be . This is the kind of fear which is felt by real people , every day . A highly recommended film if you like tension and suspense . More accessible than SEED , more mature than Alone in the Dark . " ,9
" Boll has finally done it . It is very easy to hate on anything that Uwe Boll does , and it is clear that most people here are taking this path of least resistance and jumping that same wagon . However , it takes a greater person to admit when they were wrong and give credit when it is due , and it most certainly due . If one really wanted to , they could pick apart the historical accuracy of the film , or the tactics , or the costuming , or the geography ; I am sure that such people could easily find some justification for condemning this film . On the other hand , what would follow would be a trite listing of errors and complaints , tarted up with clever comments and sealed with some witty remark . Is that what proper film critique is about ? It does n't take much in the way of intelligence to attack and destroy what you see before you . That is why people do it so easily and without thought . In a way , this film touches on that very human failing . So many film goers and critics -LRB- professional and armchair -RRB- are going to dismiss this film as if it is some plague carrier , and only because of the name that goes with it . I feel sorry for those people because they will miss out on a great many interesting and even inspiring film experiences in their life time . Tunnel Rats is one such experience . It is a small production and done very succinctly and without much extraneous posturing . From the first scene , the film gets right down to business and does n't really let up until the gripping and downright mortifying ending . Perhaps it is the small size of the production that has kept Boll honest somewhat . I can imagine that when contracted to make Hollywood films , there is a lot of pressure to appeal to the attention deficit audiences out there , often the very ones that hate him , and therefore he aims too far above his mark . In this film he hits the mark very confidently and professionally . It is worth seeing this film , and doing so without preconception or judgment . Boll is just the director and a film is a sum of its parts , even though Boll directed this film , there were dozens of earnest and hardworking actors and crew members putting in their all to make this film . It is the hight of arrogance to laugh at their efforts and belittle what they made when truly there is nothing really wrong with it . I hope that enough people are see this film so that Boll can keep doing what he enjoys and sharing it with people . Every film , when made earnestly , has something worthwhile to show us . Stay free of the popularist hate for Uwe Boll and see films for what they are . " ,4
" War is futile : a simple message brutally demonstrated . `` 1968 Tunnel Rats '' makes a brutal statement about the horrors of war and pulls no punches . Unlike many Hollywood epics which purport to teach their lessons through clever manipulations of the heart , this is no coming-of-age film or family drama couched in a setting of battle . Writer\/director Uwe Boll has created a film which is very simply about the futility of war , in this case , set in the jungles of Vietnam . North Vietnamese fighters dug tunnels , sometimes hundreds of miles long , in which they hid , lived , and carried out surprise missions against the Americans . After an ambush of several members of his squad , Sergeant Vic Hollowborn -LRB- Michael Pare -RRB- returns to the area with a ragtag group of Army soldiers to avenge their deaths . These young men , some barely out of high school , walk blindly into a world they 've never known . The ensemble cast does what they need to do -- this is not as much of a character-driven piece as other films of this genre , and the improvised dialogue is n't Hollywood war movie fluff . I 've never been in battle but I hope the soldiers in the film are realistically depicted . They certainly are n't romanticized a la `` Apocalypse Now . '' Pare 's Sergeant Hollowborn is an effective leader , a man who makes his own rules and expects his men to follow them . Other standouts include Nate Parker as Private Jim Lidford , who thinks his urban roots make him tough enough to breeze through this assignment , and Rocky Marquette as Private Terence Verano , the sweet baby-faced kid who exemplifies what made this particular war so intolerable for American mothers -- he clearly does n't belong here -LRB- not that anybody does -RRB- . Lidford ought to be back on the basketball court on the corner and Verano ought to be back on the beaches of Lake Michigan . Among the North Vietnamese `` enemies , '' watch for Jane Le as young mother Vo Mai . Her heartwrenching performance will stay with you long after the credits roll . The look is stark and the action unrelenting . The lighting is subdued -- dark and dirty , much like the jungle landscape and tunnels themselves . Opening credits are accompanied by the Zager Evans ' classic `` In the Year 2525 , '' which had me deceptively smiling from the start . Jessica de Rooij 's score turns ominous after that and was one of the highlights of the movie . But what stood out the most for me was the camera-work of Mathias Neumann . From the copious use of crane shots , as if we are hiding up in the trees ready to pounce , to the hand-held closeups in the tunnel sequences , there is no relief . Visual effects are topnotch and breathtaking . But with few exceptions , `` 1968 Tunnel Rats '' does not rely on sweeping vistas and long shots of masses of soldiers readying for battle . And it does n't need to . This is about hand-to-hand combat , literally , and the claustrophobic setting is palpable . Shot on location in South Africa , Boll put all the actors through a boot camp with actual mercenaries prior to filming . This was n't a `` Hollywood '' boot camp , referring to the usual type of training actors go through before a war movie . No , they were trained by men who literally had been out killing just a few days beforehand . Filmmakers , cast , and crew all took this project seriously and it shows . This film may be difficult to watch but it 's too compelling to turn away . There is n't a lot to laugh at , although the characters are well-developed enough that we get to know their hopes and fears . It 's also definitely a war movie in the true sense of the genre , with heavy political undertones . But It does n't try to be all things to all people . `` 1968 Tunnel Rats '' is dark and dirty and about as serious as a film can get . If writer\/director Uwe Boll is trying send a message , it comes through loud and clear . " ,8
" Worst Nam movie ever made . As a Nam vet and former combat infantry squad leader I can tell you this movie was 80 % BS . As commented on by others we do n't build permanent camps in the middle of the jungle . Camps are built in areas where clear fields of fire can be created so that daylight surprise attacks like the one depicted in the movie can not happen . There also were no jeeps riding down two tracks in the jungle , for the same obvious reason . There are so many factual errors in this flick like uni 's , incorrect armaments , a unit insignia that I 've never seen before , etc , etc , etc. . The director obviously had no knowledge of what went on in Vietnam and he did n't bother to find out by bringing in a knowledgeable technical consultant . This movie is without question the worst Vietnam era movie ever made and one of the worst war movies of all time . The shame of it is that there is a truly gripping story to be told about guys who volunteered to be tunnel rats in the Nam and this flick failed miserably to tell that story . What 's worse is from what I see on this website , far too many of you think this was some kind of representative and half way decent movie . Nothing could be further from the truth . And FYI , there were no 6 foot and 6 foot plus tunnel rats as depicted in the movie . Tunnel rats by necessity were the shortest guys who more approximated the size of the people who built and used the tunnels . " ,1
" Like the tunnels in the film , the film is an ambush on the audience in the sense Boll takes us all by surprise . . What am I supposed to say about a war film made by Uwe Boll ? I know the man by reputation alone and this is my first venture into his film-making domain . It seems he 's brought about quite an aura for horrifically bad films , and yet there I was watching Tunnel Rats and genuinely thinking it was a good effort . Am I supposed to sit here and say it 's a horrid , pointless mess of fast edits and nonsensical action running on a paper thin script complete with horrid acting ? Should that sort of summary be synonymous with a Uwe Boll war film ? Well surprise , surprise Tunnel Rats is actually a damn fine effort and it proves people are willing to jump on certain critical bandwagons just as easily as people are willing to jump on positive bandwagons . The film succeeds in the sense it captures the madness of war as well as delivering scenes of strong , bloody violence that repulses more than it does excite as these various action set-pieces and scenarios play out . Hey , this is more than what the recent Rambo film offered when all we got was a plethora of gore and disembowelment as ` justified ' warfare was played out between those poor , poor Christians and those evil , evil Burmese soldiers . The primary content and the ` tunnel rats ' of the title refers to soldiers whom engage in activity you feel you 'd have to be mad to partake in ; an activity that is not about capturing or defending terrain ; or searching out an individual al Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan , but about clearing Vietcong tunnels located beneath the battlefields . The Tunnel Rats of the title are three jeep loads of soldiers assigned to the C Chi tunnel complex , Vietnam , in 1968 . Their task is to clear out the tunnels surrounding their base camp traps , enemies and all . The platoon are made up of all sorts ; these are not just faceless characters called in to spawn some bloody violence\/action as they ` blow some stuff up real good ' for the benefit of a passive audience . Some are white , some are black ; some are younger than others ; some are innocent , naive and soft-bodied whereas some others feel the need to stamp authority within the group . Some even share certain religious beliefs that others do not subscribe to . There are some points in which you want the characters whom are down in those tunnels out and ` safe ' as soon as possible , then there are others during which you want them down there and ` safe ' as potential danger approaches on the surface . Other times , soldiers survive the ordeal of the tunnels only to emerge and face new horrors . Boll toys with the audience in this regard , using each respective ` space ' as both a safe haven and a potential death trap at various times to really good effect . The team assigned to deal with this tunnel network share some thoughts and memories from childhood the night before they ship out to begin work . We know the tunnels are a dingy and claustrophobic space on top of a dangerous locale thanks to the opening scene . Further talk of the tunnels being death traps plays out with some characters speculating the dangers through past stories and rumor as well as how the Vietcong can ` smell ' you . This makes the scenes later on when a character lights up a cigarette down there even more harrowing . The talk of the tunnels further prolongs anxiety , as the brief but memorable opening scene floats in and around our memory . The tunnels , however , remain off screen and we know what awaits the group , giving us a position of power a position of power that is further emphasised when we witness entire scenes dedicated to the Vietcong , the American 's enemy , one occurrence of which sees the camera crane directly below a Tunnel Rat to reveal a makeshift Vietcong war room . Initially , the first tunnel is a bit of a disaster . It is a dead end and while eliminating two of the enemy , they loose three guys . The sense of failure and frustration at such a cost for so little is clearly evident , very briefly creating a helpless and desperate atmosphere in the film and in our own minds about the situation . Boll captures the horror and the cramped conditions of the tunnels perfectly . Shooting in low light and keeping his camera rock steady as his subject scurries and struggles about erratically , we feel frightened when people venture into the unknown and horrified when altercation with the enemy arises . Boll even finds room to develop scenarios within the already established conventions by including the character of Vo Mai -LRB- Jane Le -RRB- as this frightened Vietnamese woman who lives within the tunnels with her two young children . The award winning Jane Le does a great job in portraying the fear and madness of it all . The final thirty minutes or so are pure , gripping , impressive war genre cinema . I did n't notice it beforehand , but there is a certain electronic pulsating sound effect\/musical number that plays on a loop during this time , which really captures the horror and the suspense you 're witnessing as people scrap for their lives it 's fascinating to watch . Whereas Michael Bay can just fetishise action and gunfire with copious amounts of explosions and slow motion towards the end of Transformers as that becomes even more empty headed ; vacuous and nonsensical than it already was , and Stallone can offer nothing bar mere break-neck action as the baddies get their comeuppance toward the conclusion of Rambo IV , Boll shows us that war is , in fact , Hell and war-zones are places you really do n't ever want to be . The two respective films have high IMDb ratings close to ' 7 ' ; Tunnel Rats has something bordering on ' 4 ' looks like that Boll-hate bandwagon is in full runaway mode , whereas the Stallone\/Bay-love bandwagon is on an equally slick streak . How sad . " ,7
" Atmospheric , brutal , intense I loved this . . Firstly I should admit that I do like the war genre but also realize that like anything else there are good ones and bad ones . This for me was a good one , a really good one . Like others have mentioned the dark lighting , claustrophobic tunnel sets , realistic looking location and uneasy score . I found myself not wanting to relax back in the chair as I felt the tension and body count build . A problem with many Hollywood war flicks like Pearl Harbour or Saving Private Ryan , is that they are just some all American good guy runs around , shoots heaps of enemy with 1 gun while tens of enemy guns have no effect , saves the day and the US and Allied forces are glorified and the enemy are demonised . At least in Rats everyone dies , and it is shown that there are all types of soldiers on both sides rather than just good Americans and bad Vietcong . As far as the technical side of things go people have to realize that when 98 % of people will find the costumes and props fine , the studio is n't going spend a bunch of extra money to satisfy the extra 2 % . My take is that you just have to give films a break if you have expertise in their area . If sickening Hollywood endings make you want to spew then this is for you . " ,8
" I saw Tunnel Rats SOME SPOILERS . I 've been writing for Ai n't It Cool News for 11 years and I found out there 's a rift between Harry Knowles and Uwe Boll that 's why Harry wo n't publish it . Regardless , its the best movies Boll has ever written and directed ; except for the ending . WARNING ! SPOILERS ! Uncapie here ! Let 's spend a `` Holiday In Cambodia '' where the people dress in black . Okay , now before everyone gets on my ass , this is the best film Uwe Boll has written and directed . Yes , I 'm serious . `` Tunnel Rats '' is a powerful , well-written story about the little known group of American soldiers in Vietnam of the same name based loosely on elements from the `` Tunnels of Cu Chi '' and real-life events that took place there . The pre-credits sequence is intense . A Tunnel Rat armed only with handgun and a flashlight searches for Viet Cong , in a tight , claustrophobic environment . Stops and listens . Nothing . We see the VC doing the same thing . They 're heading towards each other . When the confrontation happens , the audience never sees the twist coming . Boll captures the intensity these men went through in the crawl spaces . You actually feel like your trapped in these tiny confines with the soldiers . The dirt , the dust filling your lungs as you attentively search for the enemy , crawling on your belly , not being able to stand up for long periods of time , no light except for that of your flashlight and the fear of what unknown factor might lie ahead ; whether it be an enemy soldier or a deadly booby-trap . You look for a way out of a 75 mile interconnected maze that is 2-3 levels deep . Its intense . One thing I like about Boll what he did with this film is that he showed both sides of the combatants . Each side had their reason for doing what they had to do and what they believed in . Both sides had gray areas in their duties , but basically , both groups just wanted to get this war over with and go home . Michael Pare portrays the burned out , `` Lieutenant Vic Hollowborn . '' A real hard case , who at one time was probably a captain or major , but was busted down to lieutenant because he 's too stern with his men challenging them to boxing matches if they step out of line . A good tactician , they gave him a dirty job instead of a one-way ticket to the LBJ -LRB- Long Bihn Jail ; a military prison . -RRB- . Hollowborn is in charge of a group of young soldiers who risk their lives everyday where one slip is fatal even being warned not to smoke the night before they go into the tunnels the next day because the VC can smell the smoke on them . They can even tell the brand . None of these guys want to be in the ` Nam . They all hate it . They stay away from the FNG 's -LRB- F-ing New Guy 's -RRB- because all they do is talk about home and that 's a place the Short Timer 's want to be . They also feel that the FNG 's are n't worth a salt unless they 've proved themselves in combat , but that 's hard to do sometimes as that they 'll probably be killed in the first week , so why bother getting to know them . The next day , the squad goes on a simple `` Search and Destroy '' mission , but all hell breaks loose and each man must fight for his own life in order to survive . Boll 's co-writer and producer , Dan Clarke , particularly pays close attention to detail in the script to give the story the realism it richly displays . The booby trap sequences invented by the Viet Cong based on real events are creatively deadly . Great photography by Mathias Neumann . From beautiful jungle vistas to the dark tunnels . Quite an impressive contrast . The sound is crisp and clear . The most impressive part is , is that the entire movie was shot in South Africa doubling for Vietnam and you can not tell the difference . This is Boll 's best film ... up until the last ten minutes . SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT You get to know the characters . You like most of them , but everybody dies . EVERYBODY . Who 's left to left to tell the story ? No one . At least in `` Go Tell the Spartans '' and `` Apocalypse Now '' somebody lived to tell the story . Here , you walk out of the theater , and yes , there are some intense , memorable scenes that you ca n't get out of your mind that lingers on days after , but there is no one left alive ! You 're depressed as hell ! Boll creates the best work ever and blows it the last ten minutes . Like the film , `` I Bury the Living ; '' one of the best horror movies ever made until the cop-out ending the studio wanted . It could have been a classic , if not for that . Boll should re-shoot the ending and have someone live to tell it . Its the only thing that hurts the movie is that ending , otherwise this is the best film he 's ever done . SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER END This film is realistic and well made . My only complaint with it is the ending . Other than that , Boll did a remarkable job with this movie that deals with a little known chapter in the history of the Vietnam war about a group of remarkably brave soldiers that had to do a rough job .

" Not very pleasant , but \* intense \* ! . Wow , this movie can not be described easily . While it is sometimes way too pathetic -LRB- american soldiers die too easily -RRB- , at the very heart , this movie is breathtaking and really painful -LRB- due to it 's statement -RRB- to watch . Between the scenes of war , dying and gore it works well with claustrophobia and the inevitable -LRB- you see your fate coming -RRB- ... And while it gets down to a very personal level , it says so many things about humans , the desire to live , anger , desperation , motivation and war in general ... \* Tech \* One things that really blew my mind : the tunnel-scenes could have been done by anyone at -LRB- almost -RRB- no costs !! -LRB- Students around ? Learn from that , no major explosions needed ! -RRB- But yet , those scenes where among the most intense , the most unpleasant , painful , desperate and bloody scenes I have ever seen . \* War and technology \* Besides that , the tunnels and the jungle give a fairly well impression why no technology -LRB- so far -RRB- was a major help in such a fight - when it came down to man vs. man ... Resume : not your average good-night-movie ! + In a movie-theater it soon becomes quite claustrophobic !! " ,8
" to war we go ! . People thought he could never do . . but he did and this is the best film he has made so far . Uwe Boll the German director who has be come known for the creation of some of the worst films in history . And most of them were video game adaptations . But maybe Postal was the beginning of a transformation . it was n't a very good film but at least it had some very good bits . Far cry was better but still not great . Tunnel Rats is good . though its not that great and still some visible cracks but at least its the cracks are not so wide . the dialogue is still full of problems but the plot is rather good . the action is intense and meaningful . the film was even very moving at times . I wanted to find problems with the movie but found more good points rather than bad points . which is rare in a Uwe Boll film . many of the characters were still 2 Dimensional but the music , action , plot made up for many of the mistakes . Some war films about Vietnam show the power of the American army , but this film at least shows the Americans being kicked about which I have only seen in Platoon . Uwe Boll has made a film and it is not a bad film . " ,7
" Rats , No Cheese . If you 're looking for an intricate plot , look elsewhere . If you 're looking for feel-good , shoot-em-up action , look elsewhere . If you 're looking for the latest sugar-pill rom-com with Sandra Bullock , why are you even reading this ? In Uwe Boll 's stunning Tunnel Rats , the increasingly interesting -LRB- but still no less maligned -RRB- German director has made what essentially amounts to a chronicle of the madness of war told in a confined , claustrophobic , and frighteningly intimate way . The concept and plot -LRB- a platoon of American soldiers uncovering underground tunnels built by the Viet Cong to stage ambushes -RRB- are one and the same ; and the metaphors paralleling confined spaces to the erosion of sanity are strong -- hysteria is very viscerally believable here . While the character introductions and subsequent dialogs may strike notes of familiarity to the seasoned connoisseur of cinematic warfare , it 's the unfamiliarity of the cast -LRB- with Boll regular Michael Pare being the only ` name ' actor present -RRB- that makes it all stick ; the lack of name actors only heightens the suspense , especially after they 've earned our sympathy . To see these young men trapped in confined , booby-trapped spaces -LRB- with nothing but a revolver and a flashlight -RRB- is the stuff of nightmares , even more so than The Descent a few years back . The film maintains a bleak , free-form nihilism throughout , its plot -LRB- much like the war it 's invoking -RRB- a jagged sequence of events rather than a simple matter of connect-the-dots conflict resolution . Tough , hypnotic , and refreshingly free of contrived stylistic symbolism , Tunnel Rats could very well be Uwe Boll 's masterpiece . 7.5 out of 10 " ,8
" A blunt , brutal and uncompromising film about the horrors of the Vietnam War . . When controversial German director Uwe Boll -LRB- HOUSE OF THE DEAD -RRB- first announced that he wanted to shoot an absolutely uncompromising , blunt and brutal movie about the cruelties of the Vietnam War , not just a few critics shook their heads in disbelief and predicted a major failure on all levels as they just could n't imagine that infamous filmmaker , who once knocked out four internet bashers in a boxing challenge , to tackle such a serious subject with the needed amount of tactfulness and sincerity . And I got ta admit that even though I 'm quite a huge fan of Uwe Boll 's work , I personally was n't 100 % sure either what to expect from a project like this ... But now that I finally got my hands on a DVD of said film and ultimately got to see TUNNEL RATS -LRB- I missed the flick 's short theatrical run here in Germany -RRB- , I can say with a clear conscience that all those badmouths were once again a bit too fast with their criticism and concerns , cause apparently TUNNEL RATS turned out to be a pretty neat and well-done war movie , whose intensity and brutality will not leave you cold . The film , which is set in the jungle of Cu Chi in 1968 , tells the tragic story of a group of young American soldiers lead by the hard-boiled Sgt. Hollowborn -LRB- Michael Pare -RRB- who get orders to explore and secure a complex tunnel system which the Vietcong use to move through the jungle without being heard or seen . As soon the GIs step down into the dark and narrow corridors , however , they got ta learn the hard way that their enemy is way more accustomed to the unusual surroundings and skilled in the antics of guerrilla warfare than they are and hence it does n't take long until one GI after the other has to face a merciless death and the defeat of the whole platoon seems almost inevitable In an early interview , Uwe Boll once said that one of his main intents for TUNNEL RATS was to show the absurdity and senselessness of war . Those guys who fight for their country with guns in their hands are all young , vital and full of hopes , dreams and ambitions . They got their whole lives ahead of them , but earlier than they 've bargained for , they have to realize that in a game like this there 's only losers but no winners . And when they 're left to die all on their own a thousand miles away from home , they do n't feel like heroes at all and pride and glory are about the last things that they think of The whole pointlessness of war is a constant and reoccurring theme in TUNNEL RATS and just like war itself ai n't exactly fun and enjoyment , this film is also far from being your typical good time bubblegum blockbuster TUNNEL RATS is very slow-paced , very raw , very dirty , very brutal , very pessimistic and very honest . It surely lacks the epic proportions of big war movies such as PLATOON , APOCALYPSE NOW and FULL METAL JACKET , but it makes up for this with sheer intensity and a great dose of suspense ; the latter being mainly the product of Uwe Boll making really good use of the perilous environment throughout the whole course of the movie . No matter whether the GIs are marching through the thick green hell of the jungle or crawling through the claustrophobic constriction of the tunnels , you ca n't help but feel a constant uneasiness and uncomfortableness , which ultimately finds its climax in a devastating and truly shattering finale that you wo n't soon forget . Being more of light-hearted kind of guy , I have to say that I personally did n't enjoy TUNNEL RATS as much as I enjoyed Uwe Boll 's action-packed , over-the-top no-brainers such as HOUSE OF THE DEAD , BLOODRAYNE and IN THE NAME OF THE KING , but this does n't change the fact at all that TUNNEL RATS is still one of Uwe 's most atmospheric and coherent films so far and definitely worth watching for all fans of unsparing war movies such as JOHN RAMBO and Co.

" Do n't bother . Make no bones about it , this film is TERRIBLE . Everything about the making and production of this film has been shockingly misjudged . For the first 30 minutes of this Boll tries to make you fell empathy for the character 's bleak situation for what lies ahead , but instead it just irritates you as the characters are all paper-thin and the dialogue is terrible . As the film progresses it becomes more and more silly , and is riddled with historical and tactical inaccuracies , which really make you think he should have read a bit more into the background of the actual tunnel rat units in Vietnam . At some point it almost borders on insult towards Americans in its ridiculous and unsentimental portrayal of its fighting men . If like me , you watched this film hoping for insight into this fascinating aspect of fighting in the Vietnam war , I suggest instead you read Mangold Penycate 's Tunnels of CuChi , its what Boll should have done .

" Nice plot , terrible acting . I have an odd way of picking up movies . Usually by the cover and or summary on the box . For the most part I do well with this method . Well , today was not one of them days . The movie had nice action sequences but the acting was by far some of the worst I have ever seen . It was absolutely horrible . It is sad because the story was really decent and had possible potential . I would n't rate this movie a one out of ten just because the tunnel scenes were good and kept me in the movie . If you believe in Vietnam movies should show Americans winning every battle then this movie is definitely not for you . Although , I wont be re-watching this one in the near future . If war movies are your thing . I would recommend a movie called Tae-gu-ki . It is a great Korean war movie . " ,4

" With such a unique take giving so much why did the director forget to fact check ?? . The effort of this film was GREAT !!! That said the facts expressed were all WRONG !! Wanting to give a story from all four sides . . up , down , us , them was an idea worth pursuing why then were n't the facts ? Bases in the jungle without clear visuals , jeeps ... people of all sizes fitting in tunnels noted for being the small size of the tunnelers NOPE !!! Big screw up there in an otherwise fantastic attempt to give a no sided take on the horror of war ... sorry Charlie not this one !!! I 've never seen anything from this director before and a lot of the actors were new to me , however most held the story to the limit and made me feel their fear and pain . The shots of bodily damage and reaction to being shot was from my experience pretty real . The isolation and helplessness gave a bleak and painful feeling as well . All in all I really wish the director had taken time to find out the simple facts and gives us a better effort . " ,4
" Tunnel Rats . Prolific German director Uwe Boll has become something of a spittoon for film-going audiences with his much-hated video game-based action and horror movies , such as House of the Dead -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , Alone in the Dark -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and BloodRayne -LRB- 2005 -RRB- . While the aforementioned movies range from atrocious to just below passable , his later non-game based films have earned some more positive comments too . I was skeptical about his Vietnam War tale Tunnel Rats when popping the DVD in the player last night , but in the end the atmospheric film proved out to be fairly enjoyable . The story is set in 1968 Vietnam where a platoon of American soldiers is clearing the underground tunnels that the Vietnamese troops use in their stealth missions and connections . The dark , narrow and frequently booby-trapped tunnels are anything but safe , but when a massive Viet Cong attack begins , life above the ground is just as cheap and bodies start piling up quicker than can be counted . Unlike many mindless actioners , Tunnel Rats begins rather slowly ; the first third of the runtime is spent on getting to know the soldiers as they pass time during the day and night before their tunnel mission begins the next day . The hardened veterans and enthusiastic or frightened rookies do n't feel particularly memorable or unique compared to other war movies , but some characters are at least somewhat worth caring about , such as Privates Verano and Porterson -LRB- Rocky Marquette and Garikayi Mutambirwa -RRB- . However , I do n't think the charm of the film is really in character drama anyway -LRB- indeed , according to Boll there was no script and the actors improvised their lines -RRB- ; the story works much more effectively once the action gets going because it manages to not feel like a generic carbon-copy of the Rambo series like I was worried it would . The claustrophobic tunnels are lit extremely scarcely with yellow hand-held lights that make the underground scenes feel very atmospheric even if -LRB- or because -RRB- it is sometimes difficult to see what exactly is happening on the screen . The cinematography in the scenes above the ground has a faded , washed-out look that makes the green jungle appear all the more miserable a place . Besides the visuals , the subdued score by Jessica de Rooij also supports the mood well , beginning as little more than a compilation of ominous tones but ultimately turning into a pleasantly low-key accompaniment for the battles that could have easily felt overtly banal with more bombastic music . The best scenes are saved for the last : the agonizing , nightmarish crawls through collapsing tunnels , the encounter with a frightened Vietnamese family hiding underground and the explosion-heavy fights in the Army base are all fairly suspenseful and done in a less cartoony way than could be expected judging from Boll 's earlier efforts -LRB- that is not to say Tunnel Rats would n't present a fair share of gory violence though -RRB- . The downbeat ending is left somewhat open but makes its point clear in an enjoyably laconic way . Although Tunnel Rats is not quite a masterpiece , it is a fairly well made war film and would surely have a higher user rating if Boll 's name was not attached to it . Were the characters more memorable , the movie could have been even better , but I dare to recommend it to fans of the genre even as it is now . All in all , perhaps grudgingly it must be acknowledged that Uwe Boll actually can make a good film , even if a lot of people would prefer him to remain an easy target for mockery and sarcasm . " ,7
" Uwe Boll 's war - an underground hell of a B-movie , taut , raw , spectacular , no characterization . Uwe Boll , what 's with you making good movies all of a sudden ? Perhaps Postal got him out of the stupor of churning out celluloid crap-shoots and now , more or less in his career , he 's actually trying . This does n't mean he 's always a filmmaker that people should rush out to see . There 's a reason , for example , that he wo n't have a movie play in theaters again the way he had with his video-game bullshit in the mainstream . But under the radar , he 's able to do a little more than before , with a little ambition going a ways in a B-movie set up . Tunnel Rats is such a B-movie that there are n't any really recognizable actors -LRB- not even the somewhat recognizable star of Rampage -RRB- . In that sense it reminds one of those old-school war movies of the 50 's and 60 's -LRB- Merill 's Marauder 's anyone -RRB- where the lack of recognizable faces lends further authenticity to the situations . There is n't really a firm plot for the film , but this is not too much of a problem . What 's basic to lay out is that there are a lot of intricate tunnels under the surface in Vietnam , and they 've been dug by the Vietcong as their own kind of maze . We get to know the characters , more or less , though to keep track of names might be fruitless ; we know these people more by type or by personality -LRB- one very pleasant touch is that one of the real walking clich s in war movies - the guy who prattles on and just ca n't wait to get home to his mama or wife or whatever - not only does n't get slaughtered the first chance it should happen , but he becomes a momentary bad-ass in hand-to-hand combat right in the s \*\*\* of things . The lack of characterization could be a much bigger flaw to contend with if it were a firm character piece . But aside from some early getting - to-know-you chit-chat -LRB- and one other clich , describing what it was like back home , is a little more intolerable -RRB- , when the troops start to move out and go into the tunnels , it becomes a non-stop action film . And as part of Boll 's ambition to twist the much done Vietnam-War film - a particular kind of war film sub-genre in some respects - most of the runtime is spent underground as the Americans and the Vietcong square off , in the dark , sometimes not knowing who is going to come upon the other . For two points of reference , think of the opening sequence of Casualties of War , only extended to the claustrophobic , horror film extremes of The Descent -LRB- albeit Boll is not as strong or inventive a filmmaker as De Palma or Marshall , save for the touches of claustrophobia and the ultra-grisly violence -RRB- . Boll does n't turn away from the more gruesome bits , and we should n't either . We 're in combat that is massive , all over the place , super - bloody , and it works to ratchet up the tension . We are also given a little of the other side , which is just as primitive in their reaction to the US and the US is to them -LRB- the three of them raped a woman , I must kill them all line is all we get for rationale , whatever -RRB- . But in an odd way a woman with two kids ends up getting some complexity , if only towards the end during a very intense scene where she 's confronted by another US soldier during a bombing raid . Boll could bleed -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- this over into melodrama , but does n't too much . If he 's guilty of things it 's lack of characterization and a very strong story , which should be big cinematic crimes . However , he also has a fantastic sense of pacing action , knows well where to put the camera , and gives some of the soldiers a chance to shine on screen . When it keeps its focus narrow and strong , it 's something of a triumph ... and then one has to remember it 's Uwe Boll . Once again , who knew ? " ,7
" Excellent Movie . Surprisingly unbiased and clearly exploits both sides of the war . It shows both the cruelty and barbaric behavior of the Viet Cong and the unreasonable and merciless attitude of the Americans . I am not scared easily , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes flailed in comparison of the fear factor to this movie . This movie gives the viewer an enlarged comprehension of the horror of war . It takes away the caring , democratic view of Americans and replaces it with the true fact that they 're no better than the people they 're shooting at , and when it comes down to it , it 's up to the individual soldiers . The movie also shows the physical war amazingly . The lengths the enemy will go to is exposed , and even more shocking , the lengths the Americans will go to . Overall , a terrific movie , without a doubt worth watching . " ,10
" A fantastic film and a must watch . Despite having an air of doubt over this film after reading that the director Uwe Boll was given a Razzie award for worst director I decided to watch it . I am glad I did . This film portrays the problems the US army faced with the Kamikaze Vietnamese soldiers . The Army 's job is to flush out the tunnels and render them useless , but little do they know that the tunnels they are in are actually above where they need to be . The Vietnamese suicide squad does its best to stop all this from happening . This film has blood , action , fighting , explosions and a hint of gore . The screen play is top notch and I think the director does not deserve the Razzie , he did a fantastic job . The actors are little known but still I recommend watching . My rating 8\/10 " ,8
" An uncompromising and savage film that takes no prisoners in it 's unflinching and gruesome depiction of the horrors of war . Hell is for Heroes Uwe Boll is considered a terrible director , and his films are often met with very harsh abuse -LRB- Take House of the Dead for example , and Postal -RRB- . But his 2007 film Seed , I thought , was superb and absolutely horrifying . And this underrated effort , 1968 Tunnel Rats is an uncompromising and savage look at the horrors of war ; especially at the brutality that it drives people to . If you thought Platoon and Full Metal Jacket were tough to sit through , you might be better off giving this a miss , because Boll ups the scale by one thousand as he is n't prepared to shy away from any detail or any of the horrific violence that occurred in the heart of the immense jungles of Vietnam . The film follows a platoon of soldiers in a small camp in the heart of the jungle ; a fine mixture of veterans and fresh recruits , all under the control of the brutal Lt. Vic Hollowborn -LRB- Michael Pare -RRB- , who is n't afraid to have a Viet Cong hung from a tree in view of the entire platoon . The new recruits are sickened by this , and the first half of the movie is all about character building , as we learn something about all of them , which is extremely important . Boll deserves credit here for this , as most war movies just throw us into the heat of the battle with anonymous faces with maybe five minutes of character building at the start , which is n't enough for us to get to know the characters , and thus , feel for them and enjoy the movie more when we watch them kill , face moral dilemmas , or maybe die . It is n't long before the new guys are sent out on patrol to clear their first tunnels . One was found near the camp at sun down the day before , but as one soldier says , We 're not checking out tunnels at night . A volunteer goes down and that is when the horror starts . More men drop down to get the VC inhabitants and become trapped , while up on the surface the VC unleash a massive assault on the camp just before nightfall ... Boll wastes no time , as we are immediately thrown into the action . Before the credits begin , we are down in a tunnel with a lone ` rat ' as he crawls along , alert for snakes , bamboo pits or trip wire . He calls it in : Tunnel clear , and just as he moves along , he is spiked by a trap from another shaft beneath the tunnel . Then we shift into the credits , as the song The Year 2525 by Rick Evans plays over as a chopper flies by , carrying the new recruits . A very catchy and fitting song . The film also has a fantastic score , and that mixed with some of the breathtaking shots of the jungle -LRB- It was filmed on location in South Africa -RRB- make this actually feel as if you are out there ; and you can almost feel the dampness and the humidity . The tunnels are filled with spike pits , drowning pools and trip wires . But the men go down into them nonetheless , and we are with them all the way , as the camera work here is deliberately confusing and hard to make out , giving us a realistic sense of what it must 've been like . The only light that we have in these scenes , amidst the grunts and curses of the ` rats ' as they crawl along , is the light coming from their flashlights . You can almost smell their sweat ; it 's that intense . And here 's something we have n't seen before ; we are shown the Viet Cong perspective as well , in the form of a man and a woman , played by Scott Ly and the gorgeous Jane Le . The acting is brilliant all around . Boll did n't write a script for the actors ; he got them to improvise their lines , and what a superb job they did . In the first half , when the soldiers are all wandering around the camp , eating , showering and cleaning their weapons , and then later at night as they lay in their bunks trying to sleep , we listen to their conversations of home , family , girls and loved ones . It 's all very moving and realistic , and yet again , it 's a key element in the character building that makes us care about the characters , or hate them ; and it all serves to make the tunnel sequences later on all the more intense and personal . Like the majority of films that all have their flaws , Tunnel Rats is no exception . The first thing that comes to mind is the camp that the soldiers are in out in the jungle . It 's surrounded by immense jungle , making it extremely easy for the VC to sneak up and ambush the camp , which they do . Any veteran would tell you , and anyone who has ever seen a war film before , that a camp needs a -RRB- a defensive perimeter , which would mean blowing away and hacking down the jungle around them and building foxholes , and b -RRB- watch towers and more adequate shelter and fortifications , as opposed to the tents and sandbags in this . To be perfectly honest , the camp looks more like something you 'd see in a World War II film set in the Pacific or South-East Asia theater . Uwe Boll may just be one of the most underrated directors at the moment . Because I 've seen two of his movies now and I thought them both to be uncompromisingly brilliant . But in saying that , I have n't seen his ` bad ' films , so do n't hold me to that word yet . 1968 Tunnel Rats is an excellent film that certainly does n't hold back in it 's portrayal of combat . Boll did a superb job in what I 'm sure is as realistic as we can get to it , film wise . " ,8
" Makes The Hurt Locker look boring ... . Saw The Hurt Locker 7 days prior to watching Tunnel Rats . Tunnel Rats wins in a big way !! There was no main character in Tunnel Rats , and these guys were all regular Army . I was on the edge of my seat AND emotionally attached to these characters . There were at least 10 characters -LRB- 3 or 4 of them enemy -RRB- that had some sort of character development and that takes place in the first 45 minutes of the film . It was slow at first , but once the first person enters the tunnel you 'll feel like you 're right there in Nam INSIDE THAT TUNNEL !!! I felt like I was crawling in there alongside these guys fighting my way through just trying to survive and find my way out . The tunnel confrontations were incredibly tense and gripping ! I liked how the Gooks were portrayed as well , especially the female . The production values were well above B-movie grade . The cinematography was well done with some very thoughtfully choreographed shots with the Huey and the scenery . The soundtrack was quite appropriate as well . The DVD release takes out the really gory kill scenes , but you will have seen enough to imagine what just happened . When the really gory deaths occur there is a freeze frame and sometimes a brief drop to black . If you want to see all the gory deaths later on you can choose to do so in the Deleted Scenes section . The gory deaths are so horrifying that I think it 's a good idea that they were cut out so that you do n't just zone out and miss the next 20 seconds of intense action and suspense ! If you enjoy war movies or are a student of Vietnam War history , this is a must see ! " ,9
" One of the best war films of the last couple of years is a tense action filled film . Story of a bunch of US tunnel rats in Viet Nam over the course of a couple of days is a really good , really solid action film . The plot has a bunch of replacement guys arriving at their new station in the jungle . The film follows them as they interact with the men already there and it then follows them as they go out on a mission , which unfortunately coincides with an enemy attack . Tight dark and claustrophobic this is a film that really knows how to ratchet up the suspense . You watch the film because , like the men in the tunnel you do n't know what is coming next . People die horribly in traps and fierce fighting . You wonder if anyone will get out of the situations they are put in alive . I really liked this film a great deal and can not understand how the director , the infamous Uwe Boll , ca n't make more like it . Whether Boll had directed it or not this is a very good film . I almost wish that Boll had used a different name when he made it since I doubt the film will ever get the attention it deserves because of who he is . One of the genuine surprise of the year film wise , this is a wonderful little film thats light years better than many other recent low budget war films . If you like war films I highly recommend it . " ,8
" war is futile , just like this horrible movie . . I 've always been a fan of war movies , Vietnam in particular . I like how film directors work hard to try their best to re-create the horror and brutality of war . It is very frustrating to me when you find a movie like ` Tunnel Rats ' , that seems to lack any real focus or originality . Basically , to me , this movie is awful . Terrible acting , plot less storyline -- even the costumes were bad . I do n't understand , with all the brilliant war movies out there , not to mention thousands of books about Vietnam War for references , how the director did n't put any effort into the realism of the story . It 's over-the-top gore in places just seemed unnecessary , like it was trying to compensate for the rest of this wasted movie . If you like Vietnam films , avoid this turkey and just watch one of the classics instead . " ,1
" One of the worst Vietnam War movies ever ! . This movie is really , really bad . I do n't understand who gave the money to make it . It 's real hard to point out the mistakes as there are everywhere uniforms , field gear , weapons it 's all wrong . Viet Cong wearing steel helmets , 5.56 mm mags in their weapons , most of the US gear is from the 80 's ... I could go on and on and on . I ca n't find any part of the movie worth watching , it 's unwatchable even after a 0,5 l of vodka . A real disaster . I must say , I have some knowledge about Vietnam War and read some\/watch some of the literature\/movies about this period . Anyway , I could n't find one thing right in this movie . Not a single one ... " ,1
" A piece of c \* # % . Uwe Boll , previously a purveyor of torture porn , has suddenly decided to try his hand at a war movie . This one 's titled 1968 Tunnel Rats , presumably because his viewing fans , -LRB- of which there are several in these pages -RRB- , would then have some idea of when the Vietnam war occurred . The story , such as it is , revolves around a platoon of American soldiers who are on a search and destroy mission . They uncover some Viet Cong underground tunnels in the jungle and , in the process of reconnoitering , many die horrible deaths . This is where Mr. Boll 's previous film experience comes in handy , and thus the description of some viewers here as intense . Actually it 's simply poorly staged screen violence , the main attraction of Boll 's previous film efforts , and there 's little else that adds interest to the movie . One of the worst Vietnam war movies ever made . " ,1
" The Raging Boll hits hard - again ! . Uwe Bolls Tunnel Rats has just been released on R2UK , and of course I had to run down to the store and get a copy as fast as possible . When Seed came a lot of people was impressed - except the usual Bollbashers - but who cares about them nowadays ? Seed was way more cynical than what we 've seen from Uwe before , but still had some silliness because the absurd comic book-style killer . But with Tunnel Rats Uwe has abandon every kinda comedy , satire and tongue-in-cheek . Tunnel Rats is dead serious and works very well that way . It 's a story about soldiers in the Vietnam-war that are going to clean up the underground tunnels that Viet Cong uses . Of course everything breaks into pure hell ... Boll spends some time with the characters first . Let us know them - and let the actors do some impressive and naturalistic performances . It 's not a pro-American movie ... and not a pro-Vietnamese movie either . It 's quite natural and shows the brutality at both forces . For once he injects some personality and motivation to the Viet Congs to , and as good performances as the American actors . It goes into horror-territory -LRB- almost -RRB- when the tunnels are introduced , but still keeps it realistic . The tunnels are small , because the Vietnamese is small , so it get 's extra claustrophobic for the bigger built Americans . Above the ground there 's some great action to , well worth a look for those - like me - who loves jungle action . Blood , squibs , limbs blown of , explosions and a nasty feeling of realism . There 's no super-soldiers here . People just die . The Bollbashers would celebrate this movie if there was another name as a director , if Boll used an alias . They just hate it because it 's Boll directing . I love his popcorn-flicks , but I love even more when he comes in to more darker territories and shows us what the world is about . The ending is dark and cynical , but probably more real than any other Vietnam-movie . Yeah , it 's darker than in Seed . And it shows even more the total meaningless of war . " ,8
" Outstanding Vietnam War movie . I will not spoil anything and just say the truth : This is an outstanding Vietnam war movies , and that for the following reasons : - Great acting , very `` real '' , makes you feel you are right there in Vietnam with the soldiers - Great directing , especially in the tunnels , which feel very claustrophobic . In conclusion , a great war movie . Very personal as opposed to enormous with thousands of soldiers . I think BOLL just had really bad scripts and did what he could with them . With tunnel rats it was his own ideas that really came out and he did a great job . Please watch and then rate . Do n't just think `` Oh a stupid German director '' and miss a great movie . " ,10
" Reading reviews after watching this film was thought-provoking - and artistic . Never have I watched a film with lower expectations and been so surprised . A Golden Raspberry , a win for worst director , nearly one out of four viewers gave it just one star on IMDb , and the director is , well , Uwe Boll . In addition to everything else people did n't like , the camp perimeter was we are told in the goofs not set up with ample defenses like I can suppose was done 100 % of the time in Viet Nam . The clothing was n't right and they had the wrong weapons . I see that someone was even disturbed by the wrong helicopters . And that so many voted it just one star suggests that quite a few were upset by the film , and I do see by the discussion that the film has had its share of attention . Then after two years I thought to watch it anyway . Of course just my opinion , but an excellent and unpredictable storyline , suspense , rather skillful acting , well-done cinematography , and a very nice musical score . So what can account for such a difference in opinion ? Well for one I can say that there are still very strong emotions about the war itself and U.S. foreign policy then and now . This films steps on some feelings . There was no John Wayne . Some soldiers acted like they did not know all soldiers always take cover -LRB- like they do in most movies at least -RRB- . We even see some of the Viet Cong as human beings and that can really rankle some people . And then there was a hanging with blood -LRB- well the body did drop quite some distance -RRB- , cutting up of a corpse -LRB- though with good reason -RRB- , and a excruciating end for some of the good guys -LRB- depending on who you consider the good guys -RRB- that we may be rooting for . I can recommend the uncut version for those who can handle it . I may also mention that Jane Le won the best supporting actress award at the Hawaiian International Film Festival . Not a film for everyone but I liked it . Finished seeing this film again a few minutes ago . I was even more impressed that I was the first time . That so many skewer this film tells us something about why there is so much fighting even today . People can not see through the slogans society produces -LRB- peace , freedom , their political system is evil -RRB- or recognize the mistakes of the past . Humanity is not finished with atrocities . The flag-waving let 's - kill-our-enemies mindset may pass on this film . Those more perceptive may find this film very rewarding and artistic . " ,10
" What a quality film that shows what this war was truly about . . Tunnel Rats , one the best Vietnam films ever made . While people are always willing to back Full Metal Jacket , Platoon , Apocalypse Now and others , this film really hits the mark . This film does not leave you feeling the need to throw out one liners with your friends over a couple of pints , it does not leave you believing they had some fun over in Vietnam like in Hamburger Hill when they go to the local massage parlor and get laid and drink beer -LRB- although Hamburger Hill does hit home -RRB- , this film shows exactly what fighting that war was all about . Fighting an enemy you could not find and could certainly never beat . People have been shocked by how the film was made , but how better to get a real picture of what actually happened out there . Squeezing into a tunnel big enough for very small people and not being able to take proper defences with you , not being able to breath or move properly . This film is very much a political message and what a shame these films were not made earlier when the actual war was taking place . Maybe the anti-war protesters would have been more willing to give the war vets the credit they deserve for being drafted and made to do what it is they did . This film commands respect and no matter how awful the portrayal of killing is , or how awful the darkness of the film is , this is a complete truth of what was happening . Americans bombing their own at the end of the movie , reminiscent of Hamburger Hill and that film was acclaimed . My heart goes out to the people who fought in that war , the survivors and the dead . They fought because governments ca n't simply learn to live with their differences , or they ca n't just sit down and decide to have a poker game instead . No , they gamble with other people 's lives and this leads to creative minded people like Uwe , who see a tort and do something about it , make films that show true depictions of what really happened no matter how bloody . In a couple of years there will be more films like this about the war on terror because G W wanted to line the pockets of his suit at the expense of young men and women because he ca n't tolerate other countries disagreeing with him . Well done Uwe , this film opens the mind and shows how ugly war truly is . Throw on some boxing gloves government leaders , or go fight the war yourselves . " ,9
" Dark , deep and dirty . . Writer\/director Uwe Boll 's war drama takes place in the Cu Chi jungles of Viet Nam circa 1968 . There is no rule book , no play book for war ... especially this one . Armed with handguns , flashlights and knives , Sergeant Vic Hollowborn -LRB- MIchael Pare -RRB- leads a combat unit into underground warfare with the goal to eradicate the Viet Cong resistance forces burrowed effectively in their narrow and dusty domain . Hand to hand battle not for pride ... but survival . Interesting , but nothing real special . Pare is a believable bigoted leader . Others in the cast : Nate Parker , Wilson Bethel , Brandon Fobbs , Brad Schmidt , Jane Le and Scott Ly . " ,3
" Fits Boll 's resume just fine . I used to hate Uwe Boll . Like really despise . His films were some of the worst I have ever paid to see with BloodRayne , Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead could n't even have all their score combined to get a full star out of this reviewer . As a person , Uwe Boll also repulsed me . In 2006 he challenged critics of his films to ` put up or shut up ' and get into the boxing ring with him to defend their critiques . But then , I had a revelation . Why was it that I adored the offerings of one Roger Corman all these years when his films and Boll 's are very similar in their results . Both filmmakers do their best with limited budgets and produce films that are so laughable that you ca n't help but look beyond the production values to find the entertainment in their product . In short , Corman and Boll both produce films that are un-watchable alone , but when enjoyed with friends , while having beers and yelling Mystery Science Theatre type comments at the screen , they can be fairly amusing . Tunnel Rats fits right into his resume along with Postal and In the Name of the King . Tunnel Rats is set during the Vietnam War and puts a bunch of expendable US soldiers in a position where they have to hunt the Viet Cong by exploring and hunting them in the various underground tunnels they have built under the forest battlefield . The tunnels are tight and dark , which does give a sense of claustrophobia , but does n't give you a lot to look at on the screen . The lighting is so dense with nothing more than a flashlight to illuminate a scene that you find yourself straining at the screen . Let 's face it , Uwe Boll films can give anyone a headache without having to squint for 90 minutes . So the film is pretty straight forward . One by one they go into the tunnel when the ones that went in prior do n't come back out . And one by one they all face various deaths thanks to the assorted weapons at the hands of the Viet Cong which include knives , guns and a sharpened bamboo poll . Unlike most other Uwe Boll films , Tunnel Rats tries too hard to develop character amongst the actors in the platoon . Countless -LRB- endless ! -RRB- minutes are spent learning about their backgrounds and their hopes and ambitions if they survive the craziness of the war . Unfortunately , character building is not Boll 's strongpoint . Not that I know what his strongpoint is , but just having a group of soldiers sit around and jibber jabber about the things we have heard in any and all other Vietnam films produced since Oliver Stone 's platoon induced yawns that were larger than the holes these soldiers were climbing down . There is some half descent violence . The bamboo stick through the neck was good and when the enemy circles in around the platoon in a wave of explosions and gunfire , there are some good dismemberments to keep you interested . But not enough . When it is over , if you watched it with others , I am sure that the comments uttered aloud during the screening will allow for some value . If you watched it alone , Boll owes you 90 minutes of your life back . Or at least a chance to take a swing at him in the boxing ring . www.killerreviews.com " ,3
" If War is Hell , Boll is Satan . This movie is a squandered opportunity . Uwe Boll apparently thought the best way to make a statement about the pointlessness of war was by making a pointlessly long , wound-inducing , brutally ugly and disturbingly unoriginal genre film . Here , the director had a chance to redeem himself after a series of flops and turds . In Postal , at least , he showed some promise of not taking himself too seriously , and while the end result there was n't exactly a good film , at least it was entertaining . But do n't believe the hype . In Tunnel Rats , Boll is aiming for a serious , realistic movie . The film is marketed as being `` for the fans of Apocalypse Now and Platoon '' , which by itself is a patently ridiculous and preposterous thing to say , coming from a film maker who has built his career on lowering the bar on genre films , from horror -LRB- Seed -RRB- and action -LRB- Bloodrayne -RRB- to comedy -LRB- Postal -RRB- . By making a `` war film '' , Boll has proved himself yet again as a completely derivative and wannabe director who is not concerned with either originality , artistic impact or entertainment value . What is good in this movie is stolen from other directors . What is bad in this movie is the result of bad imitation or skewed interpretation of the masters , combined with a lot of self-indulgent , amateurish drivel . To compare his works to those of Oliver Stone or Francis Coppola is an insult to the craft . Nor am I trying to be unduly harsh on the man . I do n't care that he is a popular subject of internet ridicule . I only care about the fact that he makes bad movies , with the sort of inane persistence that is mind boggling . And to stay true to his vision , the last 50 minutes of this film are some of his worst yet . Bravo , Herr Boll : job well done . But let 's start at the beginning . The movie opens up with some nice open angle shots , followed by scenes at and around the camp . The characters are introduced , some chatter is spewed back and forth , the setting is laid out in order to be upset by events to come . The characters are clich s , the dialogue is completely unoriginal . There are at least four or five variations of the theme of `` I want to go home but we ca n't ` cos we 're stuck here and war is hell . '' The movie is ridiculously excessive in its repetition of the message of `` we 're not in Kansas anymore , Toto '' . Emotions are shown without preparation or care , and we are left without any means of relating to these cardboard figures - shadows , as they are , of American stereotypes . From the first action scene on , and all the way through the laborious tunnel sequences throughout the film to the final scene , the movie shows signs of some of the worst pacing and cohesion in recent memory . The movie is about as chaotic as war , but that is not cinema verit : Uwe Boll simply happens to be the cinematic equivalent of a shell shock treatment . Maybe that 's why this movie is seen by some to be authentic in its demented convolutions , because they think that Boll has created some postmodern masterpiece here . But what they mistake for craft is simply Boll 's inability to make a coherent narrative last more than 10 minutes . And because war is all about brutal ugliness , Uwe Boll just naturally happens to have the inherent lack of vision , honesty and skills to drive that point home involuntarily . Boll IS war . Uwe Boll is the worst enemy to his own movies . He is like the Viet Cong digging tunnels underneath the movie crew 's feet , or more like a saboteur within . After he is done , little remains of a salvageable movie . He snips out all developments , abandons all his characters , fails to release tension that he builds up unnecessarily , meanders like a schizophrenic tunnel rat in a maze , throws random scenes at the viewer in a barrage of images that might as well have been edited together using an aleatory computer program or an astrological chart ... and finally , he repeats and repeats and repeats the same stupid mistakes of his earlier movies as if self-criticism and self-learning were signs of weakness . The latter half of the movie is an irredeemable catastrophe , as if even the editor gave up on this movie after the midpoint . There is such a lack of love here that one wonders if it 's not done on purpose in some cruel , twisted joke . This is certainly not Uwe Boll 's worst movie . At least Seed , Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead are even more disturbingly amateurish . But what makes Tunnel Rats perhaps more distressing than those previous stinkers is its subject matter : war . The film is so dark , gray , boring , claustrophobic and ugly that it 's perhaps his least entertaining movie yet . And it certainly fails as a message movie , because it has no intellectual honesty or artistic merit to speak of . So who is it for ? What 's the point ? I really do n't know ... The film is a completely dishonest hack job , a failure in its own terms , and a complete humor failure to boot . This movie is ugly , meandering , brutal , pointless and painfully long . Yes , in that regard , it is an apt representation of Vietnam . Thank god we 're not in Vietnam anymore , Toto . " ,3
" Not a Great Film by any Means . This film was based on true events and if the US soldiers were as badly trained and stupid as this outfit are portrayed , then it 's a wonder they did n't lose the war sooner . For example , we see two soldiers standing over a hole while comrades are below and these two soldiers see the VC coming . Do they find cover from which to fight behind ? Nope one stands up swinging a big machine gun one handed arnie style shouting at them . They have a camp in the middle of the jungle and the VC attack , right from the first tent . How on earth would they have gotten that close to a base camp ? No fences or guards on duty that day ? Please . Then the CO calls for immediate air support as they are being over-run , been over-run would have been more like it . The immediate air support did n't turn up until later when everybody had gone home , had they flown all the way from America ? You felt absolutely no sympathy with the characters , we had just about every clich d character you could think of except the chirpy cockney and the scouse scallywag . They tried to build backgrounds and personalities to the characters but failed miserably , maybe because it was done very lazily , ie having two actors discuss all the characters for our benefit while they eat . The conversation just does n't seem real . It is a shame because the film started well and the scene in the tunnels involving the mother and kids was genuinely tense but it seemed so out of place with the rest of the film which was , badly acted to say the least . I seem to remember the excellent Tour of Duty TV series covering this subject in one episode and they managed to fit in more tension and understanding of these terrifying tunnels in a fifty minute program than this film managed . I just kept thinking that 1968 Tunnel Rats was like a bad horror film where the goodies -LRB- in this case the tunnel rats -RRB- were being picked off one by one by the evil monster -LRB- the VC -RRB- in different and more nasty ways and the only mystery was who is the one that is going to survive ? Is it the guy that believes God will protect him ? The CO that is nasty to his men as a way of protecting them and preparing them for the nasties of war etc ? " ,2
" Way too many Techinical errors ! . Apart from being a terrible film with a bad script , bad acting and a bad storyline , this film had far too many errors . In the credits at the end of the movie it lists a Maarten Coatzee as the films Technical Adviser . Now the big question is , what exactly did he advise ? The film had so many technical errors i felt like i was watching another amateur made Youtube movie ! Now I 've seen my share of bad Vietnam films , but this takes the cake !! M16-a2 and m655 carbine rifles being used by U.S soldiers , Woodland Cameo helmet covers , WW2 era uniforms , post Vietnam web gear , VC using Norinco Type 84S rifles instead of Ak-47s , VC soldiers with hairstyles like they just walked off the set of Tokyo drift , and to top it off , a military outpost built deep into the jungle with no perimeter wire , no field of fire , or guard tower to be seen . Its no wonder why they where over-run so easily . If you want to see a good story of Tunnel warfare in Nam , Watch the second episode of Tour of Duty titled `` Notes from the Underground '' . For a TV show made 21 years ago , it sure does put this rubbish to shame . It really is sad that the Tunnel Rats of Cu Chi did n't get a better film . They sure deserve it . " ,2
" A Masterpiece . Just like Stanley Kubrick is very , very overrated , Uwe Boll is way underrated . Some people even dare to compare him with Ed Wood , when he was way more talented than hacks as Kubrick . I hate video-games , I never played video-games , but I always found the movies of Uwe Boll beautiful and inspired , so I guess that his movies are way better than the games in which they are inspired . Alone in the Dark was a very suspenseful and stylish film . Also , it was scary , not like trash as Cannibal Holocaust or The Shining . BloodRayne was dark , stylish and sexy . In the Name of the king was simply epic : Even when I have to admit that The Lord of the Rings films were good , I have to say that I liked this film more . Postal was hilarious and satirical : The satire and the humor were way more accurate than Doctor Strangelove . Also it was funnier . Stoic was shocking and heartbreaking , much more than A Clockwork Orange . 1968 Tunnel Rats was a better war film than Full Metal Jacket . As you see , Uwe Boll is way more talented than Kubrick . I just ca n't understand why there is so much hate against his films , he is one of the most talented filmmakers of our time . " ,10
" Historically flawed movie without a plot or any character development . It 's fair to say that this is an improvement from Uwe Boll 's previous movies , but then again that 's not saying much at all really . Not only did this movie lack balance in its portrayal of the Vietnam conflict -LRB- the Viet Cong are portrayed as misunderstood freedom fighters -RRB- , but it completely lacked any real plot ark or character development . As a result it plays out like a long snuff movie with one violent death scene after another , until it all comes to a rather dull and sudden ending . The movie does n't actually give the viewer any real background or important factual information about the US or Viet Cong tunnel rat soldiers , and as a result it starts by alienating the majority of its viewers who would know very little about this aspect of the Viet Cong war . The movie starts by introducing us to a series of characters - the US soldiers - and we are given some interesting background to these men 's personal histories , but then this comes to a rather sudden dead end as soon as the fighting begins - at which point the development of these characters completely stops . We are also introduced to three main characters from the Viet Cong , but their development is even worse - with one character who has been given a very clich d story about why he is so angry at the US , and another female character who obviously has reservations about the war , but this is never really developed any further . Once the war violence starts the movie spirals into a drawn out series of violent death scenes , with a poorly constructed and confused Viet Cong raid on the US camp - It actually appears to feature the same action sequences repeated several times , each time with different characters involved - basically it looks like Uwe Boll tried to make a very small base camp look huge with B-grade cinema tricks . -LRB- also , many of the actors do n't appear to have been trained how to engage the enemy , or how to hold and shoot their weapons as soldiers of the Vietnam war era would have been -RRB- . This movie was a real disappointment , and once the war scenes began it started to feel a little bit like a slasher flick or a Vietnam version of Predator -LRB- except without the Predator -RRB- . In the end it never actually informs the viewer about the history or complicated issues of the Vietnam war , and it does n't work as an anti-war film either - if Uwe was really trying to promote an anti-war message then it gets lost in a never ending haze of graphic violence . If you want to watch a movie that gives a more balanced portrayal of both sides , along with some important insights into the Vietnam conflict , and at the same time portrays the true horror of the Vietnam war without dishonoring the men who were forced to fight in it , then give Tunnel Rats a miss and watch We Were Soldiers instead . " ,1
" Anti-American . I realize that , being an American , I may not be the most objective about this ... but really ! This movie made the American troops look like bumbling , cruel , calloused idiots vs. the gentile , peace-loving , well trained VC . I am a veteran , and having been to war and understand the reality of the fact that both sides are human . I also understand that America is not always right . Even allowing for those things I cant give any credit here for an attempt at accuracy . There was nothing objective about the clear anti-American bias in this movie . If you enjoy watching American soldiers die then you may like this movie ... This is a horrible movie about a horrible war ... " ,1
" for younger generations to understand Vietnam . As an avid war movies fan , I was stunned by this down-to-earth story . I would recommend this one instead of watching boring documentaries . It is a great lesson in story-telling as well ... the simple truth is the ultimate scenario . The title itself does prepare us for this journey from human to animal . Never in the movie does the animal part become surreal , just plain realistic , which sets is apart . I would go so far as to say it took the opposite road from `` Apocalypse Now '' , no lyricism and theatrics . Is n't that the ultimate `` tour de force '' in movie-making ? To be able to tell a story , so visually that you feel the action , but even in black white picture and stereo sound , it would be as powerful ... The director is definitely to be reckoned with , I am now quite intrigued by his filmography . " ,10
" Not even close . This is probably one of the worst films on Nam I 've ever seen . So unorganized and unprofessional that is the guys I served with acted that way none of us would have came home . I like Michael Pare 's acting but not in this movie . The writer should have gotten his facts straight or at least talked to some real tunnel rats . Even a unit in the Army that served in Nam did n't act that way in Nam . Not that I ever saw , but my time was in the Marines and not a chance did a Marine unit ever act like this movie portrayed . zadziks from Antarctica gave it a 10 , he has no clue or is getting royalties from the DVD sells . Pure waste of time . " ,1
" Another sloppy mess . . This is one of the worst films ever done by the already talentless Dr. Boll . Now if this had some tongue-in-cheek humor or was meant to be a joke , well that would be one thing . Instead you are tortured w \/ 90 + minutes of clich ridden , over the top action , absurd dialog , and one of the most pathetic endings ever put on film . Hopefully now that all of this tax breaks in Germany have been taken away from him , we wo n't have to put up w\/any more of his drivel . However although he has no idea how to make a film , he sure does know how to get them made . How that is possible , I have no idea . This is as bad if not worse than anything he has ever done because it 's supposed to be serious which makes it all the more laughable and embarrassing . Please do not waste your time w\/this even though you can watch it free online if you have a Netflix membership , please do n't let that fool you . This is bad in every part of the word especially the god-awful ACTING the 3rd grade script which is about as nonexistent filled w\/nothingness as it can possibly be . Skip , Skip , Skip , at all costs please . " ,1
" Awful bad movie . This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made . I 'm not being prejudiced against the director . this movie just plain sucks . I know some of you like it because it has a lot of blood and gore and mangled bodies and lots of stuff gets blown up . If that 's your cup of tea , go for it . But in this movie , this is what is missing : any kind of acting , any possible directing , anything resembling realistic jungle battle , intelligent dialog , story line and plot without holes galore , intelligent soldiers , and I could go on and on . This is not how war is . This is not how it was in Vietnam . This does not show any side of humanity . It 's a jumbled up mess . A complete waste of time and money . Do not see this film . Time for the director to retire . " ,1
" Liked the acting hated the director and writer . . I liked it , the quality the acting the sound all good , but who wants too watch a movie where almost everyone dies in the end , death death death the entire movie , killing off almost the entire cast is dumb . I know that war is 90 % of what just happened but the point of a movie is too show entertaining and vivid clips , if we wanted too see something like this we would watch a history documentary . Just like Steven Kings The Mist everyone dies in the end , its pointless good acting , good plot just a good movie but directed like crap , does n't leave much room for a part two , and 95 % of part 2 movies with none of the original cast in it blows `` Starship Troopers 2 for example '' " ,4

" A Nutshell Review : Vexille . This year had perhaps seen a bumper crop of anime movies making it to the theaters , with the likes of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time , Paprika , Brave Story , Doraemon , and now , a science fiction mecha genre anime by the producer of Appleseed , Fumihiko Sori . Set in the middle of the 21st century , the world has become like that in Isaac Asimov novels , with robots having the intelligence finally to assist mankind in various tasks , which does n't discount the fact that they 'll be used in warfare too , with creations resembling those seen in Clone Wars . Coming from the largest factory in the world , Japan , for their technological genius , the world soon frowns upon their quest to fuse robots and humans -LRB- much like the brouhaha on potential abuse of stem cell technology -RRB- , and Japan decides to shut itself off from the rest of the world . Naturally , US foreign policy dictates that they are curious as to what 's going on behind the iron curtain , so they send their crack paramilitary unit called SWORD to infiltrate Japan . They are afraid of the potential threat the robots give to humankind , and more so are suspicious of the largest conglomerate and robot producer Daiwa Heavy Industries , who are dabbling into questionable robotic research . Led by Leon -LRB- voiced by Shosuke Tanihara -RRB- , it goes without saying that titular character Vexille -LRB- Meisa Kuroki -RRB- will get to save the day -LRB- hey , it 's her name on the billboard -RRB- . Interestingly enough though , this movie has its weight put on the strength of its female characters , Vexille , and rebel fighter Maria -LRB- Yasuko Matsuyuki -RRB- There are many familiar elements in Vexille both character and plot wise , but that does n't detract from the fact that there still are a number of plus points leading to the enjoyment of this movie . The designs of the mecha used by SWORD units , which is like an exoskeleton suit designed for middleweight , individual battles , are crafted to look like they just walked out of any generic Hollywood science fiction movie , as do the enemy 's guard droids which look like they were heavily influenced by Robocop 's ED209 . And with the many ships and transporters , can someone say Star Wars too ? But the one that takes the cake , is the post-apocalyptic look at Japan , making it seem like the planet of Arakis from Frank Herbert 's Dune , complete with their version of the Fremen with their tinkering prowess , and those monstrous , lethal sandworms too , which take on a mechanical facade over here , known as Jags . Even the inevitable finale seemed to have taken a leaf from Herbert 's literary masterpiece . As with any mecha-related stories , there 's always a tussle between what it means to be a human and android -LRB- erm , Blade Runner ? -RRB- , and the hopes and dreams to preserve their way of life against a megalomaniac industrialist , who shares six degrees of separation with everyone involved . But we 're not really here for rehashed cyberpunk stories involving the first 2 installments of the Animatrix , are we ? We 're here for the action pieces , and boy , they do n't disappoint . From the get go we 're treated to a full scale assault and brought to see what SWORD can do , and it played out to John Woo-ish distinction with plenty of violence set to slow motion , with numerous guns blazing that would even make the master proud . Credit goes to designing the well crafted action sequences so they are vastly different from one another , and the best has got to be the massive chase\/race sequence in the latter half of the movie . And a bonus here is the music , contributed no doubt by the genius of Paul Oakenfold . This one delivered perfectly , adding a huge dash of zing to complement the action , though I thought I heard a few bars off his Ready Steady Go ! The animation is in no doubt stunning with its photo-realism , and for a 2D movie , I thought it even beat Beowulf in the graphics , and intensity of the storyline . Vexille comes across as a recommended movie to catch before the dawn of the new year . Go see ! " ,9
" A good action CG to stand along side Appleseed . Back story : Vexille 2007 , Nihon Sakoku -LRB- Vexille 2007 , Japan National Isolation -RRB- is set in the middle of this century , at about the edge of the foreseeable future . There has been rapid development in the areas of human-form robots , able to assist humanity with running it 's civilization . Ten years ago , technology reached a point where completely human-made robots reached the peak of their potential . The trend shifted towards the augmentation of the human body , and the merging of man and machine . However , the basis and ethical implications of such technology were condemned by international treaties and organizations , and all development was banned . Japan -LRB- the world leader in robotics -RRB- was completely opposed to the condemnation , and the potential ban it found imposed on itself . Japan withdrew from the international community and went into national isolation . Ten years later , there have been no visitors allowed in or out of Japan . There has been no cultural contact , and no shared media from Japan since the isolation . However , despite the self-imposed isolation , Japan remains the world leader in the field of robotics . The robots manufactured by the conglomerate DAIWA can be seen all over L.A. , able to assist mankind with maintaining it 's civilization . Before the isolation , the robotics industry was so vital to Japan that DAIWA had grown in to a colossal mega-conglomerate , with strong ties to every part of the government . After two incidents of terrorism by DAIWA , outside of Japanese territory , America discovers that Japan may well have cyborg technology . Fearing the worst , America sends its most highly specialized team -LRB- Sword -RRB- to secretly infiltrate Japan , and gather intelligence . The CG : There 's no doubt that the CG is an important part of the appeal of this film , and for the most part , I think it comes off very well . Fans of the last major CG film released outside Japan will feel very at home with the visual style 's blend of very photo realistic elements , such as mechs , landscapes , and high-paced action scenes , with low-polly toon-shaded actors . Although landscapes , mechs and characters are all very pleasing to the eye , the one complaint I have is that the characters sometimes suffer from very stiff movement , where motion capture seems to not have been used . Sometimes this stiff movement will happen between cuts in the middle of a scene , which tended to remind me that I was watching a CG movie . The Music : The film also follows a similar flare to Appleseed , in its choice of dance and electronic artists such as Basement Jaxx , Boom Boom Satellites , Carl Craig , etc , and other more aesthetic tracks by Paul Okenfold . The blend of music does a good job of making the movie come alive , without sounding forced . The story : The story was the most important thing for me , and probably the hardest to criticize . I enjoyed the story very much -- the progression is smooth , and easy to follow . The characters are presented well , and developed in enough detail to satisfy the viewer . The story progression starts very quickly , and immediately moves into meat of the story , which is infiltrating Japan . The story is spread out with a lot of action scenes , no doubt , because this is a CG movie . Most of which do a job in telling the story , but truth be told , are mostly for eye-candy value . The main criticism I have of the story comes down to the complexity and presentation . I think as a CG film , Vexille did n't have enough time to devote to its story . With a story so central to people and events of the past , I feel Vexille falls short in its delivery of everything it set up -- including the back story . Because of time constraints -- probably both in production and running time -- most of the story 's revelations and plot points happen quite close together , which means the viewer 's attention is often pulled away from one revelation to a new facet of the story , which does tend to dull the experience in the more dramatic scenes , and leaves little time to savor the experience . In all honesty , I think a more expanded Vexille story could have easily filled another film , with a little bit still taken out . Of course , this is a natural part of cinema and story-telling , but it does n't make it any less disappointing . Final Verdict : I think Vexille is quite a solid CG film that stands apart from Applesed , with its own qualities , and enough differences to enjoy it for what it is . Although I was slightly disappointed by story in what I , personally , wanted to see , I think that just shows it to be a fairly well-balanced film , that I would recommend to anyone with a taste for action , CG or Japanese entertainment .

" Everything `` Appleseed Ex Machina '' should have been ! . Went into Vexille on the heels of the disappointing Appleseed Ex Machina and was BLOWN AWAY . Everything about this is top notch ; the storyline , while involved , is still easy to follow and very engaging . You care about characters when they die , even the ones with limited screen time . For a standard -LRB- read : non HD -RRB- disc , the image is fantastic , though I watched it on a PS3 so the upconverting may have helped . The surround sound mix is totally immersive and goes a long way to bring you into the story . The action sequences , while somewhat derivative , are brilliant and very well staged and executed . All of this is served spectacularly well by the music , which is a combination of Oakenfold 's signature breakbeat techno and selected songs by other artists , and is never off putting or out of place . Also , the anime style , a blend of cell shaded 2D and CGI , is reminiscent of Appleseed , only a bit more fluid and stylized . The Japanese audio track is solid as to be expected , and to my surprise the English dub is actually very well done . Bonus points for that . All told , Vexille is a must buy for cyberpunk , sci fi and anime afficionados , and is definitely reference material for your home theater system . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . " ,10
" Wow ! Wow ! Wow ! . Where did this movie come from ? I rented it with reserved anticipation because it looked like another generic anime action movie . I had no idea I was about to witness the greatest animated cinematic experience of my entire life . Over the past few years I 've grown fond of Japanese anime action films . My favorites are `` Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children '' , `` Appleseed '' , `` Karas : The Prophecy and Revelation '' , and `` Ghost In the Shell . '' Yeah , I also like a lot of the artsy stuff like `` 5 Centimeters Per Second '' , `` The Girl Who Leapt Through Time '' , and the most of the Studio Ghibli portfolio , but nothing wets my palette like a great anime action movie . And my goodness did `` Vexille '' wet my palette ! In the year 2077 , an elite commando unit infiltrates Japan to expose their technological secrets to the world . Character development is weak , but the storyline is excellent , with plenty of engaging scenarios , unexpected surprises , and formidable antagonists . The visuals are outstanding and the score is unorthodox and refreshing . The action scenes are also stunning . Whether it 's a mansion infiltration , a high speed motorcycle pursuit , or an escape from enigmatic machina , the choreography , editing , and placement of the virtual camera are all top notch . One 11-minute scene is unquestionably the most nerve-racking and utterly spectacular action\/suspense sequence in the history of animated cinema . Nothing comes close to this in the world of anime action . Nothing . Now , anyone who reads my other IMDb comments knows that there are two things that I really hate : Hollywood movies and art-house snobs . Of course , I 'm sure that those stuck-up snobs will urinate all over this movie due to the relative lack of character development , but `` Vexille '' thrives so much on the action and storyline that the characters earn our concern because of how they are absorbed within this exceptionally crafted conflict . This is NOT a brainless action movie . The aforementioned 11-minute extravaganza does not exist for eye candy and superficial beauty alone -LRB- like most of the scenes in `` FFVII : Advent Children '' -RRB- . It has a significant emotional weight behind it which makes the viewer clench their seat in apprehension for every single second of the entire sequence . I know , I know ; the snobs would rather watch a couple kids walk around in a war zone collecting rice for two hours instead of an entertaining action movie . So maybe they should just spare us the `` high and mighty '' routine and not even bother watching this movie to begin with . -LRB- God knows they should 've skipped `` The Machine Girl . '' -RRB- One enigmatic complaint I 've heard on the web is with regards to the dialogue . Some have claimed it to be `` cheesy '' , but I honestly can not recall more than one or two sentences that apply . -LRB- Believe me , I know cheese when I see it . -RRB- Most of the dialogue is rather intelligent and there is a noticeable lack of melodrama . Seriously , there are virtually NO eye-rolling moments in this movie , which is a huge positive . I honestly can not express in words how awesome `` Vexille '' is . It 's almost like I 'm in a state of shock or something , because I just ca n't get this movie out of my head for a split second . Things might change over the course of weeks and subsequent viewings -LRB- of which there will be many , I promise you that -RRB- , but as of this very moment , this film may have just cracked my Top 20 All Time list -LRB- live action included -RRB- . Just watch it and judge for yourself . From the very first shot right up til the end , this movie is just non-stop entertainment . And why on earth are theaters showing some stupid kung fu panda tripe instead of this spectacular action film ? " ,10
" See it . completely original story line , amazing animation . Enough action , incredible acting . I really got involved with the characters in the story . It was interesting to see how it all went down in the end . Its so different then any other movie I have seen this year . You can make parallel of any other sci-fi film . But if Vixelle borrows from any film , it turns it around and does its own way . The fast past action slows down in the middle to engage you in the characters . Its great , like the main character Vixelle , she wakes up in a town , and is lost . You are lost . In no time , the plot is dropped and personally left speech less . Can not recommend this enough . Well that and Death Note . " ,10
" I was bored to death ! . First of all , I 'm a huge anime fan . I also watched everything about Ghost In The Shell . GITS has a great story and also writers of GITS has great intellectual knowledge . Sometimes you feel you need to learn more about political issues . In terms of science , GITS is still untouchable . From scratch to the end , it was full of clich and what about the technological talks . I 'm an engineer but even anybody could understand it 's all fake . Rule number one , if you had no knowledge about the technology in detail either go and learn something or give up writing something about it . Dialogs and drama scenes were terrible . I just liked the soundtrack . That 's all ! I do n't know how the people can write too much good things about this movie . I suggest them to watch the whole GITS and then watch this garbage . " ,4
" Impressive all around . Okay , so if you 've read all of the other reviews then you know that the animation of this film is AWESOME ! It 's an excellent step forward for hybrid animation . Also , though not all of the reviewers agree , my opinion of the action in this film was that it was sweet and sick -LRB- in the most radical fashion . -RRB- For the animation and action alone , this film is totally worth the price of a rental . Which brings us to the plot of the film ; while some reviewers thought the plot was empty or lacked merit , I am of the opinion that those reviewers probably did n't pay attention to all of the dialog . The plot was well developed , more believable than several of the big-budget live-action Hollywood films -LRB- such as The Happening , which totally sucked , -RRB- and played along the social issue of fear of technological invasiveness quite nicely , though it was a rather formulaic script . The dialog was a little weak , and there was n't much for serious character development , but the nonverbal scripting played quite well . After all , this was an animated action flick , and quite frankly it was one of the better offerings from the anime genre in recent years . To recap , this is worth the cost of the rental if only for the visual imagery . However , if you have a well developed sensibility for the suspension of disbelief , then you will also likely enjoy the story as a whole . I know that I certainly did . " ,8
" Full of plot holes and superficial characters . There 's two good things in here : the animation and the -LRB- very -RRB- basic premise . Once the veil of mystery is lifted about half an hour in , and explanations start being offered , the whole film degenerates pretty quickly . We have an evil genius type of bad guy with thin motivation for ... taking over the world , of course , because he needs test subjects for an experiment . Does that sound believable to you ? Granted , it 's all fiction , but it has to be at least a little authentic . Anyway , the good guys are n't much better . In fact , they 're extremely generic : we have the main girl , who 's extremely emotional in spite of being part of the film 's version of SWAT -LRB- who also carry out CIA-type missions -RRB- . Then we have a hard ass girl , who 's the main girl 's ex . Both girls are pretty much eye candy and nothing more . Then we have the dude they 're both after , who does nothing except getting captured , thus being in need of rescuing by the two girls . Then we have ... the plot . Which is full of holes so big Leonidas could throw in the whole Persian army inside it in the blink of an eye . You 'll see what I mean if you decide to watch this . If you do n't ... well , basically there 's a company taking over Japan , on its own , and turning it into a wasteland . How does a single company take over a whole country ? How does it fall so easily after two girls infiltrate it when it 's supposed to be so powerful ? Beats me . So much more could have been done with this with some more thought . That 's really all it required . The writers sitting down and figuring out some tighter storyline rather than getting the easy way out and shrugging off all coherence . " ,4
" One of the better anime style films I 've seen in a long time . . I really liked the story in this film . Easily one of the best anime stories I 've seen . I 'd say it 's like `` Ghost in the Shell '' meets `` Resident Evil '' . This film is an Action , Sci-Fi with a bit of a drama , horror undertone . The visuals are amazing . It has strong CG look but the textures almost looked hand colored . It has a real unique look to it . I ca n't explain . The score seemed a bit thrown together . The songs did n't seem to fit into what was happening on screen . Paul Oakenfold did a pretty poor job with the score if you ask me . The sound effects were well done and the voice acting was good . This film is worth seeing for it 's great story and rich animation . " ,8
" Could 've been so much more . Ping Pong is one of the greatest and most well-directed sports movie ever made . I am quite disappointed Souri Fumihiro 's second attempt turned out to be such a failure . The setting of this film was extremely creative and promising . Japan became a closed nation in 2067 in retaliation against international restriction on robotic technology . In the past 10 years , no one has seen the true Japan was an extremely impactful quote to begin the story . Unfortunately , things take a downturn once the heroine reaches Japan . Surprisingly , people in Japan was living in a nearly homeless condition , and Tokyo had turned into one large slum . I must say I was a bit disappointed I would n't see all the amazing technologies , but it was a nice twist that offered another promising story . What really disappointed me was how there were so many things that did n't make sense . If no one had seen Japan for 10 years and their guard was so perfect , how did Vexille and team so effortlessly infiltrate Japan ? The very existence of those Jags were way too random and its structure makes absolutely no sense . What was its power source ? Why the worm structure ? It just felt like they needed a device to show off the computer graphics . Another thing is , how can a company become so powerful that it completely control Japanese government ? No amount of corruption can allow virus injection to the entire population . And why , oh , why nobody in the street was surprised to see a white girl walking around , when no foreigner had visited Japan for 10 years ? I understand this movie is a science FICTION , but all stories must be plausible given the setting . Even SF films must give its viewers acceptable explanations . Other than its story , this movie had many other disappointments . Some scenes were excessively cheesy , even for an anime , and other than intro , music choice was very poor . The most disturbing thing was the inconsistency in computer graphics . Background scenes , various machines , and special effects were fascinating , yet all the characters and some other objects were in extremely low quality that reminded me of PlayStation blockiness . Characters also seemed to be very stiff and movements seemed very unnatural . I know Japanese films have much lower budget than American films , but a 2007 3D animated film with less convincing CG than 1995 Toy Story is simply unacceptable . " ,4
" cool anime sci-fi . It 's 2067 and Japan has become a nation completely cut off from the rest of the world because it refuses to adhere to a U.N. mandate banning the development and manufacturing of human-like androids . The nation has also set up a sophisticated magnetic force field that effectively bars all outsiders from entering its borders . S.W.O.R.D. is a secret U.S. special forces team sent in to find out what diabolical activities are occurring on the inside . The main character , Vexille , is a feisty female member of this special ops force . `` Vexille '' is a stylish and energetic dystopian fantasy , marked by imaginative storytelling , exciting action sequences , and animation that is a canny mixture of art deco , Soviet-era agitprop - with its heavy emphasis on facial shadowing - and technology-based futurism . Nicely done . " ,7
" Braindead plot . Horrible movie , the plot is so stupid beyond imagining . So I 'm not gon na even try to here . Well the plot is like this evil corporation has already took control of the entire country of Japan . But instead of using the country to develop some mega super weapon like what everyone thought it was doing and be generally bad ass , it instead decides to : a -RRB- Wipe out its own country 's total population b -RRB- Wipe out all its own infrastructure c -RRB- Restrict itself to to a tiny tiny island where its easily destroyed d -RRB- Fire or kill all its employees until there 's only a few dozen security guards and one android of dubious loyalty . And you wonder why they failed . Christ even James Bond villains have more brains than this ! " ,1
" A finely crafted and stunning masterpiece . When I first came across this movie online I checked out the plot synopsis on here and decided to give it a look . I was expecting lots of fighting in the future style sci-fi , but instead found this to be an incredible and profound film which has yet to leave my mind . First off , the special effects are amazing . There were many scenes throughout this film that blew me away . The camera angles , choreography , and the atypical soundtrack were all done and chosen impeccably . There is a particular action sequence in this film which had me riveted to my seat and completely engrossed to my screen . A lot of people have said that the dialogue is pretty dry -LRB- they 're right -RRB- , but I found that the depth of this story is almost completely revealed through the images on the screen than through the narration . As a result , the limited dialogue allows you to insert many of your own emotions into the film making it a very unique and personal experience . Overall , the film is an enthralling story of survival and salvation in a very bleak and downright frightening future . I guarantee this movie will be on your mind after your done with it and many of you will probably end up revisiting it . A must see . 8\/10 . " ,8
" Fun 3D CGI sci fi with great ideas , but no character development . There are different elements in this film that simply clash with each other . There is the 3D animation that brings some very cool effects , but then almost no facial expression . Watching the film is like waiting for an in game animation to end so you can continue playing . Then there are the ideas in the film , that are very bold , but they are not really backed by a political and technological realism . The elite team that starts the film comes with these cool robotic suits , but they serve almost no purpose in the story . And I could go on and on . The thing is that I liked the film , but it was like a jagged experience -LRB- pun intended -RRB- since there were great scenes , then really bad ones , then some great again , then some bad ones again . All ups and downs . When I think of this movie compared with others , what comes in my mind is Final Fantasy . The same weird immersion in a 3D world , but not really a strong emotional experience . Bottom line : better than most , could have been better . Nice sci-fi , all 3D CGI . " ,7
" better than Appleseed . I just finished viewing Vexille , then I read the review from TwitchFilm , and I got ta say I completely agree with the reviewer 's assertion . While Appleseed has a number of interesting scenes , this is the stronger film overall . The animation is crisp and believable , the settings are beautifully realized , and the narrative is stronger by far and carries with it a poignant message of dissension to benign racism and ultra-nationalism . There 's a recurring scene in the film in which a `` community leader '' sits vacantly and hangs his head . This basically captures in a snapshot my view of the adult Japanese person - the conservative fatalist who contemplates a pressing issue for a long time and in the end makes the wrong choice . I 'm glad to be proved wrong in this case . 8\/10 " ,8
" One of the best anime movies of all time . This is a fantastic movie ! I had never even heard of it until I was scrolling through action movie titles on the internet . I read the reviews and decided to check it out for myself . I was so impressed that I considered quitting my job to travel around the country promoting it . But seriously , the film is visually stunning , has a great plot , and touches just about ever emotion a person can experience . I highly recommend it . There is enough action in this movie to satisfy even the most insatiable movie buff . Most of the time I forgot I was watching an animated movie . Set in the not-so-distant future , this film creates a plausible scenario of a mega corporation so bent on the advancement of technology that it forgets what humanity is all about . I was on the edge of my seat from the very beginning . " ,8
" A Brilliant Sci-Fi Action Film . Shades of the Matrix , District 9 , and Blade Runner combine in this brilliant film about humanity and mechanization . While it certainly draws inspiration from a lot of sources , it is very original and worth a watch . I found the exploration of the Japanese culture fascinating as well from an anthropological standpoint . On a technical level , this animation is truly astounding . It looks like a Michael Mann scifi film - if somebody gave Mann 200 million dollars . Hopefully , this technology will improve even more so interesting , intelligent stories can be made without costing an incredible amount . Watch this film . Definitely worth the 90 minutes . " ,10
" Just incredible ! . You do n't have to think twice about seeing this Vexille is literally one of the best action packed animes to have come out in recent years . With highly anticipated features such as Appleseed : Ex Machina falling short of the desired standards , it is undoubtedly the best cyberpunk anim in a long time . The CGI \/ Cel - Shaded hybrid visual style featured earlier in the likes of Appleseed has been taken to a whole new level with ultra - realistic mecha and mind - blowing visual effects . The characters also look great , especially Vexille she is uber - cute -LRB- reminds me of Deunan from Appleseed -RRB- . And my personal favorite , the JAG 's , they really offer one hell of a show and are unparalleled in animated film history . Just think of huge vortex - worms made up of zillions of metal junk ! The story however could have been more original though it strives to make up for it towards the end . The first 15 20 minutes were kind of redundant but as the plot develops , the detail , action , everything starts getting better . The sound design is quite fine , though I think the JAG 's should have been more powerful . The background score was average with bold electronic beats and techno grooves . " ,7
" superb cg animation . i have to say , this is one original movie.at least i haven ' seen anything like it.the GC animation is stunning , very detailed and clear.the action sequences are first rate.the dialogue was good as well.there are n't too many dead spots in this particular production.and i thought the voice casting was superb , particularly for the characters of Vexille and Marie.the general storyline is original , though it may incorporate elements from other films into it.ti 's basically science fiction tale that takes place in the next fifty plus tears or so.it 's one interesting what if scenario.but one of the neatest thing about this particular movie are the characters and concepts they came up with.for me Vexille is an 8\/10 " ,8
" Decent anime . I really enjoyed this flick . Animation is great , plot is decent , and characters are sufficiently formed -LRB- for action movies -RRB- . To be honest , there are some noticeable flaws , made while patching the story , but all in all , I am more than happy for watching it . It 's a mixture of Ghost in the Shell , Akira and AppleSeed , but nevertheless it has it 's own original storyline . At some part it put me on thought that something similar could happen to human kind , especially the disease prevention . You too can easily draw parallels with recent events . At the beginning you are presented with who the bad guys are and who will probably save the day at the end . Also , you are pretty fast being aware that this movie will be filled with action and cyber-blood , and with sporadic love story . All in all , very good action anime . " ,7
" Do n't listen to the haters . Watch this movie ! . \*\* SPOILERS \*\* I bought this movie on DVD expecting to get me through a boring night or at least give me cheap laugh at it 's pitiful attempt to ` be ' \/ ` beat ' Appleseed . 20 Minutes into the movie . I was hooked , shocked and more importantly - GLAD I bought the film ! What 's so good about Vexille that it -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- tops Appleseed ? It 's everything as a whole ! First off , the storyline . Its set in Japan in the near future . Although many say it 's too weak , not interesting enough and rather linear . They fail to realize the brilliance of the story ! Instead of the typical and overused human 's creating robot like humans Vexille does something which is the exact opposite ! It focuses on a crazy Company called ` Daiwa ' which develop a virus that slowly mutates\/transforms the human DNA into metal ! Then they get the government to unleash an illness that requires the whole Japanese population to be vaccined . -LRB- Really , the vacination is the mutation virus -RRB- . Slowly the body turns into metal then finally , the virus attacks the brain causing the brain to be taken over by the virus and then controlled , so that Daiwa can control the humanoid 's ! That 's the jist of what has happened in Japan . I 've spoiled some parts of the story , but left out what actually takes place IN the film . Now the story does have some weak points like not explaining WHY the Daiwa company are wanting to turn human 's into humanoids -LRB- of course they want to take over the world , but WHY exactly ?!? -RRB- . And HOW exactly the government got involved in this ... But that should all be explained in the next movie which will probably be a Prequel . The CGI\/2D Shaded graphics design is nothing new , it 's used in Appleseed . The design of the characters are much like Appleseed too , but what really makes it unique are the robots and the ` jags ' ! I 've watched a lot of anime 's and Japanese movies and let me tell you . The Jags are probably the most unique robot\/enemy I have ever seen ! They are the main reason why this movie differs enough from Appleseed . Again , the only problem is , we are told WHAT the Jag 's are doing in Japan , but we are n't told HOW exactly they are built and etc. . Another problem I hope the second movie deals wth . The movie is filled with a mix of action , drama and tension to keep you interested and not bored . Overall , Vexille is a good compact eye catching movie that will hook any anime\/robot lover from start to finish . Give it a solid 8.5 \/ 10 . " ,9
" Beautiful to look at , but you might as well mute it . . This was a very good looking film . The characters were well done and the machines and robots looked excellent as well . Just as its known that for every time you have a good experience you tell one person , when you have a bad experience you tell ten , so goes this plot-less film . I thought that this looked very similar to the animation of the `` Appleseed '' movies as the screenplay was written by the same guy . Too bad that the first `` Appleseed '' -LRB- although not too great in itself -RRB- did circles around this utterly meandering story . I am not sure who thought that this had a complete story to begin with . It very much seemed like they just decided to do a bunch of cool CG then decided to fit in some sort of storyline as an afterthought . As I wrote in my heading , you will probably get just as much out of this with the mute button on as you would with it off . I would suggest skipping this unless you are a hardcore Japanese Anime fan . If you want to see something good , try watching `` Appleseed '' or the classic `` Ghost in the Shell , Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within , or Akira . '' " ,4
" Good for genre in question . . From what i can see in most of the negative comments . it is like most film critics . the comments are being made with very little , if NO prior experience to this group of specialist animation . Most of the `` vexille '' story line has been insinuated in the Appleseed series . if you watch the Appleseed films and read a couple of the early comics , you will have the prior knowledge to fill in the gaps in this `` weak story '' . The way this film has been produced is stereotypical to Masamune Shirow 's writing and i would assume it is an impression of Shinji Aramaki 's and John Woo 's directing . however i 'd agree that this film is not for those who are new to Japanese animation as a lot of this is too close to home and yet too unbelievable .

" Wonderfully animated ! . This 10 million dollar project paid off with the most advanced 3D anime rendering technologies with many features not presented in animes ever . A worthwhile experience even though the storyline was not as exciting as that of Matrix or Star Wars . The texturing of the characters moved on to real-time 3D instead od classic animation of anime . This feature was presented in Final Fantasy movies , but that 's a different level of High Dynamic Rendering as well as post filtration of texils . The most amazing part might be the rendering of the metal worms used in the movie , which is real-time particalized with physics processors . This might not be an astonishing feature to those who own 8800 Ultra graphics cards in Sli for gaming , but as for a movie and the dust particles , it 's beyond your reach . " ,10
" Eye opener . An EXCELLENT film that touched on every emotion I have within , An American Opera effected me deeply . It opened my eyes to the magnitude the crisis Hurricane Katrina had on animals . This film showed how some can be so compassionate , while others respond in a different way , by being so heartless and thinking that by shooting these innocent animals , the problem will go away . This film was so very informative and REAL , not masked by actors , it showed real people from all over , coming together to make a difference in the lives of animals during a crisis . It showed me that I , myself can made a difference . Thank you , Tom McPhee , for opening my eyes and making me realize that something CAN be done . Because of your film , I will be volunteering my time for disaster relief . " ,10
" A wonderful , important film ! . I loved this film ! It presents a side of the Katrina disaster that was n't covered as well as it could 've been , and serves as a warning that this sort of thing could happen again if we 're not proactive and vigilant . Tom McPhee presents this sensitive subject matter in a very non-sensational way , covering all the bases as he does so . His interviews with those who lost pets , those who helped return lost pets and those who stood in their way were both professional and unbiased . I thoroughly enjoyed the music used in the film . Not only is it engaging , it helps tell the story . Now when I hear a song from the movie , I 'm immediately reminded of the scene in which it was heard . More than anything else , this wonderful film is a call to action for all pet owners to make sure that they 're prepared to include the four-legged , slithery or feathered members of their families in their emergency preparedness plans , and to make sure their communities are planning for pets , too . An American Opera is a film I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who cares about animals and their welfare . It has it 's intense moments , so parents will want to screen it before showing it to younger children . It 's a great movie , and an important historical document . " ,10
" Truth ... . That was the most emotional roller coaster I have been on . It was beautifully illustrated , the musical selections fitting , the stories were gut-wrenching . It is truth . I was disgusted by the lack of coordination , yet proud of the many rescue volunteers and the lengths they went to continue to rescue these helpless sometimes trapped animals . Tom McPhee unearthed facts I had not known , and exposed them for us ... and I became infuriated . I can only hope karma will catch up to them sometime soon . McPhee covered all sides fairly , giving all a chance to state justify their strategies ... I absolutely LOVED it . Yet , I remain sickened by the truth it exposes as well . As I believe we have not learned , politics and power will still rule the day for those in higher places than the average rescuer . I believe as Martin Luther King believed and once said , Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter . Mr. McPhee has not , and will not remain silent . He teaches us without bias . We need only listen . He simply presents truth , and allows us make our own determinations . Remain silent , or learn . McPhee created a beautiful documentation of history that many are not aware , but need to be . Every animal lover needs to know this story . And be prepared . Be ready to speak up , to act , to learn , and not repeat mistakes . I am so happy he created this picture , but I am sure it had it 's emotional toll . And I am sure those who lived it , feel it today ... as if it were yesterday ... To Mr. Tom McPhee I simply say THANK you for creating this and sharing it with the world . I only hope EVERYONE will see this , and know the truth . Because they need to know the truth . And react . Then act . We can not afford to make the same mistakes . We can not call ourselves a humane nation and continue down the same path . In conclusion I simply state : 2 thumbs 4 paws up !! ~ Kristy S. " ,10
" American Opera Sings Out The Plight Of Animals . Salman Rushdie once said , If you want to give voice to the voiceless , you 've got to find a language . Tom McPhee gives that voice to the animals , who suffered during Hurricane Katrina , in his film , An American Opera . The film opens with an homage to Apocalypse Now ; an aid worker looks up at a revolving fan and the camera overlooks the flooded areas of Louisiana . The next eighty-seven minutes takes you on an unforgettable journey through the salvaged areas of New Orleans and the stores of heroism and shock concerning man 's best friend . An American Opera is not just a documentary ; it is a juxtaposition of different documentaries blended into one . The editing of interviews between the animal rescue workers and members of the American Humane Association mirrors the split screen style used in Woodstock and Saul Swimmer 's Concert for Bangladesh . The unflinching eye through the halls of the abandoned St. Bernard 's School , in which 33 dogs and cats were killed by the St. Bernard Sheriff 's Officers , compares favorably to the shots of Abu Ghraib from Errol Morris 's Standard Operating Procedure . An American Opera is a stunning piece of citizen journalism . Tom McPhee carries on the torch once lit by John Huston during his days as a documentary filmmaker during World War II as he examines a world not so often told by today 's 24-hour media circus . Get ready to be shocked and inspired by An American Opera . " ,8
" It was truth , plain and simple ... . Oh my goodness , I loved this movie . It was real . It was truth . And yes , it was operatic . This is not a typical documentary . It never preached to you , it simply showed you what happened after Katrina and leaves you to decide how to feel . Some people have a problem with movies like that because when people see a documentary , they expect to be schooled in something or preached to . This film does n't do that . But it does show the whole spectrum of humanity . You have people doing really awful and really amazing things . As someone in animal rescue , this film hits the nail on the head . You see so many horrible and wonderful things and it is both that keep you going . Most documentaries that I see look like a 60 Minutes news special or A E Biography : you see lots of shots of people walking up and away from things while a voice over tells you the facts . An American Opera is more than facts ; it 's emotion playing out on screen . Most documentaries hit you in the heart ; this film hits you in the gut . An American Opera is not for wimps . You will cry , laugh , get angry , cheer for the heroes , and most of all , you will leave the theater wanting to do something . This film activates you . You leave the film with a sense of personal pride , a self-call to action : one person can not change the world by helping one animal , but they can change the world of that animal . A quick note on the soundtrack : the music in this film is in the vein of Garden State very earthy , organic , and down-to-earth . My iTunes has grown a lot because of the undiscovered , amazing talent this film brings to the big screen . " ,10
" Very moving movie ... . Katrina was devastation , pure and simple . The break down in the fabric of New Orleans society was not something that was portrayed through the media . As usual , we see what we are supposed to see ... no more , no less . Tom 's portrayal of the plight of animals after Katrina was bare-boned and showed us the painful reality of how things really were . We saw only a small piece of the aftermath , I can only imagine what it would be like to see the whole picture . Unless a person has experienced this kind of trauma , they can not know what toll it takes on the mind and how it changes our perception of things and in that , changes the decisions we make . Tom did a wonderful job producing this film . It was moving and elicited many emotional responses in a very short period of time . People need to see this . " ,8
" Unfulfilled promise -LRB- spoilers -RRB- . What is the point of this documentary ? From a film perspective this was not worthwhile . The film editing was bad . It seems that much of the film was a forum for someone 's favorite iTunes list . Many images are frankly irrelevant to the film . Little continuity . I think the filmmaker is stuck with footage that can not be redone and somehow threw it all together . I 'm amazed that anyone is rallying behind this as a film . I understand that in a crisis situation such as this , some footage will be choppy , shaky , etc which adds to the experience of the crisis . However , even in the controlled environments - interviews after the fact - the camera shakes , moves in out unnecessarily , and gives ridiculous close-ups . There was precious little information about any pet rescue . A few statistics thrown in . Jane Garrison 's story is compelling and this should be more about her alone . Sub-lines would be the inter-agency conflicts , the animal murders by law enforcement , and REUNIONS with pets . A fuller investigation of these on film would make it worthwhile . I think there are many promising story lines that are just dropped . What is in the film does not gel at all to make a documentary . The film ends with some random images from the Barkus pet parade . What connection did this have to anything about the animal rescue , just because it was New Orleans ? I 'm getting even more angry as I type , thinking how much of a waste this was . " ,1
" What ? . Now I respect the guy for making the effort , and yeah it was interesting to see how the film makers tried to get over the technical difficulties and the like , but honestly , I swear to god , this was the worst film I have ever ever seen . And I ca n't even say why ! It should have worked , everything was there , but it just seemed to miss the mark , consistently . Now , I would recommend this film for aspiring filmmakers as an example how to bypass certain budgeting restrictions , as in this respect , it did work , but as an actual movie ? No thanks . It was like some parody of student films . There was some interesting camera work , but then , and especially in the dialogue scenes , there was the most awful , awful talking heads thing going on , the most static and boring shots I have ever seen in a motion picture . Now I imagine it was all shot on DV camera , and there have been some interesting things done in DV , and certainly , I think it should be considered the way of the future . I mean you only have to look at some of David Lynch 's work , and especially inland empire , to see just what can be done in the medium , but it is unredeemed dreck like this , which consistently mark DV , and DV film-makers as amateur , when it need n't be ! Please , please , to the film-maker : actors , real actors please . INTERESTING shots , especially in scenes of dialogue , something that lifts it a little , and most importantly of all , get a screenplay that says something new about the human condition . Budget restrictions need n't be restrictions on the quality of the drama ! of the uplifting experience that comes from learning something new about ourselves through drama . " ,1
" Even Worse Than Batman And Robin . The worst film I have ever had the misfortune to come across . The Director 's name is Bland , which kinda sums it up for me . So bad in fact that me and a friend spent the whole film crying with laughter at just how bad it was . The acting was so wooden that a Hayden Christenson and Orlando Bloom hybrid could have done a better job ! The camera work made it feel like we were out on the streets with Jerry Springer 's film crew , and the storyline was simply shocking . There were also inexplicable overdubs of people 's voices ! It was all summed up when in a hotel room , the lead male character stands up , goes to leave the room , but forgets where the door is . It 's simply embarrassing ! Awful ! " ,1
" If you want to ruin a night watch this ! MAYBE A SPOILER ! . Man this is a lame scary movie , the dialogs and the sound is more like from a adult flick . The camera angels is like a bad hair day . Usually i like b-horrors but this one is not on this scale whatsoever . I think it feels like a home made horror to me and not something with a budget over $ 200 . Sorry guys but i think this flick really sucks . The cutting is also a incoherent thing , they jump all over the place with not so much connections . The killing scenes is not to recommend to anyone who have seen b horrors , even troma is better to scare me than this flick . What can you get out of this movie ? I think nothing because of several reasons . The mention of magic in this movie is not really what 's it is about , at least that is what i read about the esoteric and magic . Many things in this movie is incoherent and badly cut , with weird camera positions and many things that you `` need '' to get a horror flick . Not the innovating kind . " ,2
" Very Entertaining . A very fine independent movie . . I did not know what to expect when I picked up this DVD . But , I have to admit it held my attention from beginning to end ... and boy was the ending a shocker ! I do n't know if the ending will work for most , but for me it did . The music was very intense and scary as well -LRB- I had to buy the soundtrack , it 's great for Halloween -RRB- Any way , I really liked it and the special features are cool too . For me however , besides the surprise ending and the shocking murder mystery plot twists , what I love the most about this movie is the title ... BLEEDING ROSE , ooh nice :-RRB- " ,9
" An Excellent Overly ambitious Indie movie ! . First there was Spike Lee 's independent drama `` She 's Got ta Have It '' . Then came Robert Rodriguez 's indie action flick `` El Mariachi '' . Now we have Kareem Bland 's ambitious indie slasher\/drama `` Bleeding Rose '' . First let me say that this is a very very unique and interesting movie . It 's a suspense\/thriller\/mystery with elements of horror mixed in . There are a lot of dramatic elements within the film and moments that will make you jump . The ending is a real shocker . Loved it . This movie feels like a very good entertaining IFC Channel movie . Now this movie may not be for everyone . This is a very low budget movie . Or dare I say it ... ` no budget ' . As I watched the DVD 's ` behind-the-scenes ' footage it looked like the director did n't have much of a crew . There was no gaffer trucks or grip crews . It looked like a director and some friends playing around with a camera ! Yet , that 's what makes this movie so impressive ... because it 's really GOOD ! It reminds me of Roderiquez and how he made his first feature ` El Mariachi ' with no crew . Is Bland the next Roderiquez ? I would n't say that , but he did a damn good job . Very very impressive . Of course there are ` technical ' flaws . Most low budget movies have them . Yet unlike most , ` Bleeding Rose ' tales an excellent ` slightly controversial ' original story . Plus the technical flaws kinda give it an edgy style . This movie took me by surprise . The music is great too . It 's nothing like you would expect from a straight to video movie . The scores were engaging , giving the movie that extra chill . Would I recommend this ? Yes ! If only to see what can be done with so little . This is a movie for indie filmmakers first , and lovers of the ` artsy , ambitiously creative little budget movies ' second . Maybe I 'm giving this guy more credit than he deserves , but I really enjoyed it . Check it out for yourself . '10 stars ' for having the balls to make this entertainingly good film with little money and by any means necessary . Well done ! " ,10
" A Decent Thriller . Given that this was a horror film , I did not expect a long and sought out character driven story . What I got was an entertaining thriller where the characters are killed off like they typically are . The acting was decent considering the storyline . After all , it looks as if most of the actors are first timers . While there is certainly room for improvement , I had to keep in mind that it was a low budget , independent movie . This movie went straight to video and most of those movies are not the best films I have seen . I actually enjoyed Maintenance , and thought the twist at the end gave it some originality . " ,7
" A few stars for atmosphere . Having lived with only a handful of other tenants in a large building undergoing renovation in New York City -LRB- and on the same floor that Stephanie lived on -RRB- , the subject matter of this film was a little too close to home . We also had ex-cons working in our building , and we had break-ins and crimes committed by maintenance staff , though no rapes or murders . The film had a couple of mildly terrifying moments , but most of it failed to convey a sense of dread , or was original enough in its details -LRB- except for the setting , which was terrific -RRB- to be considered truly frightening . The crimes committed were a bit too abrupt . As a previous reviewer noted , there was precious little exposition that would have lent a sense of suspense and depth . And with all the good -LRB- great -RRB- unemployed actors out there , it seems a better cast could have been picked . The film had a kind of amateurish\/film-school project aura about it that was at once admirable and disconcerting . \*\*\*\*\* SPOILER \*\*\*\*\* Finally , what happened to the door leading to the outside ? It seemed to have disappeared ! Even if the writer\/director had made the choice for Paul to chain lock the exits to the street or something , it would have lent a note of believability to the final scenes . But the victims seemed content to stay inside to play a deadly game of cat and mouse with Paul , and that made it hard for me to suspend my disbelief . \*\*\*\*\* END SPOILER \*\*\*\*\* I would like to see this film rewritten , shot with higher production values , and re-released . It has a decent kernel of a plot and a superb setting -- it just needs more vibrant characterizations , some connection to the outside world to keep it from drifting too far into the realm of disbelief , and more skilled actors . Music could have been more prominent and original , too . " ,3
" Maintenance needs Maintenance . . The movie does n't build up the main characters at all , They are just presented to you . No view into the main characters life at all . Your perspective from the beginning of the film is that the Paul character is your stereotypical movie ` bad guy ' . His character lacks substance and meaning throughout the entire film . No insight into why the murders are taking place . No insight into his past , Nothing at all . He is so stereotypical that he snugs his chin into his chest before going in for the kill , A typical horror film clich . It used bleak lighting , typical music , and on top of that you have the AWFUL acting . Unfortunately the acting is so bad that it kills any originality that could have been . Maintenance completely lacks originality and substance even though the storyline could very well of worked out with a better cast of characters and better direction . " ,3
" Wooden acting . What could have been an interesting idea was spoilt by the lack of any character development . We are given no insight into why an ex-convict , freshly out of prison and having been given a new start , would throw it all away by immediately commencing random and seemingly motiveless killings within the building . Given that there were only FOUR tenants in the whole block , was n't it verging on the ridiculous to start killing them all off - what was he planning to do when they were all dead ? The ending was a slightly unexpected `` twist '' , and a minor payoff for making it through to the end this poorly acted , non-scary horror film . " ,3
" pretty good for a real low budget . The movie had some good and shocking parts , especially one which still sticks on my mind , but i wo n't give it away . I though the camera work was pretty good . The acting was OK , but a lot better than other low budget films . The story line I though was pretty original , about a murderer maintenance man who was an ex-con . The location where it was filmed i though matched the movie really well . In terms of the soundtrack , i think a bit more originality would have worked better . Or maybe some soundtrack completely different than anything we have heard before . Overall i give this film a pretty good rating given that it is a ow budget and the actors were not named actors or anything . I give this movie an 8 " ,8
" A quite bad attempt at thriller\/horror . I can watch almost all kinds of movies without any greater problems , but one of my pet peeves have always been poorly made horror movies . Some directors seem to think that this is the easiest genre out there , and that anyone can make a horror movie , but nothing could be further from the truth . Steel Trap is yet another really poor attempt at making a buck of other peoples original ideas . At first , I thought this would be something of a Saw type of movie , but it is more like a straight forward slasher . Nothing new here . The script and acting is OK at times , but those times are rare and really overshadowed by the sometimes down-right retarded decisions made by the characters . It 's really not that difficult to attract say the police or fire department to a skyscraper in the middle of a large city . If you 're bored out of your skull , I suppose this movie is better than staring at the wall or re-arranging your sock drawer , but if you 've got anything , and I do mean ANYTHING , better to do , I suggest you do that instead of watching Steel Trap .

" crap may spoil I guess if such a crappy movie can be spoiled . crap ... my fianc fell asleep ... bad acting , predictable , nothing to waste your time on . REALLY do n't waste your time or $ $ $ . Even the gore scenes are n't that gory . The main character is a wannabe Rachel Ray I guess and the end result just disgusts at the small attempt at a twist ending.LAME LAME LAME . This movie did n't even satisfy my B horror movie cravings and I can deal with even cheese with gore but they were actually serious when attempting to create a `` HORROR '' movie . The cover art does n't even have ANYthig to do with the movie . NOthing to do with the movie and technically there is NO steel trap so inaccurate title also . TOO bad it may have had potential . " ,1
" half hearted remix of classics . I watched this not knowing anything about it . I had n't heard about it and thought it might be interesting . The first few minutes were somewhat painful . Wooden acting , uninspired camera ... It was n't exactly exciting . But then : I like Cube , and that had similar problems . Then the actual story started , and from then on it went downward . It looks like someone wanted to take advantage of the success of slasher\/thriller movies like SAW and Battle Royale but just could n't think of an original idea , so mixed thriller classics , and added some blood . If you know any of the `` 10 little n \* ggers '' - based movies -LRB- sorry ... That 's the name of the original Agatha Christie book , and somehow she did n't care about being politically correct -RRB- , you 'll figure out what the ~ punch line ~ of Steel Trap is . This really just a remake of the original story , but sadly it is a very boring one . The characters are all very annoying and the story lacks any kind of suspense . The inevitable come back of the `` oh so dead '' killer at the end , the frame job ... It 's all so predictable it 's not even amusing anymore . I give it 4 out of 10 for a few nice lines and the fact that some of the girls actually look kind of nice . " ,4
" A bad horror movie . I think that a filmmaker who decides to make a slasher flick has two choices : having a lot of faith on the screenplay and to trust that he found a new perspective for making that formula interesting or making a completely mercenary film which is full of clich s for finally making a cheap movie.The crappy film Steel Trap belongs to the second style.The slasher films became popular thanks to Halloween -LRB- 1978 -RRB- and Friday the 13th and , since of that , we have seen hundred of movies with similar structures , characters and story.The details change , so every slasher movie tries to be different by using a curious location or a new mask , just to mention two examples.I do not pretend to find a lot of originality on slasher films but what I pretend to find is even the minimum effort for giving the known formula a special element , making it interesting and entertaining.Steel Trap could have chosen that difficult point but , instead of risking , director and co-screenwriter Luis C mara and co-screenwriter Gabrielle Galanter wasted that opportunity so Steel Trap is a tedious experience with an extremely weak screenplay , repulsive characters , a boring and generic killer without any personality and a forced and arbitrary ending.I usually do not like to criticize an independent film from my favorite genre but , even on some incompetent works -LRB- like Return to Sleepaway Camp -RRB- , I appreciate some energy and enthusiasm which on some way compensate some fails of the movie.But Steel Trap does not even have that.Plus , to add more negative things , C mara 's direction is completely insipid.In other words , it seems nobody involved on this movie was really interested on it.The characters are so repulsive that I was glad when the killer started to kill them.Steel Trap is a very crappy film.This is one of that movies in which I feel I really lost the time with it and that 's the worst sin a movie can make.If you wan na see a very good modern slasher flick , I recommend you the Norwegian movie Fritt Vilt.Skip Steel Trap , a very bad horror film . " ,4
" mostly lame with weak kills . this was a pretty lame horror movie in my opinion.the kills are pretty tame , even weak.i 'd say it was a Saw rip off , but it does n't even come close to that film.it 's not nearly as clever.none of the actors seem to be putting fort any effort.the dialogue is pretty lame too , in my mind at least.for most of the running time , this thing is trying to be a serious horror film , but it abruptly changes tone at the end and becomes a black comedy.ironically , the ending is the only part of the movie that works , for me anyway.i expected it to take the usual route most horror\/slasher flicks take , but it did n't so kudos to the filmmakers for that at least.still , that does little to save the movie.for me Steel Trap is a 4\/10 " ,4
" girls and boys come out to play ... . an abandoned and locked-off office building that has several guests invited to a party by their mysterious , unknown host . Only it is they who are the victims of their crimes . Suspense and mistrust are not the only stalker in this cat and mouse game of wits and fear . Who is the stalker ? Why is he killing ? And what is it exactly that everyone here has in common ? And how many times has he seen Saw ? The first thing to notice in this film , is the abominable acting . It truly is some of the worst performances i have seen , and each line that is delivered is cringe inducing . The characters are unlikeable people , and the killers outfit looks like something out of doctor who . The kills are boring , and no real effort has been made to make this film even slightly original . It 's as if they have taken the sludge from Saw 2 and tried to make something out of it , and we just get something boring , not even entertaining in the slightest . But the twist at the end is hilariously bad and almost makes up for the preceding 90 minutes . It 's not a good twist , but the rationale is funny . But not worth renting though " ,3
" Steel Trap . A New Years Party on the top of a plush abandoned building . A group of spoiled success types -LRB- . . rock singer , newspaper columnist , television exec , celebrity cook , entertainment lawyer , high-maintenance slut -RRB- find themselves trapped in the isolated wings of the abandoned building after following a riddle to a properly prepared party by a psycho . The psycho haunts the rooms , hidden behind his prey who wander aimlessly trying to survive as he captures them one by one when certain individuals make the mistake of getting separated . Booby traps await equipped with riddles . A list containing the names of the group given an invite are labeled with specific titles -LRB- Kathy-loser , Nicole-heartless , Adam-pig , etc -RRB- and when each victim is dispatched a red X is marked through them . The killer 's weapon of choice is a hook . But , other methods of execution include used an ax splitting the forehead , end of a knife stabbing a hole in the neck , a sliced throat , heart removed from a chest with it beating in the killer 's hand -LRB- . . not elaborated in grisly detail , the director uses sounds , only displaying the beating heart -RRB- , the back of a victim 's head crushed repeatedly into the floor during a scuffle , and a vicious attack with a meat tenderizer . The gore-murders lack bite and slasher fans who watch this genre passionately will find them merely adequte . This is a rather tedious slasher with a lot of the film showing this group trying to find an exit while bickering with each other . The characters like to insult each other constantly , fighting often over superficial stuff . . their antics are at times playful , other instances nasty . Regardless , the killer could n't plunge the hook into their gullets fast enough for me . . but , alas , we spend a great deal of time longer with these sleazy egomaniacs which is unfortunate . There 's of course a twist -LRB- . . does the killer have a partner in crime ? -RRB- , but `` Steel Trap '' is little more than a tired Saw retread set in a building that lacks atmosphere , no matter how often the lights blink on and off . The killer should be creepy , but he 's merely a walking kill-device whose motives for committing these acts is embarrassingly uninspired . Some slasher fans might get a kick out of who 's \* really \* behind this mind trap , as the film closes with a warped comic tone mimicking cooking shows . The riddles used in the film are corny instead of witty , leading the characters in a maze of doors and rooms with the killer knowing exactly where to strike almost at all times . " ,4
" So unlikeable , its hard to even root for them to die ... . Duped ! Yeah , totally duped ... You know Dimension Extreme has given us all some really great stuff , but they have also given us some really , really , REALLY bad stuff - Steep Trap falls into the latter . Now coming from someone who is very much into the horror genre and can usually find some shining moments in the worst of the worst gore or scare flicks , I really ca n't think of one nice thing to say about this one except for - It was so bad I laughed a few times ... But not in the way a Troma movie is so bad it made you laugh . No , no , no , Steel Trap was just really bad . At a upscale New Years party on the top of an abandoned high rise , several extremely annoying individuals are invited down a few floors to where the real party is at . The unlikable ensemble quickly find out that this is no party at all as one by one they all begin to suffer very uninventive and forgettable ends to their miserable lives . They all must play the killer 's game till the end or suffer an ill fate at the hands of a truly laughable silver masked maniac . Horror fans , do yourself a favor and skip out on this one . There are no inventive deaths , no well built suspense , no likable characters , atrocious acting - good and evil , and worst of all the dialouge is so forced it will embarrass you to no end . " ,1
" Surprisingly brilliant . I think this film is excellent . Luckily I stumbled upon it whilst scrolling through the horror channel ; I 'm very glad that I found it !! The film gripped me from the outset ; it is chilling , mysterious , creepy , and has you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film . There are a lot of similarities between this film and the Saw franchise ; but that 's fine -LRB- I 'm a huge fan of the Saw films -RRB- . Very interesting and gripping ; the characters are likable and the fear is believable , and whilst I initially thought that the twist was a bit tacky to begin with , the more it carried on the more I was pleased and surprised with how it developed . Overall an excellent film and I will definitely recommend others to watch it . " ,9

In any case , if you need a horror movie for New Year 's Eve , you could do worse than this one . It is generally enjoyable , and actually stays truer to the New Year 's Eve theme throughout the movie than Bloody New Year -LRB- 1987 -RRB- which got kind of Christmas-y in the middle . Anyway . . The movie opens on a New Year 's Eve party complete with a rock performance of Auld Lang Syne on top of an abandoned office building . 5 people 2 party-crashers who come along are diverted to a VIP party on the 27th floor by text message , where they find strange surprises waiting for them . As they split off to solve riddles , the killer starts picking them off in twisted ways . The production values are good , and personally I think the acting is not bad . The writing is kind of crap though . The initial character responses make no sense . Upon discovering place cards that insult each of them , they are too excited about digging into cake rather than being suspicious . The dialogue is frequently bad . The characters go nuts rather quickly , and the guy you now hate is clearly reaching to make you hate him , going off about everything that is too stupid to go off about . But overall the movie is enjoyable . The level of psychotic is fun . It somewhat reminds me of the 2001 movie Valentine . If you liked Valentine , you 'll probably like Steel Trap . " ,7
" An ordinary and mellow start turns into a masterpiece of its kind . This is the second part of my little review series : Movies that are way better than you expect . Steel trap seems at first sight to be another ordinary psychological thriller or slasher movie in the shadows of the great The cube , Mind Hunters and Saw . I expected a movie of a quality comparable to House of 9 or Nine dead but I was rather wrong . The movie starts with the introduction to some stereotypical and rather ordinary characters and I was already close to judge the lack of originality of this movie . When the killing game began I was positively surprised for the first time . The acting was n't that wooden and rather realistic and appropriated . The next surprise followed quickly . The killing methods turned out to be rather original , the atmosphere was sinister and gripping and the whole story attached me more to the characters . The movie got truly entertaining and addicting and I kept guessing who was behind the bloody murders and why . The great thing is that there are many wrong clues and also some right ones and I happened to analyze the behavior of each candidate and had to change my mind and opinion many times . The third and last great surprise is without a doubt the twist in the end of the movie that I did n't really see coming . Normally , I have some doubts and am able to get on the right lane but this time , I got completely bumped . This ending really rated this movie way up beyond the average slasher flick . To keep it short , this is a rather original and gripping movie of a more and more popular genre and the rating average in here is definitely way too low . The movie is entertaining and an ideal choice for any horror movie night with your mates and you will keep guessing and expecting until the very end . " ,8
" Ugly People . I agree with much of the previous stuff ... bad writing , dialog , etc. , but what I really found most shocking was how ugly the cast was . I mean ... in a horror ? Do n't you really want to see pretty people being killed , maimed , raped , tortured , etc. ... Here , it looks like they went around to all the plastic surgeons ' offices in town and took all the `` befores '' and threw them in the movie . Old ones at that . Everyone appeared to be at least in their 30s . \*\*\*\*\* Spoiler -- sort of \*\*\*\*\* That `` prettiest girl in the room '' line just killed me !!! I think it was n't as much an exclusive party as where the rest of the town hid out all the ugly people . " ,3
" Erotic , touching and beautiful . Everybody is allowed to do a job just for the money , I know that I do , but when it comes to the acting profession , I irrationally think that I expect a little bit more from our finest thespians . I do n't know why . I just do . Take , for example , the actor Ben Kingsley . Ben Kingsley sometimes annoys the hell out of me . He is one of the best actors in the world , but sometimes plys his trade in the likes of films like `` Thunderbirds '' , `` A Sound Of Thunder '' and `` The Love Guru '' . Such a waste . Such a shame . Thank God he occasionally realizes how good he is and signs up for a movie as sublime as `` Elegy '' . `` Elegy '' is a great movie . Ben Kingsley is supreme in it . He plays David Kapesh , an expat British teacher and writer . Kapesh is selfish . He is a player and a commitment phobe , who takes and drops lovers at the drop of a hat . That is until he meets Penelope Cruz 's Consuela Castillo , with whom he begins a pretty standard affair and , against all expectations , and much to his dismay , falls in love with her . `` Elegy '' has some seriously good , sure footed performances . Ben Kingsley is on Oscar worthy form . It is as different , but as good a performance , as his Oscar nominated turns in `` Sexy Beast '' and `` House Of Sand And Fog '' . Patrica Clarkson , as Kapesh 's long standing mistress , defines hurt and betrayal , Penelope Cruz completely puts word to the lie of one daft critic who said that she simply can not act in the English language , but the surprise here is Dennis Hopper : His performance as Kapesh 's best friend is light years away from the eye rolling villain that he normally portrays to make a crust . `` Elegy '' is erotic , touching and beautiful . I think that it is a cracking movie and deserves a bigger audience . " ,8
" A Monumental Cruz . Perhaps the most moving aspect of this very moving adaptation of Philip Roth 's `` The Dying Animal '' is Penelope Cruz 's extraordinary performance . Ben Kingsly is also superb but we 're kind of used to see him explore different universes with absolute ease . From `` Ghandi '' to `` Sexy Beast '' Penelope Cruz is a whole other story . From `` Volver '' to `` Vicky Cristina Barcelona '' to `` Elegy '' in rapid succession have transformed this Spanish beauty into one of the best actresses of her generation . She gets under your skin and transmits the emotional journey of her characters with a powerful strength that lasts and lingers . The truth she carries is all consuming and makes the experience totally unforgettable . Her performance alone makes `` Elegy '' a must see . " ,8
" Take a look inside . `` Elegy '' is the fifth movie Ben Kingsley has done this year and its been so good to see him back in form the last couple years cause I honestly thought that doing `` Bloodrayne '' was his way of saying `` I 'm losing my mind . '' Nicholas Meyer wrote the movie from a novel by Phillip Roth . The last time Meyer adapted something from Roth we got Anthony Hopkins playing a black guy in `` The Human Stain '' , and that was just one of many problems that that movie had . `` Elegy '' was directed by Isabel Coixet though , who I really only know from the short film `` Bastille '' , one of a group of films that can be found in the all-around beautiful love letter to Paris film , `` Paris J'Taime . '' She seems well-suited for this love story , as do Kingsley and Penelope Cruz . Only the question is , can they all make a better movie than `` The Human Stain '' ? Kingsley plays cultural critic David Kepesh , a man who spent most of the 60 's sexual revolution unfortunately married . Now a divorced college professor , Kepesh has devoted much of his after graduation activities to hitting on former students , his most recent conquest being Consuela Castillo -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- , a hard working woman from a Cuban family . Just Consuela awakens a sense of passion in him and soon he is thrown into a confusing situation where he jealously wants to have her for his own but his fear of commitment to another woman has him pushing her back when she wants to get closer . At times funny and heartbreakingly moving , this movie mostly just makes you think how lazy most men are when it comes to relationships . I found it interesting how even a cultural critic , a man who spends his life looking for deeper meaning in everything , can look at a woman and only see a sex toy . That what a woman holds inside is a short substitute for what she holds outside . David being self-conscious about his age adds another dimension , backing up that long held belief by men that women are also more concerned with what 's on the outside as well . It 's all material that has been worked over before in countless romances and the ending relies on that old romantic clich of throwing in a fatal disease that threatens the life of one of the characters but in general director Isabel Coixet creates a moving , heartfelt love story complete with sensual sex scenes , beautiful piano-background music and some really nice -LRB- and tasteful -RRB- shots of Penelope Cruz 's boobs and ass . There is also some really excellent acting going on in this movie . Kingsley charges into his role like a lion , showing David 's brashness in preying on the young girls he so dearly missed out on during his married youth , but he also brings regret , vulnerability , and cluelessness to David that make him worthy of sympathy . And Penelope Cruz could n't be better as his above-age Lolita , bringing a soft-spoken sexiness and warmth to a woman trying mightily to disarm a man primarily drawn to women as play things . And where has Dennis Hopper been ? This is one of his best performances in a long time , playing a man whose gone through the wringer a couple times with relationships himself who now offers up his own wisdom , coupled with some comic relief as well . Patricia Clarkson does what she can in a small role as an on-again off-again sex buddy for David . She has a fantastic scene in the movie later on where she describes what life is like for older women but then unfortunately the character is never seen again . `` Elegy '' does n't simmer with romance but it 's not exactly a slow-moving disaster either . It offers up some food for thought and it 's artfully created while Kingsley , Cruz , and Hopper each supply fantastic performances . If you 're interested in a May-December romance , this one fits the bill just fine for the time being . " ,7
" adaptation of the Roth novella The Dying Animal . . This is the first time that Roth has been successfully transferred to the screen . An uncompromising movie for grownups with two exquisite central performances , and some very nice supporting turns by Clarkson , Hopper and Sarsgaard . What impressed me about this movie is that it dares to be slow , dark , almost meditative . Roth 's short book does not have much plot to it , so that adapting it to the screen runs more risks than would be the case for one of his more developed novels . But the director and screenwriter make a virtue of the book 's spare narrative elements . It takes its time studying faces , glances and shadows . I will be happy if I see another movie half as good this year . " ,9
" Ben Kingsley gives another Oscar-worthy performance . ` Elegy ' is a small , yet powerful film for adults . Focusing on a relationship between a well-respected college professor -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- and his former student -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- , ` Elegy ' shows the audience a multi-faceted , complex man whose past experiences with women and his own family have dampered his ability to participate in a healthy relationship with a woman he is truly infatuated with . The film was carried by a masterful performance by Kingsley , who successfully portrayed Kepesh as a complex man with complex relationships . His desire and lust for Cruz was so emotional and real that I believed it for every second until the very end . Kingsley was able to spark empathy with the audience as a victim of numerous losses in his life : his wife , family , son , best friend , love interest -LRB- Cruz -RRB- , and most importantly , it was his loss of youth that made Kepesh the man he is when we first meet him . I truly believed his internal struggles with adapting to life as a man romantically involved with a much younger woman -LRB- 30 years his junior -RRB- . " ,9
" A female review of this stunning movie . In Elergy I see many reviewers have overlooked what this movie really speaks of , and by that also the intent of the book and writer Phillip Roth . After reading every review here I only noticed one or two that were referring in part to what I felt this film was truly about . Ben Kingsley gives one of his best performances . Every move , every look is carefully chosen to portray the depth of emotion . It did that . I have never been a fan of Penelope Cruz , yet she captivated me . Why ? Her beauty . I think what was missed and I see others question her portrayal as sexism , is that it went far deeper . Kinglsley when questioned by his friend if he ever saw beyond her `` beauty '' did not give a direct answer . She was beautiful the film was shot to make her heart wrenchingly beautiful but I also perceived that in every way he looked at her it was not simply this beauty . He was not a man that had not ever met a beautiful woman , or young student . This was not a first . To say the attraction was sexist is to simplify what occurred . For the first time in his life , he did not know what to do . He fell in love and it was far more than with just the way she looked . The film used subtle nuances , such as him watching her as she slept , or after she left picking up her hairbrush and holding it . It was easy to see that for a man who had , had many young beautiful women she was different . I read others complaining it did not show her intelligence even though we were told she was cultivated and brilliant . It was not necessary to depict that . Why do I say that ? It is clear that while she was beautiful , it was everything she did . Every time she spoke or moved . He repeats later as does she that each remembers every second in total clarity . This is a story showing one thing , the complexity of the human relationship . The complexity of love . Torn between wanting to possess her completely and to never let her leave his side ; he is conversely fighting inner turmoil . What he never had even considered possible nor comprehended the depth of its impact on his life , changed his life forever . In a internal fight with conviction that she will leave him and the age difference means one day she will wake up and decide to go , in fear from the way she makes him feel . There is no sexism here this is a story of a man who falls in love and is struggling to manage the balance between the joy of this and the anxieties . In the end we see him sabotage the relationship . This is not as some may think in the moments when he followed her in sexual jealousy ; that was a man trying to make sense of why he felt this way when living nearly his entire life no one and nothing ever touched him so deeply . The sabotage is his doubt in been able to keep her happy , his fear of losing her , his fears that it can not last , and so he ends it by at a moment when she needs him to show her his love he lets her down . The pathos is so strong . As he parks his car and calls her to say hes broken down . The internal fight rages and he has lost . He has given away the only thing he has ever loved , due to fear . He spends the next 2 years trying to forget but as he says himself who am I fooling , it has changed me forever . When she returns in an ending that they wanted to cut but Roth refused . Cruz returns and she has breast cancer . She asks him to photograph her . Says no one ever loved her body like he did , he says he ca n't believe that . Yet we know it is true , he loves her so deeply that no one else could . It is heart wrenching as he photographs her topless . After the surgery he is there when she wakes his son having found when she was been operated on . She lied about the dates . . why ? I believe it was a test would he be there this time . As the film ends she says they took her breast and now she has lost her beauty and this part speaks to all I have said above , he kisses her and holds her . In conclusion , this film if you have the depth to absorb it is heart rending . It speaks to each of us whom have lived long enough to have begun to realize the intricacies of our hearts and minds . How our pasts influence who we are and how we behave . Truly though it is a love story and love is perhaps the most complex of emotions . It is a film to watch carefully to study each movement and be caught up in the honest view of two peoples relationship with one another . It is hard to watch and not be touched or brought to tears . Overall the acting was superb , cinematography , and direction too . I think this will remain an underrated film that contains deeper meanings that many will miss , it will however remain one that I will not forget anytime soon . As others have said , this film will appeal more to the European audience . " ,8
" The Biggest Surprise in a Man 's Life Is Old Age . In Manhattan , the middle-aged writer , art critic and professor and aspirant piano player and photographer David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- questions that his age does not affect his sex drive and recalls words of Bette Davis -LRB- `` Old age is not for sissies '' -RRB- and Tostoi -LRB- `` The biggest surprise in a man 's life is old age '' -RRB- . Despite of his great culture , the intellectual David is a man that has grown old but never grown up , and he is unable to last a relationship , including with his oncologist son Kenneth Kepesh -LRB- Peter Sarsgaard -RRB- . The exceptions are his old poet friend and confident George O'Hearn -LRB- Dennis Hopper -RRB- and the independent businesswoman Carolyn -LRB- Patricia Clarkson -RRB- , with whom he has an affair for more than twenty years . When he meets the elegant , educated and gorgeous Cuban student Consuela Castillo -LRB- Pen lope Cruz -RRB- in his literature class , he feels a great sexual attraction for her and seduces her in the end of the period . They have a love affair for one and half years , but David is always insecure being thirty and something years older than the student . When Consuela forces David to come to her graduation party and meet her family and friends , he takes a decision that affects their relationship forever . The Spanish Isabel Coixet is certainly one of the most sensitive directors of the cinema industry . `` My Life without Me '' and `` The Secret Life of Words '' are among the most beautiful , touching and heartbreaking movies I have ever seen . `` Elegy '' is another wonderful movie of this awesome director that deals with another real theme , the aging of men , which could be difficult for a female director to understand and correctly disclose on the screen . However , the romance works mainly because the lead male role seems to be tailored for Sir Ben Kingsley -LRB- it could be Sean Connery a couple of years ago -RRB- . I can not imagine any other actor that could personify David Kepesh as portrayed in the story . Further , Pen lope Cruz deserved the Oscar for her performance , with a more realistic character than in `` Vicky Cristina Barcelona '' . The Academy wrote right through wrong performances . She is incredibly gorgeous in the role of Consuela Castillo . The always excellent Patricia Clarkson , the irregular Dennis Hopper and the `` disappeared '' Peter Sarsgaard have also memorable performances in this outstanding romance . The cinematography and the music score complete this beautiful work of art . My vote is eight . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : `` Fatal '' -LRB- `` Fatal '' -RRB- " ,8
" Great performances , great film . I thoroughly enjoyed this film . As someone who is not familiar with Philip Roth 's works , I found the story to be interesting and moving . What really made the movie so enjoyable to me was the focus on the interpersonal relationships between David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- and several of the supporting players . For example , some of the film 's most poignant moments came in the scenes featuring Kepesh and his best friend -LRB- played by Dennis Hopper . -RRB- While these scenes did not necessarily serve to move the plot along , they painted a picture of the daily struggles Kepesh faces and also the layers of his only true friendship . In addition , it was heart-wrenching to see Kepeshs ' son -LRB- Peter Sarsgaard -RRB- , now a 40-something man married with children , resorting to his father for advice and consolation . We found out that Kepesh left his son and wife many years past , and while his son has never truly forgiven his father , he finds himself committing similar mistakes -LRB- adultery -RRB- that lead his father to become the flawed , relationship-challenged man he is today . These complex relationships , in addition to several others in the film , allow us to closely examine this fascinating point in the life of David Kepesh . " ,9
" A Moving Ben Kingsley Conduit Stolen By Penelope Cruz . Ben Kingsley , who is capable of playing practically any role , seems to be remarkable at playing men who are very smart but their thoughts are a lot less than pure most of the time . Elegy is a film that could easily have been written with him in mind , though by the time it 's over , Penelope Cruz has stolen away with it , and changed Kingsley 's character in the progression . It 's properly made . Kingsley seems to be just about the entire movie as a self-seeking book critic . He was married in the past , and has a well-to-do son . He got divorced years ago and has a sex pal relationship with another woman who he sees rarely , played by Patricia Clarkson , who I can totally see having the capability for no-strings occasional liaisons . He is frequently attracted to his female students , and sometimes has sex with some of them . Still , to steer clear of trouble , he always waits until they graduate . With one of these women , Penelope Cruz 's character , a more profound relationship grows . But Kingsley has never matured in this manner . He is preoccupied with jealousy , certain that she is seeing someone else , someone younger , more handsome and virile . He even shows up at a dance he knows she 's attending , to check up on her . His doubt frustrates and deters her , because she can not put up with not being trusted . When the time comes , the movie makes a dramatic bend which surrounds all the deepest bona fide feelings of the story . And in these scenes , Cruz is peacefully compelling and dreadfully real . You come to appreciate why the director , Isabel Coixet , cast Cruz rather than a younger , authentically college-age actress . An actress necessitates wisdom and the familiarity of time to play these scenes , and Cruz must have both , especially now that I 'm seeing her shortly after her incredible performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona . That this nuanced drama with erudite cultural ambiance is not merely a self-indulgent male writer 's wet dream about the horny scoundrel and the exquisite and charming Venus is a relief . That it sees Manhattan plainly as a location benefits this story because it is a place where we suppose things like this are liable to take place , not like the typical burgh where we live . Then there is Dennis Hopper as the old comrade with whom Kingsley has coffee and plays racquetball , who tries to bring wisdom to Kingsley 's activities , but sees no light at the end of the tunnel . And Peter Sarsgaard as Kingsley 's son , with problems of his own , and a father who has become not only a shame but an unrelated matter . But what the movie 's not afraid to do is let you in on Kingsley 's feelings after awhile . Who cares about all these things he should accept as responsibility when he 's so immersed in love for this new , young person ? " ,8
" Aging . OK . Professor starts an affair with one of his students . You may have prejudices about that . Not about this kind of affairs , but about this kind of movies . But it 's a story about aging and jealousy and so far touching . The professor goes through hell , including all objections he 's supposed to have about his own behavior in this certainly true love . A love which is regarded as ridiculous . Most so by himself . Cruz and Kingsley are great as you could expect , but the greatest performance is delivered by Dennis Hopper . A certain amount of sentimentality is a little disturbing , but this film obviously takes aging as an emotional problem seriously . " ,7
" Unbelievable . This movie starts out promising - a professor whose career and personal life are driven by his fascination with the hedonistic side of American sexuality confronts the one thing that will put an end to his pursuits : he 's getting old . Unfortunately , once the meat of the story gets going , it becomes a puppet show of superficial characters prancing out the whims of the screenwriter and director . Nothing about this movie is authentic , and as a result it 's pretty difficult to pay much attention to the intended themes . A 112 minute close-up of Ben Kingsley 's wrinkled face would say more about mortality and the human condition , and would say it more sincerely for that matter , not to mention more entertainingly . The characters are eggshell thin , and mostly we have to believe what we are told about them by their screen-mates , because their own behavior makes little sense . David Kapesh is a playboy ? Really ? Maybe he 's been charming in every other moment of his life , but during the time he spends with Consuela , and unfortunately with us , he 's a bumbling jackass . His hear-to-hearts with his buddy George suggest he 's incredibly insecure in the presence of a beautiful young woman , and every single encounter he has with Consuela confirms that . Is this the first time he 's dated one of his students ? No , says the film 's back story , he 's a playboy , we swear he 's a playboy . Just not since he started looking like a late-career Ben Kingsley and started acting like an @ $ $ hole I guess . So let 's just give this movie the benefit of the doubt and assume that he is and always has been a playboy we 're just not catching him on his good days . What is his special attraction to Consuela ? Okay so she 's young , educated , and beautiful . The first two attributes should apply to a good portion of the women he 's been dating his students , that is and as for the third , if he 's the playboy we 're meant to believe he is , this should be nothing new either . I 'm not saying a lady 's man ca n't be struck dumb now and again , but we 've got to have some since of why that would be the case . Instead we 're just asked to accept it . Consuela meanwhile leaves us even less in the way of authenticity and depth . First of all , that accent is sexy , do n't get me wrong , but are we really supposed to believe that a well-educated 24 year-old who 's been in the U.S. since she was 11 still talks like that ? Her family background suggests she probably did n't spend the last decade living in a ghetto , the only excuse she would have for not speaking standard American English by now . And why is she in love with David ? He 's not particularly witty , especially for a professor , and he does really annoying things like show up uninvited to spy on her while she 's out with her brother and then cover it with a lame excuse . Is it because he 's cultured ? I have a feeling that a beautiful , smart woman like her could find a comparably sophisticated man who 's within three decades of her age and who does n't act like a total creep living in NEW YORK CITY . In fact she probably would n't even have to leave campus . The only reason she could possibly want him is his status , and we 're meant to believe there 's more to her than that . Otherwise why do we care about her ? Why does David care about her ? Why does she act like she wants something meaningful from him when he clearly is willing to give her a nice sexy superficial relationship with all the trimmings of a celebrity academic 's lifestyle ? I could go on about the various other terrible aspects of this movie but this review is getting long and I 'm tired of thinking about it . Oh wait there 's one more thing that I just ca n't let go without mentioning : Consuela has a breast removed and not a single family member or friend is there ? Why not ? They must have all stayed at home when they realized how touching it would be for her to wake up from a mastectomy to find no one there to console her but a disgusting ex-boyfriend . Just one more slap in the face in a long line of scenes that insult our intelligence and artistic sensibilities alike . " ,2
" Quite a dreary and dull affair . Slow . Lifeless . Joyless . Passionless . Boring . Am I leaving anything out ? Oh , where to start the post-mortem on this one ? Well , one could begin with Sir Ben Kingsley . If ever there was a less-interesting , passionless performer , I 've never heard of him . Good actor ? Absolutely . But not for this part -- he never should have been cast . Obsessed by his young student ? I do n't see it . He waxes poetic about her body , then never even touches her breasts . He claims to love her ... yet he seems half-asleep . Maybe it had something to do with that transorbital lobotomy a while back -- that might explain the baldness . Does he ever even SMILE at her ? Does he even seem to CARE ?? If you turned the sound off , and could n't hear the lame dialogue , you might think he detested her instead . I think the only look of happiness on his face was a stupid , s \*\* t-eating grin , when he inexplicably shows up at a dance club to observe her . And from that point on he seems so pussy-whipped that we lose all respect for him anyway . It 's almost as if Kingsley was emulating Brando in `` Last Tango in Paris . '' But that was a different movie , about a much different relationship . For an audience to care about a movie like this , the characters have to care about each other . They at least have to appear alive . In this case , they are n't , and we do n't . Where are William Holden and Kay Lenz when we need them ? And what possible reason would a beautiful creature like Penelope Cruz have for falling prey to a bald , geriatric college professor ? Because he 's a wise old man ? Because he 's on TV ? Because she needs a father figure ? We 're never given a clue into what makes her tick -- that 's the problem . It 's a superficial relationship at best . One actually longs for the Jeremy Irons remake of `` Lolita . '' And at least Clint Eastwood 's `` Breezy '' had moments of lightness . And it had Bill Holden . This does n't . There 's a reason we 've never heard of the director : she 's of the glacially paced , cinema verite , documentary\/neo-realist European variety -- probably lesbian -- who considers emotion as dirty a word as characterization . Dennis Hopper almost saves the day -- he 's the only alive thing in this dud -- and then he dies ! What a treat for the audience . And what an ill-advised , pointless and unnecessary plot point . Who green-lighted this script ? And do n't try to tell me the great Nicholas Meyer actually wrote it . Meyer , of the classic `` Star Trek 2 : Wrath of Khan '' and `` Time After Time '' ??? He must be on massive doses of Prozac these days . Or maybe he 's the one who underwent the lobotomy . And do n't try to convince me this lackluster snorefest was once a Philip Roth novel . The great and hilarious Philip Roth , of `` Portnoy 's Complaint '' and `` Goodbye Columbus '' ????? `` Dying Animal '' is right . The book must have been written in his `` Human Stain '' period , after he lost his sense of humor . Well , at least this dead-on-arrival adaptation does n't break the streak : a good movie has never been made from a Roth novel . And probably never will . I 'm giving two stars here , strictly in honor of Penelope Cruz 's tits , which we see several times , thankfully -- though they 're obviously not photographed by anyone who seems to care . And if we saw her ass just ONCE -- which we do n't -- I might have given it a 3 . And I 'm not even going to get into the melodramatic plot twist at the end . If the director finally decided to go for some kind of drama , it was too little , too late . Nobody really cares about a tacked-on movie tragedy after two hours of monotony . All the characters could have been killed in a terrorist bombing and the audience probably would n't have really minded . Actually , that might have made a decent ending -- at least it would have woken people up . Or better still , kill them off in the first act , and put them out of their misery . Either way , senseless violence would have been preferable to another brain-dead , heartless , monotonous line reading -LRB- Dennis Hopper , as I say , is the one exception : he gives a funny , passionate , inspired performance -RRB- . On a technical level , there are also an incredible number of annoying , shaky , hand-held shots that serve absolutely no purpose , other than to distract . Could n't the producer afford a tripod that day ? Wait , do n't tell me -- the director thought it was `` art . '' Welcome to European , no-talent , amateur-hour hell . Close the door on the way in . And watch the flames . " ,2
" A Non-Believable Casting of Leads . Not for one moment in the entire run of this film did I believe that Cruz and Kingsley 's characters had any attraction to each other . A great deal of this starts in the fact that , as one friend of mine put it , `` Kingsley has all the sex appeal of a pickle . '' Cruz puts in a rather languid performance which is stronger than most of her acting due to the fact she is working with a Spanish -LRB- specifically , Catalan -RRB- director . But she falls flat on the screen anytime she 's there . She a very pretty woman , but as an actress , she consistently sub-par . The only redeeming scenes of the film are with Dennis Hopper and Kingsley where Cruz is n't present . These two old actors have a wonderful charisma on the screen and I would posit that it is one of Hopper 's best performances of his career . It just goes to show that Coixet can indeed get great performances out of actors as long as they 're not Penelope Cruz . It was a tricky story to adapt and in general the plot is slow and meandering . The film fails in the end in that it presents characters that 99.9 % of us ca n't relate to and does n't ever really make us care what happens to them in the end . Undoubtedly this film will be well-received in NYC where these types of films seem to ply well to a sympathetic audience , but for those of us outside the Big Apple , it 's just short of being an extremely painful film to watch . I need to add that I first saw this in Madrid when it opened in Spain . There may have been some edits to the film upon US release that made it more tolerable , although I doubt how they would have been achieved . " ,4
" a sad movie . The more I think about this movie , the sadder I find it . To begin with , it is yet another Hollywood presentation of a middle-aged male college professor -LRB- Smart People , etc. , are others of late -RRB- . Once again , he is an unhappy and self-centered individual , who clearly earns more than any professor of literature I know . He also throws cocktail parties for his students , which would send most modern college administrators into fits . But the truly sad thing about this movie is the presentation of the young woman , played by Pen lope Cruz , and her relationship with the professor . Yes , she is very attractive . Yes , he wants to have sex with her and is only interested in that . But she is getting an MFA , he has an apartment full of art books , yet we never see her talk to him about art , her necessarily educated and refined ideas on art , etc. . When , at the end of the movie , she learns that she has breast cancer and then loses a breast in the operation , she is devastated because she will no longer be beautiful and he will no longer desire her . Her physical beauty and her attractiveness to men seem to be her whole world , and this is not put into question . And yet the movie was directed by a woman . Even from a good male director I would have expected some putting into question of those values , but with a woman director and an educated character , the lack of it particularly bothered me . If this movie was condemned by a breast cancer association , I would understand . There is n't really much intellectual substance to the professor 's life , either . He and his colleague , another literature professor , seem to talk only about having sex . That would be a normal part of their conversation , of course , but we never see why the lit professor is esteemed for his mind , as he would appear to be . I have n't read the Phillip Roth novel on which this is based . Maybe all this is there , maybe not . But the movie has to be judged on its own grounds , of course , and while I found this well acted , I found the script to be sadly lacking . Such supposedly intelligent , educated individuals could have been a lot more interesting . " ,7
" Dignity and Sensuality : Intoxication . ` When you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life . ' Few American writers have been able to examine the fear and rage and desperation of aging as eloquently as Philip Roth , and as with another of his novels brought to life on the screen -LRB- ` The Human Stain ' -RRB- , here Nicholas Meyer has beautifully adapted Roth 's ` The Dying Animal ' with all the visceral immediacy and poetry of the novel about the terror and compassion of May\/December relationships . Isabel Coixnet has managed to guide her gifted set of actors through this story as though it were a ballet . The result is one of the more beautiful ` love stories ' ever filmed . David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley , in a performance of tremendous power and sensitivity -RRB- is an aging author , teacher and art critic , a man who has not learned the secret of lasting relationships but who retains his animal sex drive despite his passing years : he survives time 's passing by a patterned assignation with Carolyn -LRB- Patricia Clarkson -RRB- , an aging successful traveling business woman who drops in for sensual gratification when in town . David 's closest friend is Pulitzer prize winning poet George O'Hearn -LRB- Dennis Hopper -RRB- who serves as his alter ego and as his confidant in David 's problematic life . Into David 's classroom comes Consuela Castillo -LRB- the ravishingly beautiful and gifted Pen lope Cruz -RRB- who gains David 's focus not only for her radiant beauty but also for her intelligence . Struggling with his advanced years -LRB- David is over thirty years older than Consuela -RRB- , a courtship dance begins and it is the emergence of this romance that forms the story . How Consuela alters David 's behavior and his discovery of the need for connection outside of the bedroom is related as a journey through David 's mind . The manner in which the transformation changes every member of the story is what makes this film so very memorable . Kingsley is brilliant in this probing examination of the aging man 's psyche , Cruz SHOULD have received her Oscar for this performance rather than the film that honored her , Clarkson continues to be one of our best actresses on the screen , Peter Sarsgaard makes a brief but important appearance , and David Hopper manages to step out of his predictable past roles and offer a character of true compassion and finesse . The film is magnificently photographed -LRB- Jean-Claude Larrieu -RRB- and the music score thankfully is almost completely devoted to the works of Erik Satie -LRB- Gnossiennes -RRB- , Beethoven -LRB- Diabelli Variations -RRB- , Vivaldi -LRB- cantatas with Phillipe Jaroussky -RRB- - all edited by the director Isabel Coixnet . It all works well . This is one of the finer films of 2008 and deserves a wide audience of people who love quality film-making . Grady Harp " ,10
" Elegy . George O'Hearn : `` Beautiful women are invisible ; we 're so dazzled by the outside that we never make it inside . '' Charismatic professor David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- glories in the pursuit of adventurous female students but never lets any woman get too close . When gorgeous Consuela Castillo -LRB- Pen lope Cruz -RRB- enters his classroom , however , his protective veneer dissolves . Her raven-haired beauty both captivates and unsettles him . Even if Kepesh declares her body a perfect work of art , Consuela is more than an object of desire . She has a strong sense of herself and an emotional intensity that challenges his preconceptions . Kepesh 's need for Consuela becomes an obsession , but ultimately his jealous fantasies of betrayal drive her away . Shattered , Kepesh faces up to the ravages of time , immersing himself in work and confronting the loss of old friends . Then , two years later , Consuela comes back into his life?with an urgent , desperate request that will change everything . Elegy is an excellent film . I 've been never really a fan of Ben Kingsley but I 've seen him in numerous films before but I just did n't stick with his movie career . But now , with Elegy , I can say that I 'm already a fan of his . Ben 's performance is one for the books , it was powerful , intense and the chemistry between him and Penelope Cruz 's Consuela is surprisingly amazing . The character development between the two is told in a touching , beautiful way by director Isabel Coixet and I 'd like to think that what they had is more than a carnal affair . It was a romantic friendship and they were there for each other in times of dire need . Penelope Cruz gives the best performance yet whose acting slate also includes heavy set dramas like Volver and Vicky Cristina Barcelona . This easily makes her one of the best actresses of her generation . Elegy is an erotic tale with a sense of beauty and brilliance . A must see . " ,8
" Penelope Cruz Fans This Movie Does Not Exist . if Penelope Cruz ever lost some fans it because of this film elegy this film is pure junk see the plot now Ben Kingsley an old man who loves sex chases young women lays his eyes on hot student the story then gets extended then sex scenes comes with Penelope showing her naked breasts like some wwe wrestler then comes some gross kissing more insult for the viewers he is having all that in someone Else 's house . i am embarrassed to write a review here this is some shameless.please throw the team into jail for this porn film.as a Cruz fan i am not disappointed because it her style to be sexy in her most career she did films that promotes sexual vulgar stuff.don blame her at all she needed some serious money . Ben is the worst actor ever old guy cant act loves to have sexy only . so for die hard Penelope fans around the world ill tell you this movie does not exist just pretend to believe it . my rating is 1\/10 . these guys should hang their heads in shame " ,1
" Awful movie . One of the worst movies I 've ever watched . Other than Kingsley 's performance , acting , directing , filming , and most other aspects of the film are amateur to say the least . For example , in one scene -LRB- close to the end of the movie -RRB- you clearly see the hanging microphone used to tape the actors . The plot is superficial , photography is very bad , even the sound is too law and most speech could not be understood , especially as the 2 main characters have heavy accent . It is sad to see that such good actors and crew members have produced such a mediocre product . In a single word : A TERRIBLE movie . " ,1
" Careful direction , skilled acting , and excellent use of nonverbal communication puts ` Elegy ' a cut above the rest . . ` Elegy ' stood out to me not only because of its world-class acting performances -LRB- which really were the cornerstone of the film -RRB- , but also because of several technical aspects that are so effortless and natural , you hardly recognize them as results of a filmmaker 's input . Every stare , look , and glance that David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- gives is deep , carefully manufactured , and serves as another means of storytelling beyond simply words . Extended close-ups and other scenic shots are sprinkled throughout the film to make it , at points , visually beautiful as well . It is a rarity to see a film that -LRB- successfully -RRB- focuses so much on gestures , body language , and imagery , while at the same time leaving the audience with Oscar-caliber performances by some of the most celebrated screen actors today . ` Elegy ' is a triumphant effort under Isabel Coixet 's careful direction . " ,10
" Very sweet , sad and romantic ... . ... though somewhat unbelievable . Ben Kingsley 's character falls in love\/lust with his much-younger student , played by Penelope Cruz . He plays the conquering professor well , his motives are palpable and his virility and attractiveness are well portrayed . It 's understandable that he attracts women , and that one ultimately falls in love with him . I wonder if Penelope Cruz 's character was meant to be a cipher ; beyond her beauty , I could n't determine what attracted him to her . It was inferred that she was intelligent , but I did n't detect anything else that would attract him so strongly . I felt the chemistry from him , not much from her . This criticism is minor because the film was beautifully acted and filmed . In his myriad roles , Ben Kingsley plays different characters from Gandhi to Sexy Beast to a man who betrays the woman he loves , and ultimately loses . He continually exceeds expectations . " ,8
" It is a good movie but read the book afterwards ! . I have read the book this film is based on back in 2004 and one more time in 2006 , and I still cherish it as one of the best books I have ever read . Therefore , watching this film was a sort of duty . What I disliked was that in the first half , Professor Kepesh gets to know Consuela way too fast . He invites all his students to his home , and soon he is in the cahoots with Consuela . Of course I am aware that I 'm comparing the novel to the film but still I ca n't avoid that . In the novel , David Kepesh explains much about his sexual philosophy , something that could have been the basis for a much longer , more elaborated film . In the novel , there are philosophical excursions into American culture , puritanism and sexual freedom , things that in the film are rarely touched . For this film you could even call `` romantic movie '' -LRB- I recommend it to lovers ! -RRB- , the portrayal of the unequal relationship between Kepesh and Consuela was too tame . In the novel you see and sense that Kepesh has no bounds . In sexuality and relationships , he is all but committed to somebody he boasts his emancipation and freedom . The novel Kepesh even explores some rather unusual sexual practices with Consuela . As an avid reader of Roth 's novels , I was really a bit disappointed . Some commentators have stated that this film is misogynistic because Kepesh is shown using Consuela as his sexual tool . He is n't much interested in building trust . But in the end , the film shows Kepesh 's destruction : We see him punished . We see his anguish . Philip Roth 's novels argue against a hollow sexual morale which is evident in slogans like `` True love waits '' . Sex is something good , something you are completely free to enjoy . But what Roth shows is the emotional loss that often follows when one does act selfishly and without integrity . Kepesh , a grown and experienced man who could have stood up to Consuela , tries out his sexual philosophy on the very person that is so dear to him . In German-language countries , the film is called `` Elegy - the art of loving '' not without reason . Go , watch it ! " ,8
" It grabbed me by the throat . As soon as this movie came out here , I ran to see it ! It grabbed me by the throat ... I loved everything about it ! : the theme , the direction , the camera-work , the editing , the score , the art direction , the superb ! performances ... Just not the melodramatic end , which was totally unnecessary -LRB- although it was in the book , I wonder if the director had the choice to leave it out , or if Philip Roth objected -RRB- . The deep tragedy of the inability to reach the person you love s much and how one can ruin everything because of unjustified jealousy , suspicion and fear of commitment is intense enough . It breaks your heart to see that love is n't recognized , that fear , pride and ego sabotage what could have been a happy relationship ... I identified with David as well as with Consuela . This movie really broke down the waterworks . It took me hours to get myself together - and I still feel wobbly . -RRB- ... After I left the cinema , I immediately ran to the nearest bookstore and grabbed the last book from the shelf ... " ,9
" Touching . Brilliant . Erotic . The best film in a long time . . I ca n't say anything else now , that I have finished watching ELEGY just 15 minutes ago , than this : it has been the most truthful , enchanting , sensual , witty , beautiful yet at the same time hurting and dangerously close experience of storytelling I have put myself through in a long time . To miss this film means to miss a masterfully told story of love , trust , courage , age - both young and old - and most of all , of `` becoming '' , of time that starts going faster and faster the more we grow old . Extraordinary . Period . " ,10
" This film is not designed for anyone under age 40 ... . Stunning film , about a man who finally `` gets it . '' Years and years of self-indulgence ... gone . Years of not knowing the pain he caused , could also be felt . Did his own mortality trigger it ? Does n't it ... in every male ? Great psychological study of having-it-all vs. really having `` it . '' Ben Kingsley does a superb job of staying calm and letting his eyes do the work , discretion instead of `` chewing-the-scenery . '' Dennis Hopper is well-cast as his confidant who did n't really know him . Penelope Cruz reminds one of a young Sophia Loren , but was difficult to understand in the `` quiet '' parts . Deborah Harry , excellent as the `` long-time '' bed-buddy . Peter Sarsgard as the long-suffering duplicate son ... all these folks brought brilliance . Pity the U.S. version was cut to shreds ... would have liked to see the `` director 's cut '' on this one . " ,10
" Disappointing . I had been looking forward to seeing this film for about a month after I saw an interview with Ben Kingsley talking about it . I was very disappointed . I found it slow , pretentious and really flat . I thought the two main characters were vain , shallow and unlikeable . Penelope Cruz 's performance was far better than Ben Kingsley 's but was nowhere near her usual standards , such as Volver . She has much greater ability than was displayed here . The background music was labored and intrusive . All in all I found it horridly contrived and I had to keep looking at my watch to see how much longer I had to suffer it before it ended . " ,2
" What an uninteresting and manipulative plot ! . Through most of this movie , I was bored to death . It tells the story of a middle-aged man who wo n't grow up and has some affairs with his students and then he falls in love . And that is basically it . Told for unbearable 2 hours or so . I must add that I love Ben Kingsley as an actor , but tend to not find Penelope Cruz especially interesting in her performances . Her character in this movie is pretty dull -LRB- no surprise there then -RRB- , she is being portrayed as the beauty who is also profound -LRB- well , that 's maybe a matter of taste , but I really do n't find her that beautiful , and certainly the character was said to be profound , but it was not shown -RRB- . Please . Give me a break . Just when I was about to almost leave the theater , the movie gets a dramatic turn by Cruz ' character having cancer . I am actually angry because of this movie . I do have a case of cancer in my family , so I am familiar with the subject , thanks very much . But a movie that has basically no substance at all -LRB- and just claims to be sophisticated , using all sorts of clich s etc -RRB- and then throws in the dramatic element of a terminal illness to make it a good movie ? I find this manipulative and sorry , her character does not become interesting by having cancer . There is little character development -LRB- maybe mostly for Ben Kingsley 's role -RRB- , but the subject of people reaching middle age and not wanting to grow up is just dead boring to me . He wo n't commit , yet he is in love with her and never forgets her , whilst she loves him too , but leaves him due to lack of commitment , and then she reappears , telling him she has cancer . And he bursts into tears -LRB- actually the best moment , Kingsley is very credible here -RRB- , and is at her side to support her . Add to all of this an even more dull son who appears somewhere in the middle of this painfully bad plot , wanting to talk to his father -LRB- and we are already informed that they do n't have the best relationship with each other -RRB- . He has an affair ! As a married man ! Oh My God ! And it is so very bad acted , that I actually felt in every second of that scene `` he is acting ! he is acting ! this is a movie ! this is so not credible '' . I am sure this was not the intended reaction for the audience . So , all in all , let me summarize that I still feel this is a mainly uninteresting , dull , boring movie that has nothing new or really profound to tell , and that misuses the element of cancer -LRB- or any serious illness , for that matter -RRB- for its dramatic effect on the audience . I felt betrayed by this sort of emotional manipulation . I give 3 points because Kingsley 's performance was - as usual - excellent . A bad movie remains a bad movie though , even if you add cancer to it . An uninteresting , not deeply explored character that is the so-called sophisticated lady -LRB- wishful thinking here ! -RRB- does not become incredibly interesting just because she is going to die soon . Give me a break ! " ,3
" Is this movie over yet ? Can I go now ? . A sepia-toned soporific bore , Elegy is an insult to every older man who enjoyed his relationship with a younger woman . Heinously miscast as a playboy professor , Ben Kingsley is far too stiff , depressed and stiff-backed for the part . This is a character tailor-made for Jeremy Irons or perhaps John Malkovich , someone with wit and movement . In one scene where he is moodily staring out his rain-flecked apartment window , his posture is less like a man contemplating mortality than someone pondering the sewage system of his street . It 's virtually impossible to imagine Kingsley 's character , David Kapesh , pursuing anything sexual . And the scenes where he nuzzles lover Penelope Cruz are cringe-inducing . The film only comes to life in the brief , male bonding scenes with Dennis Hopper . I 've not been a fan of Penelope Cruz until recently . But with her work in Vicki Christina Barcelona and this warm , sensual , intelligent and open performance in Elegy , I 'm a fan now . Hopper is lively and fun , even if his character is a slightly mean-spirited fount of bad advice . Patricia Clarkson is lovely and expressive in her brief scenes , too . Avoid ! " ,1
" How can you enjoy Rambo IV and Elegy in the same year ? . I think it is strange how your film palette changes over the years . When I was fifteen , films like Rambo , Terminator and Porky 's were the only films I enjoyed . I would of never understood a film like Elegy and I probably would have despised it . But when you are 36 and now have a family and a house and a career , you understand more and you certainly `` get '' characters like David Kapesh . If you ca n't empathize or at least understand where Kapesh is coming from in the film , then perhaps it 's not a film you should bother with . David Kapesh , played exquisitely by Ben Kingsley , is an aging , divorced professor who looks for the next female student to seduce . To stay out of trouble , he waits until his class is over and the grades are handed out and then he has a party for everyone where he zeroes in on the student . He proceeds to show them how cultured he is by reading the poetry and showing them his art collection . It seems to work on most but then he meets Consuela , played with an Oscar worthy Penelope Cruz . She is seduced by him but she allows herself to be . She is enamoured with him but she seems to be one step ahead of the game . He falls for her and they begin a romance that he is convinced will end badly for him as she is young , beautiful and desired by most men that she meets . She is also 30 years younger than him . But they click somehow and they seem to truly love each other . There is also a sub plot about Kanesh 's son who he feels alienated from as he walked out on his mom years ago . Also , his best friend , played brilliantly by Dennis Hopper , is the insightful one in the film and comes up with the best line . `` Beautiful women are invisible ; we 're so dazzled by the outside that we never make it inside . '' The film is full of all kinds of insight and although you may not like all of the characters and what they do and what they say , they are honest . Brutally honest is Kapesh . He knows he is a bastard , but he feels honesty is paramount in life . It 's why he left his wife all those years ago and it 's why he has a hard time being committal all these years later . Elegy has one of the better scripts in film this year . It is insightful , melancholy , bittersweet and honest all at the same time . Kapesh has lived enough to not really care what others think of him all the time and that includes his son who comes to him with some of his problems . In fact , infidelity seems to be a very big plot piece in the film as everyone seems to be sleeping with someone that they should n't be . This is what creates both happiness and misery in the film . Marriage , infidelity and sex are some of the main themes . I think being older can allow you to appreciate the film much more . When you can laugh at jokes about marriage being a prison and when you can relate to older men still hoping they look somewhat attractive to younger women , I do n't think those are the kinds of jokes that teens would laugh at . Elegy is a bittersweet film and I highly recommend it . I hope Kingsley , Cruz and Hopper all get some Oscar consideration . 9\/10 " ,9
" The lessons of commitment and love = an ELEGY . Another brilliant acting turn by Ben Kingsley in this beautifully photographed film set in New York with a superb cast of Patricia Clarkson , Penelope Cruz , Dennis Hopper and Peter Sarsgaard , in a story which deals with human emotions and the pain of losing out on the true meaning of commitment and love . The elegance of the sets , the camera close ups of the characters , the beautiful music in the film , all bring to ELEGY a story that seems timeless in its telling . Each actor brings to ELEGY a skilled performance that is just such a joy to watch with an intelligence , sense of humor and the meaning of life 's evolution and the aging factor . Dennis Hopper was really a stand out in the film , and his journey , along with that of Penelope Cruz , makes a statement that brings ELEGY to a conclusion that is both poignant and memorable for an audience to take home and long remember after leaving the theater . " ,8
" Fantastic character movie . Definitely a great , interesting turn by all the actors involved . Ben Kingsley does great , subtle work as a professor who ca n't quite grow up while he 's growing old . He 's got great ticks that really bring the character to life . Penelope Cruz is , naturally , a perfectly reasonable object of lust and love and she brings the movie to a nice center . However , the best of all was Dennis Hopper who , even in his small role , is so hilarious and interesting that you wish he was around more . The movie really works as a sort of long episode of Ben Kingsley 's life ; it 's broken up into different parts each with their own arc that sometimes has a riveting climax while others just peter out . Not in a bad way , mind you , but like how these things happen in real life . Definitely worth seeing " ,8
" Solid and cinematographically beautiful . . The film is a bildungsroman , of sorts , about David 's -LRB- Kingsley -RRB- maturing consciousness of what he really believes and consequently , who he really is . Consuela -LRB- Cruz -RRB- is the `` catalyst '' to this process . The film was clearly directed by a European , so the pace and bouts of silence may unsettle the sensibilities of the American audience . If you could look beyond that , and the fact that the film is , indeed , a character based plot and not a story based plot , then on these merits , the film is actually quite good . However , if you look for a story driven plot with a brisk cadence , then this film will most likely be a disappointment . Here is a tongue-in-cheek rating : For Europeans : 8\/10 For Americans : 5\/10 \* give or take a point for each . Finally , the cinematography is quite good . The way it was filmed hearkens to a photographic style . There are a number of frames that could easily be converted into a photograph , complete with bokeh and all . Visually pleasing . " ,8
" Elegant and eventually wise . When a film offers some good quotes and\/or insights concerning how we live our lives it is for me always worth the ticket , and Elegy offers plenty . It is definitely not for the entertainment junkie , but it is nicely paced and keeps the intellect awake for the duration of the experience . Ben Kingsley is an art and literature professor who still has not grown up , and this is mainly represented by him not being able to have a committed adult relationship , his jealousy , and the fact that he still holds a silly , bitter grudge against his son . It is a film about what growing up means , but also the possible pain and loneliness growing old . " ,7
" elegiac in tone and execution , . What Coixet achieves here , with the aid of some fine individual and ensemble performances , is a mood piece that fully lives up to its title . An elegy for youth , for love , for the vibrancy of a life lived ? By posing these questions but not deliberately answering them Ms. Coixet manages to explore the poetry of the quotidian , returning home to a dark flat after work , and the everyday of poetry , beautiful women are invisible . One might argue that the setting , the academic elite of Manhattan in their tight little world , is a little too irksome but Kingsley 's ability to be both everyman -LRB- late middle-aged everyman -RRB- and intellectual rings true in terms of the film 's concern to discover why one might feel this sense of loss even when one still seems to have it all . Coixet 's use of light and space , sometimes claustrophobic sometimes decidedly panoramic expresses the various moods of character and situation in a subtle and affective manner . That elegy implies loss , and there is this in the film , it is the relationship to loss that these fine actors are able to draw out that opens up the emotional core of this film . While so many contemporary movies treat trauma as nothing more than plot point ` Elegy ' is able to suffuse its mise en scene with the elegiac mood . Let 's hope the director gets more work . " ,9
" Lovely film , heavy emotionally but worth sticking with . There are not many actors who can make you feel that they are not acting , but they are that character . Daniel Day Lewis managed it to a gold standard in There Will be Blood . And in this film Sir Ben works the same kind of magic somehow , he just seems to be the lonely intellectual he is playing . I have been lucky enough to meet this man and he is witty , engaging and anything but lonely . His performance brings out a stunning turn by Cruz and a lovely role from Hopper . I really liked this movie and I did like the twist at the end . SPOILER HERE : A reminder really that we are all dying , life is precious , age is immaterial . " ,8
" The Fear of Old Age Loneliness . It happened by chance that I noticed in this movie adaptation of Philip Roth 's The Dying Animal . Being an admirer of his writing , I decided to see how his work translates into cinema . I had n't any expectations , save that I expected a movie about the complications of love relationships , a specialty of Roth , a cynical approach at sex , another specialty of the author , and at least great performances from Ben Kingsley and Pen lope Cruz . It met my expectations and more . First of all , this is an amazing ensemble movie . Ben Kingsley is , of course , amazing as David Kepesh , an aging college teacher and art critic , who has a problem with commitments and relationships ; he lives from one-slight stands and quick affairs ; his only lasting relationship is with Carolyn , a former student -LRB- Patricia Clarkson -RRB- who has sex with him whenever she 's in town . At 66 , Kingsley is in a perfect shape and still projects a lot of sensuality and grace . It 's not hard to understand why he captures the imagination of his student Consuela Castillo -LRB- Cruz -RRB- . Cruz is not convincing as the student in her twenties she 's supposed to play , but I chalk that up to whoever did the casting . Otherwise , she 's fascinating as a young woman who slowly falls in love with her teacher and gives him a bigger role in her life than he is ready to allow . This is the heart of the movie : Consuela , who wants David to spend the rest of his life with her , versus the commitment-free David who walked out of a disastrous marriage never to try it again . This simple premise is supported by their great performances , plus the talents of Patricia Clarkson , who plays an aging woman who shares David 's philosophy about relationships ; and Peter Sarsgaard , who plays David 's son , a successful doctor who never got over the fact he abandoned him and his mother . Their difficult attempt at reconnecting after a long time is a wonderful subplot in itself . And then there 's the amazing Dennis Hopper . I had no idea he was in this movie until I reached the cinema and saw his name on the poster . It 's such a pleasure watching him playing a three-dimensional character in a good movie . Why he does n't get more roles in dramas is beyond me . In Elegy he plays George O'Hearn , a poet , David 's best friend and a wife-cheating womanizer . It 's a short role , but I loved ever moment Kingsley and Hopper were on screen together , talking about love , art , women , infidelity , all this over warm coffee in the morning . There 's a feeling these two have known each other for decades and have no secrets . I have no idea who Isabel Coixet is , but she 's crafted an interesting , and mature , drama , about falling in love , the fear of growing old and the horror of loneliness . It 's a short but demanding movie . It certainly wo n't leave anyone with a bright outlook on life , but I think it 's honest and rewarding . It has to be , coming from Philip Roth . Although I have n't read this particular novel by Roth to judge , I think Nicholas Meyer did a good job writing an interesting movie . A last element I think is worth mentioning is Jean-Claude Larrieu 's cinematography , which many times captures people in silhouette as if suspended in a world of light and darkness , making Elegy a visually-beautiful movie . " ,8
" Well Done . David Kepesh -LRB- Kingsley -RRB- , a college professor , falls head over heels in love with one of his students , Consuela -LRB- Cruz -RRB- who is 30-years his junior . Do n't you just hate it when a movie title sends you to a dictionary ? What bothered me is that Elegy is defined as a poem or song for someone who is dead according to Webster . This story is based upon a novella by Philip Roth entitled The Dying Animal . See where the movie title and book title are at odds ? Yes , someone died , but not one of the major characters , David or Consuela , and the story was not about the one who died . We do not know why a beautiful woman , Consuela , would fall in love with David , who is 30-years older than she is . Just accept it . It happens -LRB- not to me but to others -RRB- . The romance is seen like two teenagers feeling each other out -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- . Actually , it 's kind of nice to see this back and forth . First we have to get over the fact that David is Father Time and we do . We like him . The dialogue and the performances of Kingsley and Cruz are the winners throughout and the dialogue is simple , direct , caring , and respectful . Just like when we were teenagers back in the day and maybe that is why we do n't mind this relationship . We remember . When I first noticed that Ben Kingsley was playing the part of a womanizer , I thought the Sexy Beast was released again . That was a name given him as a character in one of his previous movies and I can not recall which one . But , that was not the case here . His David was an attentive lover . As for Penelope Cruz , I always knew she is a pretty woman , but in this movie she became one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen . And , in the nude scenes that show her breasts , her beauty becomes amplified if that is possible . Nothing cheesy in here . Very well done . Dennis Hopper and Patricia Clarkson play vents for Kingsley 's David . Everyone needs someone to talk to without reprisals . They did good as did all others in the cast . Violence : No . Sex : Yes . Nudity : Yes . Language : Yes , some not much " ,7
" Sustaining the believability of love . Fifteen minutes into this film , I had to shut it down to cook supper for my visiting daughter . She 's twelve , and is ever curious about the movie disks I may have lying around at the moment . `` That 's a sad little movie , '' I told her when she held up the Elegy disk . `` It 's about a two people who are supposed to be in love , but you can tell that in real life , as actors , they do n't really like each other . '' Later when daughter had gone back home to her mother 's place , I put the disk back in and resumed the film . How wrong I had been to judge by the first fifteen minutes . Ben Kingsley brought more feeling to his role than I 've ever seen him do , and Penelope Cruz -- how can I say it without exposing the huge number she registers on my Richter scale ? Her performance is not just a heartquake but a magnitude 7 earthquake . In our age of hook-up and skate away , Penelope Cruz sustains in her performances the believability of love . For the photoshoot , which we can only wish that times had permitted Sophia Loren also to do , we must thank the film 's director for capturing the unreclaimable , ephemeral Penelope aboard her wave . " ,9
" Carried by powerhouse performances . The acting in this movie is superb . Staring with the lead 's , Kingsley and Cruz , they offer a new type of realism to a relationship involving two people with over a 30 year age difference . We do not know who we are going to fall in love with and it is common for marriages to end or become unstable for no reason in particular . Dennis Hopper serves perfectly as Kingsley 's ` boyfriend ' and provides a very subtle , believable performance . Some of his dialogue was immaculate as well -LRB- for example , Beautiful women are invisible -RRB- . Saarsgard portrays Kingley 's son so well . From the first time he walked onto the screen , I realized they had picked the right actor for the job no worries . He 's very good as the ` good ' boy with such high morals until he realizes the complexities of life . This movie started off really well , but for some reason did not have a massive impact to towards the end , although it still finished off nicely . A nice dramatic movie , with really good performances , but not a masterpiece ! It also carries the message that our future is unexpected and life is very complicated . " ,8
" Fine acting saves a trite story . This adaptation of one of Philip Roth 's lesser novels -LRB- The Dying Animal -RRB- , published in 2001 , succeeds brilliantly in its own right . Isabel Coixet -LRB- who is indeed from Barcelona -RRB- has allowed her two lead actors , Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz , to burrow into their roles and produce an entirely credible story of a May and December relationship which seems doomed from the start , yet plays out in an unexpected fashion . As David Kepesh , a New York eng lit professor long divorced who habitually seduces one of his students each year -LRB- once he has graded their exam -RRB- , Kingsley oozes charm and cynicism . Yet he makes it quite believable that such a creature could fall in love , despite the urgings of his old friend George the poet -LRB- Dennis Hopper -RRB- and despite his convenient relationship with a female version of himself , Carolyn -LRB- Patricia Clarkson -RRB- who pops in to his apartment from time to time for regular servicing . Penelope Cruz is also a revelation . As the bright eyed Cuban-American student Consuela who falls in love with a man thirty years older she gives us every reason to think she 's for real . Consuela may have had a somewhat sheltered background -LRB- her family is wealthy -RRB- but she is no fool , and unlike Kepesh she can see past external appearances to the man within . The only problem is that although Kepesh is an educated , witty and charming intellectual , something of a celebrity in fact , he has a fear of commitment so strong that any emotional relationship he has is bound to be a disaster , as we see from the uncomfortable scenes with his adult son , now a doctor , who has still not forgiven Kepesh from deserting him and his mother many years ago . Ben Kingsley lets us read his character 's feelings on his face ; dialogue is scarcely necessary . His performance is so strong we almost forget that he is actually not a very nice person . At the end he is committed all right , but not enjoying it very much . Kepesh combines commitment phobia with jealousy he does n't want anyone to have what he wants , but ca n't bring himself to take . Most of the action takes place indoors , so it scarcely matters that filming was completed not in New York but in Vancouver -LRB- some of the minor roles are taken by young Canadian actors -RRB- . Patricia Clarkson is exactly right as Kepesh 's sex buddy and Dennis Hopper is fine as Kepesh 's only friend George . He had some of the best lines , which always helps . Deborah Harry , the musician , pops up as George 's put-upon wife and Peter Sarsgaard is quite moving as the still-angry son . This movie bears out the adage that not-so-good novels can make good films . It is worth seeing for the acting alone , with Ben Kingsley back on top form and Penelope Cruz proving you do n't have to be ugly to be a good actor . " ,9
" My pick of the Year ! . I have to say that I think anyone who is n't moved by this film is dead to life . My wife and I were spellbound by the visual beauty and stunning reality of this movie , and while Kingsley was very , very good I think this has to be Penelope Cruz ' best role . The way the film worships her beauty only to climax with its devastation is one the best feats of directorial art I 've ever seen . There are n't enough stars to pin on this triumphant film . I 'm very surprised this film snuck by me as I 'm always interested in Kingsley 's acting and Cruz ' beauty and charm . I do n't remember ever hearing about it before and I 'm simply unable to understand how anyone could possibly find it boring unless their only criterion for good films is car chases and explosions .

" beautifully made , well acted love story from a Philip Roth novel . Yes my friends , another film based an a novel by Philip Roth . Being a popular novelist does not mean the author is a good one . See spoiler note below to find out why , Mr.Roth tugs at the heart strings the wrong way most of the time . Nicholas Meyer is an excellent screenplay writer he does his best here , What can you do with a story like this using the following SPOILER . in the last half hour we find out our heroine -LRB- well played by Penelope Cruz -RRB- needs an operation for breast cancer . . Mr Roth 's novel takes place in this day and age , her reactions are those of a women of 50 years ago . One more bit of illogic is the scene in the hospital room ; this is right after she is out of intensive care , there are no IV holders anywhere present , also her face hair are perfectly made up . DID someone goof . Now for what I liked , the acting general production values are excellent . Ben Kingsley Penelope Cruz are first rate in a May-December romance . The other major roles are equally good , played by Dennis Hopper Patricia Clarkson , Peter Sarsgaard as Ben 's Doctor son is also first rate . Isobel Coixet is the director , she seems capable . The music score -LRB- mostly piano solos -RRB- is excellent . If you pay little attention to the last half hour I feel you will still enjoy this drama . Ratings : \*\*\* -LRB- out of 4 -RRB- 81 points -LRB- out of 100 -RRB- IMDb 7 -LRB- out of 10 -RRB- " ,7
" just beautiful . Elegy is a beautiful film . Quite possibly Isabelle Quixet 's most accomplished and mature work to date . She might explore similar themes over and over again but still she manages to put on a new layer of meaning each time . This time it 's about the possibility of love beyond age and the difficulties of commitment . Elegy is a character driven piece , one that draws its power from the dialogues and interplays of the actors . An important part of the director 's job is to bring out the best from his or her actors . Isabelle Quixet pulls this off brilliantly . Ben Kingsley gives one of the greatest performances of his career as the professor who is trying to get in terms with ageing . He had a really difficult job because he had to convince the viewer that even at his age he is man enough to seduce a beautiful young woman played by Penelope Cruz . Kingsley succeeds no doubt because never for a minute during the film have I thought that their relationship would n't ring true or seemed unrealistic . Penelope Cruz brings her usual charm and grace to the film and as it is said in the movie she is a work of art . I do n't remember seeing her more beautiful than in Elegy . It would be blasphemous no to mention the supporting cast as well Patricia Clarkson , Peter Sarsgaard and Dennis Hopper all bring their best to make the film work . It was especially good to see Mr Hopper in a meaningful role . The music and cinematography should be mentioned too because they each contribute a lot to the overall experience . I must admit I left the theater deeply moved and thought about the movie for several days . Strongly recommended for those who appreciate movies that have the courage to be slow , dialogue-driven and emotional . " ,9
" Mature drama . A very interesting movie about death , old age and the relationships between mature men and much younger women . Based on a novel by Philip Roth , Ben Kingsley plays a long time divorced literature professor in his mid sixties . After having an affair with a student -LRB- played by Penelope Cruz -RRB- , this very selfish man finds himself -LRB- to his surprise , since he has always rejected commitment in his life -RRB- , to be insanely jealous about her . In the opening segment , the Kingsley character is shown being interviewed in a radio show about puritanism in America , claiming how much what good the sixties did in overthrowing the old sexual morality . Yet , whether this was the intention of the filmmakers or not , this film shows the new sexual morality resulting in loneliness , bitterness , heartlessness . Me , I prefer hypocrisy to these anytime of the day . Kingsley has a great performance , but the best acting comes from Dennis Hopper , as a poet and Kingsley 's only friend , giving him usually sane advice . A very interesting movie that is only tarnished in the last fifteen minutes , when the Cruz character gets breast cancer , and the film becomes bathed in sentimentality and unnecessary pathos . " ,8
" Cruz is monumental in this musing about mortality , monogamy and love . . Astonishing at times , a lot of a very impressive Kingsley 's scenes are stolen by a monumental Penelope Cruz , this is her finest work yet . Inexplicably ` Elegy ' still is n't cut out to be a grand masterpiece , the instant Cruz vanishes from the screen the film 's urgency slowly fades , only to return in the last couple of scenes when she does . What is grand about it are the dialogs , in particular in the first half of the film there are memorable lines galore , the second half holds some beauties as well : all the exchanges between Hopper and Kingsley are pure gold , as they scope women and talk about regrets and getting old . They 're a pair of womanizers with an unusually precise ability of self-evaluation and display a moving honesty in that judging . Other elements that stood out : the meditations about aging and monogamy , love and life , are very well done . The film tries very hard not to manipulate but instead observe and let the viewer do the thinking . It 's very rare to find a movie that possesses such a quality . Even the best script in the world makes for a lousy film without the actors to sell it , besides Cruz being a tad old for the role the casting is inspired , Patricia Clarkson also leaves an impression as Kingsley 's ever-giving yet never-demanding lover , perhaps the only woman who ever understood him , it 's a beautiful character and Clarkson portrays here with grace and dignity . It 's about theme these actors got the opportunity to star in a film that deserves their talent , especially Kingsley has n't done anything memorable in way too long . For those among you who in the meantime have gotten the impression that ` Elegy ' is just another depressing , humorless , grotesque excruciating drama , do n't worry , you 're way off . Except for the ending the film never gets preachy or alienates it 's viewers through pretentious cinematography , unnatural dialog or a series of unrealistically dramatic scenes following one another from beginning to end . If you 'd look at the film , or the book , again in a couple of years it 'll have considerably changed . As a youthful guy , reviewing a film about mortality , I can impossibly estimate how my perception will change as the years pass , but I suspect it 'll become an even more interesting -LRB- yet probably more painful to watch -RRB- piece of art . Do n't miss this one ! " ,7
" Prolonged immaturity\/narcissism finally transformed . This film is focused on the experience and development of `` David '' -LRB- Kingsley -RRB- , a professor , literary\/arts critic , host of a NYC local TV book review show , hobby photographer ; he 's in his sixties . Previously married and a father , he labels that period -LRB- marriage -RRB- as a sentence doing hard time . Instead of genuine emotional closeness caring , David substitutes sexual conquests . For sexual servicing , he 's maintained a 20 year relationship with a business woman -LRB- Clarkson -RRB- between her out of town travels ; she 's maybe 10-15 years younger and this gives sexual benefits without emotional closeness to both -- David 's led her to believe he 's sexually faithful to her . David 's incapable of giving meaningful emotional support to his son despite his son 's awkward tries to bridge the gulf . He selects and seduces an attractive female student from each of his classes -LRB- after final grades are turned in each semester -RRB- for ego boost and synthetic closeness . His closest meaningful relation is with a male confidant -LRB- Hopper -RRB- , a married poet\/professor , with whom he regularly plays racquet ball and shares his exploits with women -- seemingly seeking advice -LRB- which he does n't follow -RRB- but mainly used as a means of bragging . David 's very rarely capable of giving support to this friend . A very interesting but hardly admirable man . The movie deals with his most recent seduction , a beautiful Latino student -LRB- `` Consuela '' \/ Penelope Cruz -RRB- . She 's mature beyond her years but slowly succumbs to his seduction . The May-December relationship endures long past the usual next semester -- it lasts for two years . He thinks -LRB- correctly IMO -RRB- that she has an exceptionally beautiful body and breasts . During this time , David slowly grows increasingly concerned that the age difference between them will lead her to reject him at some point rather than the usual reverse . His suspicion that she 's seeing someone else mounts and he keeps checking on her . Consuela invites David to her graduation party -LRB- her MFA -RRB- given by her family ; she very much wants them to meet David and vice-versa . David accepts but calls her at the party , saying that a traffic tie-up prevents him from attending . This breaks them apart and they do not see each other for a couple years until she calls him to say she has breast cancer . She wants him to photograph her -LRB- nude -RRB- before her mastectomy . She remarks that now she 's older -LRB- closer to death -RRB- than he is . This triggers David 's release from his longstanding aversion to emotional closeness and he goes to her bedside after the operation to give her emotional support . The movie 's main point -LRB- IMO -RRB- is how a significant event -LRB- such as a loss or threat of loss -RRB- sometimes leads to a profound emotional transformation . GREAT cast , great acting ; great music and photography . This is a movie that many older people will appreciate for the dilemma presented . I see by the rating votes -LRB- at this time -RRB- that girls less than 18 also rate it highly -LRB- for fairy tale qualities ? -RRB- . Those preferring physical action , car chases . etc. , should see something else -- they wo n't like it . I 'm a retired therapist university professor and I enjoyed it . Quibbles : The movie does n't show any reasons as to why a young , attractive , bright , mature woman would be attracted to such an older , emotionally crippled man . Also , she 's from an involved , close Latino family yet she 's hidden from them and her friends her breast cancer and operation . While that act is not an absolute impossibility , it 'd be SO rare that something VERY remarkable would have to happen to cause that . The narrative clearly delineates much of David 's psyche but little or nothing of those closest to him . As for the transformation , it somewhat reminds me of a cartoon in which a professor filled an entire blackboard with a terribly complicated equation which ends with an equal sign -- he then says to the colleague who 's been watching this , `` AND THEN A MIRACLE HAPPENS ! '' " ,8
" A paean to his woman . About the Nobel Committee for Literature bestowing its prize to South African novelist Doris Lessing , `` Fear of Flying '' author Erica Jong wrote , `` They could have given it to Phillip Roth for paeans to his penis . '' Roth 's novels , as evidenced by Jong 's comments , are unapologetically open about male sexuality , and `` Elegy '' -LRB- based on the 2001 's `` The Dying Animal '' -RRB- is no exception . From Jong 's perspective , the literature professor 's clean , shaven pate makes the senescent philanderer , in figurative quintessence , a `` d \*\*\* head '' . David Kapesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- minces no words about his intentions with Consuela Castillo -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- . He wants to f \*\*\* her . Professor Kapesh is a pig , but an honest pig . Womanizers like the professor `` do n't pretend to care about women 's rights , '' because men with convoluted moral universes have their own idiosyncratic code of ethics . Moreover , sensitive guys `` want free love , '' too ; they 're just less honest about it , observes Dana Spiotta in her novel about radicalism , then and now , called `` Eat the Document '' . To eat the `` p \*\*\*\* '' , David compares Consuela 's eyes to a Goya model in a painting where the woman is clearly subjected to the male gaze . He does n't try to woo her with Frida Kahlo 's `` Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird '' . Good pig . Concurrent with the sensual ministrations of his May\/December relationship , David does Carolyn -LRB- Patricia Clarkson -RRB- , a woman who is old enough to be his ... wife . But no , she 's a former student , the professor 's `` f \*\*\* buddy '' who becomes wife-like when she suspects her longtime partner-in-crime of fooling around . Although David has no moral obligation to be faithful towards this woman , and this relationship , built around platonic lust and unconditional love , a binary between the two women manifests itself , nonetheless , in which Carolyn assumes the role of David 's wife , and Consuela , his mistress . There 's a tacit agreement the filmmaker has with its audience , that Consuela , thirty years the professor 's junior , is a home-wrecker , even though his home with Carolyn is a transitory one , or rather , a cheap motel of perpetuity . A relationship with Carolyn , the audience reasons , stands a better chance for permanence than this torrid fling with a hot , young thing . In essence , Professor Kepesh cheats on Consuela , but it fails to register as a serious transgression on his part , because the audience identifies , and agrees with his paranoid assertion that , given time , the young woman will leave him for a younger man . After many unsuccessful attempts to circulate David among her immediate circle of friends and family , the professor , her `` boyfriend '' , finally relents and was due for an appearance at a small gathering for the birthday girl . When David breaks his promise , and worse , concocts a lame excuse for being a no-show , `` Elegy '' persuades the audience that it 's the professor 's shame about their age difference , as being the primary reason behind his breach of mutual trust that is supposed to exist between committed lovers . While this may very well be true , David 's imagining of the potential revulsion on her guests ' faces , while he sits in his car and goes over the math , chagrined , needs to be coupled with the commitment-phobe 's assertion that their disapproval might not be worth the embarrassment . He picks the wrong moment to listen to his friend 's advice , Pulitzer Prize-winning poet George O'Hearn -LRB- Dennis Hopper -RRB- , who advises David , during one of their hyper-machismo luncheons , that their love was n't built to last . But to the professor 's surprise , Consuela 's love is the stronger love , that comprises an imbalanced aggregation of esteem , in which the `` real work of art '' -LRB- how the wizened man describes his latest , and last conquest -RRB- needs to lose some of her Goya-ness , her painterly aesthetics , before the professor can really see this woman , he previously loved as only an object . `` Elegy '' is about a man who forgot how his last narcissistic song of praise went , and finally learned from a good woman , the lesson that love has its own separate music from sex . " ,7
" Roger Ebert 's review . Just reading the many long reviews posted , I can see how this movie has moved so many viewers . Like all of Coixet 's films , it makes the audience think and feel , and never leave anyone unaffected . Coixet and Meyer have done a terrific job of neutralizing Roth 's male fantasies . Kingsley in the `` male '' role transforms the story by presenting himself as this totally assured professional and successful man who hides many scars that are only perceptible when Penelope enters his life . Just another comment on the first review posted on the ELEGY page . I read Roger Ebert 's review and many of his comments were included in this review without making reference to the source . Perhaps the guidelines for writing comments should stress that `` borrowing '' must be acknowledged . " ,9
" below average . I went into this movie hardly knowing anything about the story . I should have done more research . I suppose it 's a laudable effort , but it falls flat completely , in my opinion . The budding romance between the old prof -LRB- Kingsley -RRB- and the young hot Cruz is just okay . She 's obviously a sexy woman , but seeing her in that situation with the professor made her seem less appealing , not more . Another thing that really bothered me about this movie was the pretentious classical music that was throughout . It became unbearable after a while , I must say . Negatives : Trite story acted out with no passion or innovation . Positives : Cruz is beautiful and intriguing but that 's not enough to make this even mildly entertaining . " ,2
" The `` Plan 9 from Outer Space '' of sob stories . My first reaction while watching this dismal fantasy was that it was n't written from experience or as an attempt to convey some kind of life awareness but that it was coming purely from some Adolph 's poor imagination . I would have walked out of the screening but I became fascinated at the depths of inanity this movie plunged its audience into , deeper and deeper . `` Could this movie possibly get any phonier ? '' I continually kept wondering . It could . It did . That was worth watching in the same way the above mentioned `` Plan 9 from Outer Space '' is worth watching , in that it , too , took itself supremely seriously but was simply so awful as to be laughable . I did develop a great appreciation of the hard work actors go through . How could they deliver such phony lines without falling onto the floor in gales of uncontrollable laughter ? I would want to kill myself if I had to deliver such artificial , untrue-to-life lines with serious expressions on my face . How did the actors in this movie do that ? So that is what it means to be a professional . I doff my hat to them . That must take either super-human efforts or inherent dullness . I hope that I did n't disturb the few other people in the audience with my stifled laughter , I did try to keep the guffaws silent . Perhaps I began to take the movie as a hilarious satire , as the movie surely must have been meant to be taken , when a woman , with whom the prof had been having a decades long , purely sexual relationship on occasion , found another woman 's tampon in the prof 's bathroom -LRB- like that was the first time something like that had happened in twenty years -RRB- , and then she went ballistic at the immorality of it all -LRB- as if she were his newlywed wife to whom he had pledged eternal fidelity , ha ha -RRB- . Or did I start laughing when he stalks Consuela to a dance club where she is having a ball with her peers . He enters the club looking quite a bit as archaic as Boris Karloff in the original `` Mummy '' and she still phones him later . See what I mean ? If you can get by the gloominess , the phony seriousness and the pompous assedness of the whole thing the entire movie becomes rolling-on-the - floor funny . " ,2
" Touching film . It 's quite slow-paced - perhaps a bit too slow-paced - but the film does have its charms . Ben Kingsley plays David Kepesh , an ageing lecturer who seduces his students . His mid-life crisis is quite tragic to watch , as he pushes away twenty-four-year-old mature student Consuela -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- , despite their love for each other . This is a nice tale about age-gap relationships and whether they can ever work , and about the attempts to find love and settle down when you 're in your fifties . The ending is a little melodramatic but the film 's not a bad watch , even though the sight of Ben Kingsley topless is not something you 'll really want to see . " ,7
" Melodramatic and pretentious , but still quite watchable . The plot : A celebrated professor falls in love with a student 30 years younger than him . I was n't sure that I wanted to watch this movie , even though it 's got a great cast . I 've never been drawn to Philip Roth , though I ca n't say that I dislike his writing , because I 've never read any of his books . The subject matter and themes do n't really excite me . So , with some degree of skepticism and pessimism , I saw down to watch Elegy . Much like the protagonist , this movie is exploitative , with pretensions toward High Art . Elegy is a story about Love , Lust , the Human Condition , Aging , and other melodramatic concepts with capital letters . Middle-aged men are likely to find it insightful , real , and powerful . Others may see it as nothing more than a fantasy for old men . There are elements of truth to both interpretations . I lean more toward the latter , but it was still a well-made movie , with quite a few good actors . I ca n't say that I 'm any more likely to read Philip Roth 's books , but I can now say that I understand the draw that some people feel toward his themes . I have a certain degree of tolerance for melodrama and pretentious writing -LRB- being a fan of some Gothic Romanticism -RRB- , but my own tastes tend to veer more toward postmodernism and pulp -LRB- with Stephen King being a prominent guilty pleasure -RRB- . Neurotic , insecure , old men jealously obsessing over young women does n't really appeal to me on an artistic level , though I suppose this is probably as good a story can be told about such an idea . " ,7
" Pieces of Roth 's Life ! . Sir Ben Kingsley played David Kepesh , a British Jewish professor at a New York City university perhaps Columbia in Manhattan . David Kepesh is really Philip Roth , an American Jewish writer and professor , at a crossroads in his life where he faces aging and dying all at once . The book title was really the Dying Animal . Anyway , the cast is excellent with Ben Kingsley in the role . Penelope Cruz is brilliant as the young student Consuela who wins David 's heart in a passionate love affair . Dennis Hopper is also wonderful as David 's friend and colleague . Patricia Clarkson is also wonderful as Caroline , David 's sometime girlfriend . I think the film does a decent job even though they filmed the movie in Vancouver and not New York City . The relationships among the characters are believable and even likable . Peter Saarsgaard plays David 's estranged son , Teddy . The film is worth watching especially for Penelope Cruz who does the best job in her role . " ,7
" Elegy - Great Movie . I totally loved this movie . I am really surprised it was n't more popular ... or maybe it was but I did n't know :-RRB- This is the kind of movie that proves it is n't a high budget and special effects that make a great film . The acting is superb . Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz made a great pair . The movie sets you in kind of an anxious nervousness the whole time and you can see the wrong decisions being made . It 's a romance film that keeps you on your toes . I 'm not sure if I was happy or sad at the end but I might have cried a little :-RRB- If you have n't seen it already , see it . " ,10
" Good cast but silly ending . David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- is a professor with a really colorful personal life . After leaving his wife and son , he has a string of casual affairs . At a lecture he is giving , he meets Consuela -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- and is smitten by her beauty . They start dating but Davey also has another girlfriend , a former student he has been seeing for 20 years . Consuela invites him to her graduation party so that he can meet her parents but he is afraid to meet them in addition to his commitment phobia , so he makes up an excuse to miss the party . Dave 's best friend dies , his son has a blow out with him over the old mans infidelities and then admits to one of his own ; like father , like son . Back to Consuela and more drama which becomes a little far fetched , most especially a ridiculous scene involving Dave and a camera ; I 'll just leave it there . The cast is superb but the ending silly , so it is a slight recommendation . " ,7
" At your Crossroads , which path will you take . . Life with crossroads happen . Every person has a crossroad to define the next segment of our lives , either the road not taken or the risk of judgment makes cowards of us all . Wisdom comes from truthfully looking back at those choices and helping the next generation . Kingsley 's character has the choice comes at the invitation to a party . Whether it is nobler to join our friends in the decision to join their choices or hide away and hope the fix happens without them . If you can imagine the noblest among us having difficulty dealing with these decisions , you can imagine us mere mortals frozen by the same choice . The answer is to know the difference between the week and the weekend , the importance of the work of our life and the course of our lives . To bear the brunt of the slings and arrows of our heart or jump into a life not known we all know . To enjoy the pursuit of happiness for whatever short time we have or to chicken out in the comfortable world we have created . Choose the bold , is the lesson this movie teaches me . Aim for the top even if you are just a teacher on TV . It 's Penelope Cruz for crying out loud and every minute it lasts has a chance to be the best life can bring . Their are so many parties we have decided to skip even though we know afterwards , when the pain in our chest subsides , we will be stronger for the decision , no matter the foolishness it may present . " ,10
" Three Quarters Good . Penelope Cruz is 10 years too old for the role , but she 's plausible as a 22-year-old and surpassingly beautiful . Ben Kingsley is a formidable actor . And both Dennis Hopper and Patricia Clarkson are excellent . Although it may be difficult to understand why a gorgeous young girl like Consuela Castillo -LRB- Cruz -RRB- would fall in love with a professor 30 years her senior , Kingsley makes it believable . And with the presence of Patricia Clarkson as the professor 's sometimes lover of many years and Dennis Hopper as a sage -LRB- ? -RRB- old poet and friend , the eventual cooling of the passionate relationship seems quite natural . But when it turns out that Consuela has breast cancer and reinserts herself into the professor 's life , we are in maudlin Love Story territory and the movie simply can not carry the weight . Why ? Because , while she is a or maybe the major character , the story is really not about Consuela but about the professor coming to terms with his advancing age . So the focus is less on the likelihood that this beautiful young girl will die without having lived than on the certainty that the older man may have to face a burden and endure a grief he had n't bargained for . It 's a good movie , well acted but an impossible mix to swallow without gagging . " ,7
" Middle of the Night . . Philip Roth 's writing , though fluid as always , has gotten repetitious and a little slapdash over the years . And since Portnoy 's Complaint they 've usually seemed vaguely autobiographical . If this story is equally self referential , no man can do anything but envy Roth and his character because , despite all the doubt and anguish , gets to have a decades-long affair with the foxy Patricia Clarkson and a shorter but still intense one with the incomparable Penelope Cruz . Ben Kingsley is the sophisticated professor of sorts who has an affair with Cruz . Cruz professes to love him but demands his trust when she 's away from him . Kingsley is being torn apart by his attraction for Cruz , for Clarkson , and by his own guilt over the thirty-plus years of difference in age between him and Cruz . He 's also , sensibly , I think , concerned that , whatever claims Cruz makes , she 's interested in him because he is an authority figure who plays the piano and explains the paintings of Goya to her . She certainly seems sincere in her love for Kingsley , but can she be a closet groupie ? It 's handled delicately by the director , Isabel Coixet . There is absolutely nothing about it that 's in your face . The points are made quietly and the story moves on . A recurring figure in Kingsley 's life is Dennis Hopper as a long-married friend who shows up from time to time to help the aging prof and offer common-sense advice . Dennis Hopper , former infant terrible , owns the part . He 's as good as he 's ever been in a muted role . It 's reminiscent of Paddy Chayevky 's Middle of the Night , except more fragile . It also reminds one of a Woody Allen movie , except without the interpolated one liners . Nice choice of simple piano or cello music as both source and overscore . A love story for adults . Nice job by all concerned . " ,7
" Misanthropic Professor 's ` redemption ' comes a little too late in the game . Why wo n't they learn ? I 'll say it over and over : sad sacks do not make for good drama . And Ben Kingsley 's David Kepesh is the ultimate sad sack . Virtually everything about him is negative : his terrible relationship with his son stemming from his decision to leave his wife years ago ; a 20 year old relationship with a woman that he routinely has sex with but ca n't get intimate with ; a penchant for lying ; low esteem and worst of all inability to commit . We 're first introduced to Kepesh as he 's interviewed by Charlie Rose . We find out that he 's a older professor whose had some success as a cultural critic . There 's some literary talk sprinkled throughout the film that at first seduces the film-goer into believing that this might be some kind of brooding intellectual psychodrama a la Ingmar Bergman . Alas it is not ! What it 's really about is a character whom we can care little about precisely because he 's such a wuss . Kepesh 's wussiness is manifested in his obsession with Penelope Cruz 's Consuela Castillo . Her character , by the way , is even less developed then the aging , self-absorbed professor . Basically , she 's Kepesh 's love object ; anything distinctive about her personality does not appear to be reflected in the Elegy screenplay . What 's worse is her motivation for falling for creepy Kepesh . Is it simply because he 's an older guy ? Given his constant dour mood , I fail to see why she would be attracted to Kepesh . All kinds of red flags would have went up for Consula the second Kepesh shows up at the club , obviously jealous and trying to spy on her . And he lies to her about why he showed up to boot . That 's the sign of a loser a blatant wuss , so where was Consuela 's wuss detector ' ? -- obviously turned off until she ultimately sees the light . But would a normal woman cut a guy like Kepesh so much slack , and for so long ? I think not ! I found it painful to watch the scenes where Kepesh and his oncologist son go toe to toe . The son is as much as a sad sack as the father he 's positively guilt ridden over his own infidelity . Why are virtually all the characters in the film so full of angst ? How about a character who actually enjoys the affair he 's having ? You 'll notice there 's absolutely no humor in this film whatsoever a sign that the director and her creative team take themselves a little too seriously . After plodding along for so long , we come to the manipulative plot twist at the climax . Would n't you know it but our nondescript Consuela now has cancer ! Where are all those wonderful family members who showed up at her graduation party ? -- the one that Kepesh bailed out on . Now only the cowardly Kepesh is there for her . But you see we soon learn that Kepesh is n't such an emotional basket case as we were led to believe after all ! He actually cries when he finds out Counsela is ill and does everything he can to comfort her during her last days on this earth . In my view , Kepesh 's ` redemption ' comes a little too late in the game . By the time he cradles the dying Consuela , I 've already written him off as a die-hard misanthrope ! Elegy is not without a few bright spots . The late Dennis Hopper does well as Kepesh 's former Pulitzer Prize winning buddy , George O'Hearn , who correctly predicts that his relationship with Counsela is going nowhere . And Patricia Clarkson as Carolyn , Kepesh 's long-term mistress , manages to convey some world-weary wisdom . Kudos to director Isabel Coixet for the excellent cinematography one of the DVD bonus features reveals that Coixet shot many scenes herself in conjunction with her director of photography . There are also interviews with the principal actors who sing the praises of the film to high heaven . Despite the beautiful look to the film , I lose faith every time I see a film where the actors truly believe they 're creating something profound but in reality are peddling nothing more than abject pretentiousness masquerading as an aesthetic masterpiece .

" Some movies shout . Others whisper . Elegy is the latter . . Some movies shout . Others whisper . Elegy is the latter . Not some stultifying susurration like rustling leaves , though every bit as gentle . Rather , Elegy is so scintillatingly sparse that you can clearly hear the powerful sound of hearts beating , sometimes together , but mostly alone . The cast is breathtaking , each marshaling their considerable talents not just in perfect harmony , but also in astonishing synergy . In a world drunk on megastars and blockbusters , it 's easy to forget that there are actors , real actors , towering talents who , though their names might not be on the tip of your tongue , can , quite simply , act their asses off without chewing the scenery like a rapacious raptor . Pick one . Every member of the cast is superb , delivering Oscar caliber performances so seemingly effortlessly that you almost do n't notice that that 's Deborah Harry , or Dennis Hopper , or , well , you get the picture . Ben Kingsley and Pen lope Cruz , perhaps surprisingly , generate enormous energy t te - - t te . Not the bawdy burst of thunder , but the infinitely more subtle and brilliant electricity of lightning . The story revolves around a complacent intellectual -LRB- Kingsley -RRB- who successfully secures his ivory tower into an unassailable fortress until he sets out to seduce a beautiful young student -LRB- Cruz -RRB- . It is adapted from Philip Roth 's novel The Dying Animal , and one wonders which animal , and which manner of dying , Roth had in mind with the title , as there are degrees of death throughout . Roth is best known literarily for Portnoy 's Complaint , and cinematically for Goodbye Columbus -LRB- both movies having featured Richard Benjamin -RRB- , but this story deserves its place among his uvre . Director Isabel Coixet , probably better known for her French films , wore many hats , even acting as camera operator and music supervisor . She is gifted by a screenplay exquisitely crafted by Nicholas Meyer , himself an accomplished director as well as writer . Again , the synergy is obvious , as the movie coheres in every detail . This movie languished in my Netflix queue for far too long . Do n't make the same mistake . This is a rare treat for real movie fans . " ,10
" Snuck Under the Radar , But Worth Tracking Down . An older professor starts an affair with one of his students , who takes it a bit more seriously than he does . But , surprisingly , he finds that he is more attached to her than he is willing to admit . Various complications arise , and what could be seen as a strange pairing becomes hard to maintain -- but maybe worth the fight . I have waited too long between viewing this film and reviewing it to really make a decent review . But , what I can say is this : these are some of the best performances you 're ever going to see from Ben Kingsley or Penelope Cruz . Kingsley seems to be entering a renaissance , taking what could be average films and bumping them up . Dennis Hopper is good here , too , though he was not crucial and not as memorable as you might expect . I am still young as I write this , not even thirty , so I do not know the world of romance on the level that Kingsley 's character does . But he is very contemplative about life and aging , and anyone who is thoughtful , philosophical or enjoys films that are even slightly deep should find some value in the themes explored here . It is unique , as far as I can tell , and not some rehash of the same old film that comes out each and every year . Ebert says The movie is not great ... -LRB- but -RRB- I 'm not sure why . I disagree . I think the movie is , in fact , great . He stills gives the film three stars but laments that he is sick of older , slimy intellectuals preying on younger women . I think the film is deeper than that . This is not a reimagining of Lolita by any means . Give a chance ; I 'm going to give it another one . " ,8
" Aptly Titled Meditation on an Aging Cultured Gentleman . Elegy , is an apt title for this beautiful , although at times , labored story about an emotionally stunted aged gentleman who finally discovers a passion for life . The lyrically shot film by Spanish director Isabel Coixet is a sojourn into the very cultured and stand offish David Kepesh , played wonderfully by Ben Kingsley as a respected critic , author and professor who falls in love with a student , Consuela Castillo , -LRB- played terrifically by Penelope Cruz , who should be arrested for theft for stealing this film -RRB- and how she turns his once orderly and independent life upside down . I really felt frustrated watching Ben Kingsley 's character , as a grown , distinguished gentleman , he was still a foolish teenager , until tragedies start to make him aware of his own mortality and just how important relationships are . He has a contentious relationship with his son , -LRB- played underwhelming by Peter Saarsgard -RRB- and a seemingly perfect -LRB- at least for him -RRB- friend with benefits relationship with his friend Carolyn , -LRB- played very well by Patricia Clarkson -RRB- . I always like Miss Clarkson and she does n't disappoint again . The comic relief comes in the form of David 's best friend George , -LRB- played with fun and philosophical whimsy by Dennis Hopper -RRB- an accomplished poet but also a fellow immature man who betrays his wife , but who has a poignant idea about beautiful women and how men see -LRB- or not see -RRB- them . He seems to be David 's Jiminy Cricket . Again , Penelope Cruz really takes the film away and the scenes she is not in , the film tends to bog down . I have been steadily impressed with Miss Cruz 's development as an actor and am finding myself more and more looking forward to seeing her work . Overall , I liked the acting and how the actors would work off of each other . Most seemed to be clear on how they felt , with the exception of Peter Saarsgard , who it seemed at first as if he did but it felt muddled later on . However , Elegy itself , is a good film but not memorable , except for one sobering beautiful scene between Ben and Penelope . I did enjoy seeing the development of David , but it does n't come as a surprise , you see it coming . A better film about a man coming to grips with age , in the comfort of a younger women is Venus , with Peter O'Toole in an Oscar nominated performance . http:\/\/tbreviewer.blogspot.com\/ " ,7
" Love Means Never Having to Say ... Much . As many of the reviewers on this page have noted , the movie Elegy is beautifully filmed , stunningly acted , and ferociously under-motivated . It is the story of a much older professor and his much younger student , who pass through each other 's lives with minimal emotional contact with each other and virtually none to engage the viewer . I find both characters superficial , foggy , and distant . Is that the point of the film ? Penelope Cruz is pretty , fresh , and shallow . What does the professor , Ben Kingsley , see in her ? A diversion only ? His rhetoric promises more , but what ? He is pompous , cold , old , and filled with NYC intellectual abstractions that are thinly disguised veils for his creepy -LRB- read cultural critic -RRB- narcissism . Is she simply deluded in her interest in him and he so self-individuated as to be rigidly remote ? Where is real feeling here ? As for story structure , two deus-ex-diseases -- Hopper 's stroke and her cancer -- are more than my tolerance for fatalistic sentimentality can bear . At the end , when she is dying -LRB- I presume -RRB- of her disease and the professor crawls into her bed at the hospital , it would not surprise me if Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw joined them . " ,3
" This movie is an elegy . I bought this movie late yesterday . It is now 10.00 am the following morning and in that time I have watched if twice . I fully expect to watch it again in the next day or two . I honestly can not imagine a more perfect movie or one that has moved me quite so much . Every step it takes , every line spoken , every scene seems in harmony with itself and the others . The soundtrack is moving and beautiful , the actors perfect for their roles . There is not one jarring moment in this movie and the story is real - not perhaps real in the sense that it specifically happened like this to the people depicted , otherwise I suppose it would be a documentary of sorts , but it is real in the sense that this is how it does happen to real people . An elegy is a sad poem . This movie is an elegy . " ,9
" The dying animal . Professor David Kepesh has a thing about aging . In spite of his years , he keeps ogling those vulnerable young women that are attracted to his classes of literature . He is also a notable critic whose taste is the measure for others to either accept or despise a work of art , a play , or photography , in which this talented man dabbles on . Every term the professor goes after one of the impressionable women that feel worthy of David 's attention . As the story begins , one realizes the object of his interest is the beautiful Consuela Castillo , a Cuban-American young woman that seems to have everything going for her . David exerting his charm takes her to his bed and a sexual kind of romance begins . David , who has also been seeing other women , has been in an on and off relationship with Carolyn , a lady of a certain age with a lot of class . Since both David and Carolyn are fully aware of what they expect from one another , it is cool to get together for sex every now and again . But David has a big problem . He has fallen deeply for Consuela . This young woman is special . In conversations with his close friend , the poet George O'Hearn , David discusses the situation openly with his pal . George , being perhaps more of a realist advises his friend not to get too deep into something that might hurt him in the end . David , who has been invited to Consuela 's graduation party , decides not to go for fear of what her family will think about him . As he fails to show , he invents a silly story about having car troubles , something that anyone can see is a lie . Consuela decides to stay away from him . David , who has left his wife years ago , is surprised by the visit of his son Kenny , an oncologist . Kenny , who is married , confesses he is having an affair with another woman . His father tries to put some sense into him , but the son resents the advice . Two years go by . It 's New Year 's eve and David gets a phone call from Consuela . He obviously never stopped thinking about her . The only problem is that now she has a sad news to tell him . Her only request for David is that he photograph her so that he can have her image forever . Phillip Roth novella The Dying Animal is the basis of this film which was adapted for the screen by Nicholas Mayer , who also worked on the screenplay of another Roth 's novel , The Human Stain , both work involve romances between older men and younger women . Mr. Mayer is more successful this time out , perhaps because being a short work , it translated much better than the earlier one . Mr. Roth should insist in getting Isabel Coixet , the Spanish director , whenever any of his books are made into films because this lady treats the material in an almost reverential way . Ben Kingsley is a great asset as David Kepesh . Being an American in the book he speaks with a British inflection that goes well with the character he is playing . He is always an interesting actor to watch . Penelope Cruz shows in all her beauty like in no other American films in which she has appeared . Perhaps she felt secure in being guided by a fellow Spaniard like Ms. Coixet to give life to Consuela . The wonderful Patricia Clarkson appears as Carolyn . She is a welcome presence anytime , as she proves here . Dennis Hopper plays George , who is David 's best friend . Deborah Harry is seen as George 's wife . Jean-Claude Larrieu , who has collaborated with Ms. Coitex before , shows why he is one of the best cinematographers working today . Most of the music we hear in the background belongs to Erik Satie . " ,7
" Kingsley mis-cast . Elegy is a film about a professor , David Kepesh , who falls in love with a young woman . It 's not about their relationship , nor about the lack of a relationship with his estranged son - even his close friendship with a poet only exists in order to allow articulation of his analysis and misgivings when we need a break from the intermittent voice-over . It 's about Kepesh alone , how he reacts to a seismic emotional shift in his life and why . Yet the absorbing central performance that this demands is not forthcoming . I want to say that Ben Kingsley 's acting is under-par , neutral , as it 's less involving than other characterisations . However , one can not deny the intensity of his performance . So instead I have to say that he is miscast , his rigid hauteur ill-suited for a man brooking overwhelming self-doubt and regret to an almost suicidal extent . Isabel Coixet is no help . The film looks quite good but rolls out at a single pace allowing no space in which to dip and dive between burgeoning love and the rash moments that come with fear . The music is not well-judged either , invariable in its temperament . It simply accentuates the gap between the exotic potential of the fine performance -LRB- and simply presence -RRB- of Penelope Cruz and the earth-bound , wing-clipped film in which she appears . 4\/10 " ,4
" An interesting experience . I have to say I did not like director Isabel Coixet 's previous work.My Life Without Me and the intolerable The Secret Life of Words had bored me pretty much , they were pretentious and they did not have too much to say.However , I think Coixet made her best movie so far with Elegy , her most recent film.This movie is far from being great , but it avoids many problems from her previous movies , at the same time it was an interesting experience to me , something completely different to My Life Without Me and The Secret Life of Words.I usually do not praise the title of a movie but , in this case , I have to do it.An elegy is a poetic lament which announces the lost of something ... or somebody.And I think that word perfectly summarizes the message and content from this movie.If you see this film , you will understand what I am talking about.The main character from Elegy uses a dug intellectualism to seduce Consuela -LRB- the other main character -RRB- , and on some way , I think the movie uses the same trick with the spectator.Elegy has many solemn dialogs and reflexive ideas but , beyond their surface , I found them as a methodical trick the movie uses to make the spectator feel impressed with its apparent intelligence.In other words , I think this movie thinks it is more intelligent than what it really is , and I think that 's the worst fail from it.Another negative element is that some moments felt a little bit boring.The character of Professor Kepesh is very interesting because of his emotional complexity.I think that character was perfectly developed by the screenplay , although I must add that it also helps it was performed by Ben Kingsley , who brings a phenomenal performance.He is so involved with his character that he never seems to be acting at all.An extraordinary achievement from Kingsley which was unfortunately ignored.Pen lope Cruz is an excellent actress but , for some reason , she did not convince me too much with her performance on this movie.I think she could not completely become into her character.Patricia Clarkson is brilliant as always and , although her appearance is not too long , she shows credibility and conviction.And I also appreciated the performance from the great Dennis Hopper , which is serious and honest , although it has a touch of irreverent humor.Coixet 's sparing direction works well because it lets the story to be developed with sobriety and elegance , but without loosing the emotional impact from certain scenes.Elegy is far from being a great movie but I had an interesting experience watching it.I think that a little bit less of pretentiousness on the screenplay would have worked better but this movie deserves a recommendation in spite of its fails .

" A Nutshell Review : Elegy . An elegy . A form of poetry that mourns of something that has deteriorated . And in this film there could n't be more references to this term , forming the basis of the theme and everything that happens to all the characters involved in this pensive , melancholic piece . Based on the novel by Philip Roth and directed by Isabel Coixet , this film stars Ben Kingsley as culture critic and lecturer David Kepesh , and snapshots his life during the twilight years , where physical deterioration does n't mean a proportionate deterioration in sex drive . Or at least that 's what the character 's first impression to the audience was . Through narration , we get to hear David 's innermost thoughts , where he candidly reveals both his fear of growing old , and private moments where he honestly shares with us his feelings especially toward the new and beautiful student in his class , Consuela -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- . While aware of the 30 odd years age gap separating them , that does n't mean that he 's going to give up his game of skirting around the sexual harassment decorum of the school . In fact , his physical relationship with his student form the crux of the film , about perceived societal pressure and disdain for cradle snatchers , of how one 's initial motive of a short fling could turn out to be something more serious and emotional , and relationship insecurities on both sides - with one understandably jealous of some unseen , young strapping hunk there to take his lady love away , and of the other worried that there might be commitment issues with a man so advanced in his age . But what lifted this movie into a different emotional stratosphere , are the supporting cast and characters that surround David 's life , either providing counsel , or problems and issues to deal with altogether . A visibly aged Dennis Hopper plays David 's best friend and poet George O'Hearn , who while on one hand goads him to do the right thing -LRB- or ending it all off -RRB- , he too might seem a little hypocritical , and brings about a fleeting notion of infidelity to the table too . And it seems that dysfunctional characters in the relationship sense permeates through the film at every corner . We have David 's F \* - buddy Carolyn -LRB- Patricia Clarkson -RRB- who 's an alpha-female type character with all the luck at the professional level , but none whatsoever on the personal front , and David 's estranged son Kenneth , played by the excellent and terribly under-rated actor Peter Sarsgaard , who shares some of the most poignant and memorable scenes in the movie opposite Ben Kingsley , trading some very quick witted barbs . Just as when you thought the film might seem to have reached is plateau , it surprises one with a startling development that would on one hand seem to satisfy the voyeur in the audience -LRB- given the rating , and consistent audible yawns during the non-sexual moments -RRB- , but on the other push through that sense of regret that makes you feel for the characters . Excellent acting from the ensemble cast , and with relationship themes that many could identify with , would make Elegy earn that recommended status from me . " ,8
" A short piece of a professor s life . A short piece of a professor s life , who falls in love with one of his young student - that is Elegy . 80 % of the first half of the movie is happening in bed , including the dialogues -LRB- of course -RRB- . These are inimitable , ironical , sarcastic , and honest . Interesting is that the professor knows that this short love story must end , and he is also repeating it the whole time , but when this moment comes he starts doing strange things . Film is sometimes surprising , especially the dialogues I have already mentioned . Elegy is worked very properly . At first it seems like an average -LRB- a typical American love story -RRB- movie , but it changes after a time : some kind of energy is radiating from it , like in the book of Phillip Roth . This is an enormous plus , because it means that it succeeded the same purpose as the book did - that the reader \/ viewer will not forget it soon ! " ,8
" what is the short line Kingsley says as he walks towards her room ? . I just saw Elegy tonight and it was amazing . I think on a superficial level people see this film as an old man looking for young women to score with , but it is so much more than that . It 's late , but there is one thing driving me crazy and I 'm hoping you can help me ! Near the end of the film , as he enters the hospital and walked down the hallway towards her room , he says something ... it 's a voice over ... it 's only 3 or 4 words and other than that , the walk is dead quiet . What is it he said about life ???? When he SAID it , I thought it was the meaning of the entire movie , but I forgot it before I got home . Anyone ?? help ? James " ,8
" a somber and mature -LRB- maybe too mature -RRB- examination of mortality and love . Elegy is contemplative , somber and well-acted , but it 's not exactly for a wide audience range . As a twenty-something , I related to it on an intellectual level and appreciated the quality and subtlety of the performances . But on an emotional level , it feels made for an older , may-or-maybe not wiser audience that knows this kind of character of David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- who 's accomplished a lot as far as his career goes as a professor and author but is older -LRB- early 60s -RRB- and without a real significant love until 30-something Consuela -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- . It 's very much in tune with that fear of aging , fear of not having really loved -LRB- if maybe , consequently , lots of loss -RRB- , and it 's actually much more recommendable for that older audience than those of a younger crowd who are tuning in , more or less , for a glimpse of Cruz 's mammaries . As far as these older-professor-in-love-with-younger-woman tales go , Husbands and Wives had a better grasp of it in just the scope of a sub-plot , and if it feels slightly like a retread -LRB- or that you 'd rather just read the original Philip Roth story -RRB- , it 's not without reason . Yet it 's also enjoyable for the intimate atmosphere from director Coixet and seeing people like Kingsley and Cruz and Hopper and Sarsgaard in smaller roles doing work in a real `` film '' , not a movie , and fulfilling their characters quite succinctly . It might be more fun watching Kingsley and Cruz from other movies they 've been in this year - The Wackness and Vicki Cristina Barcelona respectively - but Elegy does carry some firm ideas , expressed well , and suffers only from a little airy bits and some less-than-satisfactory narration .

" Dreary adaptation of Phillip Roth book , typically fails to contain any of the biting wit and vulgar energy of Roth 's writing . A big disappointment . . I find it hard to understand how viewers could be positive about this film , as I found it appalling . Film-makers should give up on Phillip Roth adaptations unless they can give them the necessary energy ; and biting , incisive and vulgar insights that are so much a part of Roth 's work . In stead in this film , like most of the other Roth adaptations , we get pretentious literary performances that mostly bore and frustrate . I could n't even make it through to the end , and I have a bookshelf of Phillip Roth books - and rate him as my favorite living American author . Ultimately , I found this film a big disappointment and suggest you read the book rather than endure the film . " ,1
" Dreadful movie gives older men chasing young girls a bad name . . There 's nothing wrong with mature men going after younger women 30 to 35 years their junior ; in fact I recommend it as one of the best things in life . Just do n't use this dreadful movie as a blueprint . On the positive side , the acting and directing are first rate . Both Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz deliver performances which are better than you might expect . The trouble lies with the source material and the author Phillip Roth . Roth 's mess-up of his own life and relationships is well documented in public . Suffice to say that a small minded man with a serious shortage of the wisdom most of us accumulate by age 55 is ill-equipped to either write good novels or create characters we can relate to . Ben Kingsley 's David is a selfish and shallow loser who 's life view of women mirrors my own view of Avis cars : Use 'em and lose 'em . Having zero charisma or sex appeal we can only assume David has any sex life simply because the woebegone script says so . There is no reason why the Hispanic student -LRB- Cruz -RRB- is open to his attentions even though she says in effect that men are better than boys . Surely she could attract a real man and not settle for this creep . There 's one brief scene in which thinking members of the slim audience for this film may take comfort in time wasted : Near the end we see Penelope Cruz caress the cheek of her lover with the bottom of her foot . Having a lovely girl-foot against one 's cheek is a lovely thing to happen . Any real man would savor this -LRB- as does Kingsley -RRB- . " ,1
" Ben Kingsleys life without ... . A good friend of mine was very excited about this movie . He could n't wait for the movie to come out , because he loved the movie `` My life without me '' so much -LRB- I like the movie too , although he simply adores it -RRB- , so we went and watched it together . Afterwards -LRB- or a few days later -RRB- he also got to see the director in a caf in Berlin -LRB- ca n't confirm if he proposed to her -LRB- popped the question or whatever you wan na call it -RRB- ... Seriously though , this movie is a slow paced drama , pacing wise not unlike `` My life without me '' and has also as a story thread the idea of loss . But it 's far from a rehash or something like that . This is a complete new film , with a very good Ben Kingsley and a great Penelope Cruz . Even Dennis Hopper is at his best , reminding us that he can actually act -LRB- also reminding us what a waste of talent many of his movies are\/were -RRB- . But this relationship drama revolves around a few basic questions , some that even you might ask yourself from time to time ... do n't expect it to give you definite answers though ! " ,7
" He only gets his rocks off when he 's crying . I have n't read the book , but it is n't surprising that a movie based on a late-period Philip Roth novel revolves around an older man struggling to commit to a younger woman he has somehow wooed . In this case , David Kepesh -LRB- Ben Kingsley -RRB- is the awkward intellectual who only appears comfortable in front of a classroom or on the radio . Somehow , he 's a prolific ladies ' man , so much so that he woos Consuela Castillo -LRB- Penelope Cruz -RRB- , a student in his class about 30 years younger . That 's all fine , but the movie focuses on Kepesh , at the expense of developing any of the other actors sufficiently . Kingsley plays Kepesh as a bag of neuroses trying to get over himself and failing , while the frequent voiceovers and certain characters -LRB- most especially Dennis Hopper 's -RRB- scream `` plot device '' . If it were n't for Cruz 's beauty and skilled acting , if with a flat character , the movie would be unbearable . A pathetic lead and undeveloped support makes for a bad movie , but the last act of the movie at least crystallizes into a message for the movie : the weakness of the male gender , and their inability to control themselves or know themselves . If this was a touch more explicit and the rest of the surroundings taken care of with more depth , Elegy might have been a nice movie . As is , it 's unnecessary . " ,4
" Penelope cruises on with another improved performance ! . Here is my elegy for the movie Elegy : Penelope you have once again showed your Penelopes on film , Thank you my dear ! You are a breast ahead of many other famed actresses who will not reveal their naked truths . Your character of Consuela Castillo , a college student who falls for a geriatric college professor , was obviously blinded for beauty but empathetic on the sexual needs of an aging man ; Thank you again my dear . OK , enough of Elegism ! Elegy is Director Isabel Coixet 's film adaptation of Phillip Roth 's best seller of the senior-aged college professor David Kepesh and his passionate romance with the stunning college student Consuelo . Ben Kingsley stars as Kepesh and portrays him quite solidly as a conflicted man facing the last chapter of his life and suddenly derailed by the intelligence , beauty , and charisma of an intoxicating young woman . The age difference of the two characters eventually becomes a barricade on the development of the relationship through David 's point of view . Will that eventually drive Kepesh to capiche Consuelo out of his life ? You have to read that Elegy to find out . Dennis Hopper co-stars as Kepesh 's professor colleague and best pal George O ' Hearn who like Kapesh gets quite old hearny , I mean horny when it comes to bedding beautiful younger women . There is too little of Patricia Clarkson as Carolyn , Kepesh 's longtime on the go sexual companion which consequently underdevelops the character as a needless factor in the story . Like most elegies , Elegy does contain too much monotonous melodrama . Writer Nicholas Meyer 's screenplay fixates immensely on the subjectivism of Kepesh which in turn degrades the character of Consuela as an undiscovered soul . I would have preferred the narrative to be told from Consuela 's point of view to enhance the authenticity of her relationship with the much older Kapesh . Penelope continues to impress on the silver screen with another commendable performance . Ms. Cruz is definitely an M.I.A. these days - Most Improved Actress . Elegy does compose itself quite admirably at times with strong starring performances and decent direction , but its overemotional script does downgrade it to mediocrity . \*\*\* Average " ,7
" Wrong turn . What starts out feeling like and upbeat and pithy comedy , Elegy turns out to be a maudlin and sad commentary on love and life and the mystery of who we are and what our purpose in life is supposed to be . To set the smarmy tone of the film Charlie Rose plays himself interviewing Kingsley 's famous cultural critic Kepesh in one of the inter-textual moments that the filmmaker felt would give her story a sense of place and present tense . Charlie Rose appears as if he is really interviewing a person from real life and references to Hugh Hefner are dropped in that perfect name-dropping Charlie Rose fashion to prove he is up on culture but also to send the message to the viewer that Kepesh is an old-timey romancer . We 've seen this production technique in better movies like You 've Got Mail and given the flat-footed way the film presents its lead character , which is basically a teacher taking advantage of his place in a university to feed his need for young lovers . Voice-overs have Kepesh , in a teacher-like lecturing voice intoning lines about how men view the world . When we says When you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life we believe that this is a man who will teach us about what it 's all about . What the film lacks is a transformative moment or sequence of events in which the inner motivation and emotional landscape of Kepesh is shown to us to let us into the tenor of the film . What we are given is the shell of the man 's life and without knowing why he does what he does we can only view the proceedings as a romantic comedy . The film has some excellent moments of love-making with both Pen lope Cruz and Patricia Clarkson but this just is n't enough to keep the movie up , but it 's still good for a few laughs as long as you do n't take it too seriously .

" Piano music is n't enough . Elegy turns on an old-Hollywood premise : if you say often enough - if you say over and over - that a character is beautiful -LRB- the standard trick with someone being groomed for stardom -RRB- then the public will believe it . Cruz has the kind of distant beauty that other women respond to and tell you about . The kind that works for cosmetics ads . The woman your sister thinks is so drop-dead fabulously gorgeous . When you meet her you see that she wears chic clothes , jewelry , and lots of makeup . But lacks any real sexiness . Although if you 're after a woman who always chooses the exact right necklace with the perfect dress ... The 1st half or so of the movie revolves around oh how beautiful Cruz is : Kingsley acts it out by staring at her ; the camera reinforces it ; he tells you in narration several times ; and he discusses it with his best friend -LRB- and Greek Chorus -RRB- Hopper who makes various comments about beauty . Kingsley 's character is 30 + years older than Cruz 's . The age difference and her beauty make Kingsley insecure . And he develops REAL feelings , perhaps for the 1st time . Cruz is mostly smug - all-knowing beyond her years - and is able to explain some things about life and relationships to him . Piano music plays throughout most scenes - even when people are talking - so you 're aware of just how significant every hand gesture and head turn is . Sarsgaard plays Kingsley 's irritating son . Irritating because you do n't really find out why he hates his dad so much . You 're told why , but you never feel any of it . Patricia Clarkson spells out her problems with Kingsley but you do n't feel this either . Deborah Harry is probably the best thing in her small role as Hopper 's wife . Despite the strong publicity campaign to sell Cruz an actress capable of the most incredible range of emotions , she 's always seemed to be moving through a soap opera . I know , I know , she 's in Almodovar movies so she must be the real thing . I mean , his movies mine the very depth of human emotions , no ? Here she does little to nothing . If the movie were in 5ths , the 3rd 4th parts are decent - Kingsley shows some depth and other characters are allowed to fill out . Cruz is not in these parts . The movie ends on a heavy note - again all talk . Cruz could be in any Lifetime dramafest here but I 'm sure the final scene will be acclaimed : an actress baring her very soul . No , sorry , a woman baring her very soul . Again , do n't worry about missing the meaning here because it 's spelled out for you . Net synopsis : an old rou falls in love with a fashion-industry poster while piano music plays . With her and then without her he learns the joy and sadness of life . But why am I telling you this ? The movie makes it so easy . It was great in fact - I did n't have to think at all . " ,4
" Does not make justice to the book . . It 's not a dreadful movie . The story is simple , the acting is consistent , the dialogues are acceptable , and there is a plot . Nevertheless , if you read The Dying Animal from Roth , you will feel kind of deceived due to the total failing in producing all the intensity , the drama or the superb dialogues and thoughts enclosed in that wonderful small book . One example is the relationship of the two men , far away from the clever and brainy relationship in the book . After all , though I 'm not an expert , such an adaptation seemed to be not so difficult to produce . The book is very clear and the plot very simple as I said . My impression is lack of a good script and a consistent direction , which in my opinion lost trek during the shooting of the purpose of this project . Watch the movie accompanied by a good wine if you like Kingsley 's and Hopper 's acting and Cruz breasts , though here she is far from being the sexual beast we are used seeing in other movies . " ,4
" Clich - infested , middle-brow soap . A lazily scripted male fantasy which never comes alive , despite Ms Cruz 's natural charm . When Penelope Cruz 's character , Consuela , tells David , her tutor\/lover -LRB- many years her senior -RRB- that he is a very charming man , it 's a summary of this lame , clich - ridden tale : we , the audience have to be told that David is charming , because there is no evidence of it in Ben Kingsley 's maddeningly self-conscious performance , nor in scriptwriter , N. Meyer 's characterisation of David . At least David is a tender lover of his student , Consuela -LRB- although Cruz seems too old for the part -RRB- , but why she loves him is a mystery . . she just does . Consuela is enchanting , but who is she ? What is her character ? She 's madly love with David , despite his very selfish treatment of her . They go for bog-standard walks on windswept beaches and he tells her he 'll take her away from all this -LRB- to Venice . . really ! -RRB- There are even glimpses of these walks through white picket fences -LRB- really ! -RRB- And if that 's not soapy enough for you , wait 'til . . no I sha n't give it away , but you may well be gobsmacked by the purple plot twist which turns this corny old May-December romance into a near bitter-sweet near tragedy , with music by Eric Satie -LRB- again ! really ! -RRB- I do n't mind corn laid on with a trowel , or even corn dressed up as drama , darling , as long as it 's done vivaciously . . this is n't . . it has a couple of moments where it almost comes to life , but it soon lapses back into formula . There 's even a father son sub-plot of staggering inanity , that must be a lesson in how not to write\/direct\/act . The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea , and leaves the world to darkness , and to better movies than this . . I hope . " ,3
" Old man 's sad fantasy . If the young-hottie-inexplicably-f \* cks-ugly-old-guy theme of this movie reminds you of The Human Stain , that would be because they are both based on novels by Philip Roth , who evidently either has been chronicling \* someone 's \* use of literary celebrity -LRB- Library of America editions already ! -RRB- to get awestruck girls into bed , or else enjoys writing out his harmless fantasies about same . In either case , who can blame him ? It does make for some Oh , please moments , but this movie is somewhat better than The Human Stain because it is a real love story . The ugly old guy actually falls in love with the young hottie ; he breaks off the relationship because the problems presented by the 30-year difference in their ages seem insurmountable to him , only to find out two years later that the young hottie was in love with him all along , not merely an infatuated young lit-groupie . Sadly , the movie solves the age-difference problem by giving the young hottie breast cancer , which , as she puts it , now makes her feel like the older one . This shamefully simple-minded plot twist supposedly makes the two of them a little bit closer in the looks department -LRB- but not really - I mean , it 's Penelope Cruz vs Ben Kingsley -RRB- , deprives the ugly old guy of one of the young hottie 's breasts that he loved so much by way of punishment for being such a lecher , and , in the worst case , might put them on their death beds at about the same time . Problem solved , if you 're a senile writer or a heartless filmmaker , but it leaves a very , very bad taste in the viewer 's mouth . Ben Kingsley is quite good in this , as is the always-likable Dennis Hopper in an uncharacteristic role as a dispenser of sane advice -LRB- which turns out to be wrong -RRB- . And , of course , Penelope Cruz spends a lot of time topless . Our final glimpse of her breasts comes when she asks Ben Kingsley to photograph them before her mastectomy . It is meant to be the elegiac scene that gives the movie its title , but there is something embarrassing and almost laughable about it , as if the writer 's fantasies finally run away with him . -LRB- In fairness to Roth , I am told the novel ends differently . -RRB- If I had written it , it probably would have been about getting a last glimpse of a woman 's double-D 's before she has breast reduction surgery to relieve her backaches , so it 's all relative , is n't it ? " ,7
" Feed it to the croc . Junk . Pure and simple . An unnecessary and useless sequel to the self-mocking and campy comedy\/horror Lake Placid . Not one of the original cast signed on for this dog , a very good decision on their part . Well , the baby crocodiles you see in the closing of the other movie apparently have grown up , and now have decided to pick up where their parents left off , and eat lots of people . John Schneider is the sheriff , and just grins a lot . Cloris Leachman reprises Betty White 's nut job -LRB- as her sister -RRB- , but without the funny lines . A big game hunter with grenade launchers fails to match Oliver Platt 's role , and the Bridgette Fonda look-alike also does nothing . Sheriff John has summertime custody of a poor actor teen son , in order to introduce some annoying cardboard cutout screaming teens . Since Croc Jr. seems to have an appetite for annoying cardboard cutout screaming teens , you quickly realize what their function to the story is , and you find yourself rooting for the croc to eat them as soon as possible . There 's one idiotic scene , apparently ripped off from the 3 Stooges , where a croc victim is talking while the creature behind him waits patiently for him to shut up , before devouring him . Nothing interesting happens . Really a bad movie , that fails at both horror and comedy . All it does is waste your time . " ,2
" Not worth the time . I 'd seen Lake Placid at a friend 's house one night , and thought it entertaining , so I was happy to see a sequel was going to be shown . Now though , I have to say I wish they had n't bothered . Overall , the movie is just poorly done . The acting is terrible ; even John Schneider , who I usually enjoy , disappointed me . I 'd equate the acting in the film with a middle school performance . And something was off with the sound - it almost sounds like they pre-recorded all the lines , and just matched it up with the film . The special effects , if possible , are even worse than the acting . Very fake looking , and extremely amateur ; this looks like a high school project ! There are several times when you can see parts of the crocodiles magically pass through things . On the plus side , little as it is , some of the characters were mildly entertaining in the sense that the acting was so terrible . There 's one actor in particular who screamed like a girl , and that made me laugh . I 'll also add that if you saw and liked the first , you may want to watch this just to satisfy your curiosity . Beyond that though , it 's not worth it . " ,3
" well , they tried , i guess . with a few nods to the original film , including Cloris Leachman playing the sister of Betty White 's unforgettable foul-mouthed character from the original , this film tries to step up to the plate . apparently set a few years after the original , there are suddenly more deaths , and , guess what ? a croc in the lake . actually , 3 this time around . John Schneider plays the sheriff and a cast of `` looks-familiar-but-don ` t-know their-name '' fills in the rest of the menu . the CGI is there , really noticeable and really bad , as it is in most of the sci-fi channel movies . at least there are some good-looking stereotyped kids thrown into the mix this time , camping at the lake at the worst possible time . David Kelly 's original script had some intelligence , great character development and nicely-done humor that is really missing here . i give them credit for trying , but it 's lacking ... well ... almost everything . " ,3
" I wanted to like it . . The first Lake Placid was the type of movie that you loved or hated . I loved it . The actors had chemistry . The script was clever . The key was to take it for what it was . A lot of people did and it developed a cult following . I wanted to love II . But , it was n't there . I think they tried . But chemistry and hitting the exact same note is hard . I think they put together a good cast . The writing was supposed to make you grin . It just did n't pull together tight enough . Nice Try . Lake Placid a tough film to duplicate on any level . I think a lot of the fans of the first one went into it with the right frame of mind . If you did n't see the first one you may not understand the choices they went with as far as corny dialogue and silliness . Maybe they can bring back Ms. Fonda for 3 ! " ,3
" A travesty on so many levels . I 've come to expect very little out of the SciFi channel 's made for TV movies , but this ranks tight alongside of `` Babylon 5 : Legend of the Rangers '' as am egregious example of how SciFi 's clueless network suits can prostitute a great work with an appallingly bad sequel . I 'm a great fan of the original `` Lake Placid '' . David E. Kelly 's writing in the original is among the sharpest of any film in memory . It had a delightfully witty script and excellent performances by talented actors . The characters were well textured without a stereotype among them . By comparison , the script of this film is drek . Thre is almost no wit evident . It 's trite and formulaic . The characters are all 2-dimensional stereotypes from central casting . The `` special '' effects were everything I 've come to expect from SciFi channel movies - ham-fisted and amateurish . I might have given this film a rating of 2 or 3 , but for potentially tainting the reputation of the original , I give it a 1 - but only because there 's no option to give it a zero ! " ,1
" Horrible movie . . I never saw the original , but I watched about an hour 's worth of Lake Placid 2 and I have to say , it SUCKED ! The story is basically the same as every other giant water monster movie : numerous deaths that happen around the lake , town panics , the sheriff goes in with a bunch of guys to take out whatever is causing them . Let 's not forgot the 5 idiotic teenagers that have a run-in with the movie 's giant crocodile . Let me get this off my back . Sci Fi Original movies are known for their suckiness , but in this case , it 's more painful to hear the script , then was in `` Minotaur '' . The sheriff is a complete idiot who is supposed to be the protagonist who seems to be so stupid that he acts casual even when he sees a giant crocodile eat a live man . The acting is so horrible and the script is just barely at the level of `` Uwe Boll '' quality . After the first death , you are introduced to a team of hunters who are hoping to get a little moolah for the creature that killed some fat guy in the beginning of the movie . The leader of this team has the WORST Scotish accent I have ever heard and hearing him and the Sheriff chat about guns and whether or not the lead female , Emma , likes him the most is so painful to hear that you just scream `` SHUT UP !!! '' at your TV . It is just surprising for me to see how unaffected a bunch of morons are when facing a giant reptile and how casual they act even when someone was just eaten . Then , there are the most annoying actors and actresses in the whole movie , even worse than the sheriff 's acting . The sheriff 's son who is there to visit his dad and is pretty bummed out of the fact that there is n't any cable , high-speed Internet , or cell phone reception located in the middle of hick country . Then , somehow , he gets involved with some girl , who he fancies , a guy in a tight white t-shirt who , I guess , is her boyfriend or something , a Paris-Hilton copy , and the drooling slob who wants to get in the Paris-Hilton copy 's pants . These teenagers are not only bad acting , but they are DEAF ! There are two examples of this : One is when Paris Hilton dies . While Slob , or Larry , is swimming around in the lake , somehow , a 20-foot-long croc is able to sneak past him and up to Paris ' feet and she says `` Larry , you pervert , get away from my feet . '' And gets eaten and you are happy that she is dead because that means that 10 % of the bad script has been cut off from your ears -LRB- if they are n't bleeding already -RRB- . The second example is when the sheriff 's son , the girl he likes , and the girl 's ` boyfriend ' find a crocodile 's nest and -LRB- of course -RRB- the retarded boyfriend starts crushing eggs , making a bad joke like `` I know what kind of egg this is . Scrambled . '' Then , the mom croc comes back and gives that `` Oh no you did n't '' impression and comes up behind the boyfriend , snarling and breathing loudly and even when the girl says `` There 's a giant crocodile behind you ! '' , he thinks it 's a joke and still does n't appear to hear the croc that is about 3 feet from him ! He dies , thank God , and then , -LRB- even though when she said `` There 's a giant crocodile behind you ! '' , the girl runs into the forest with the son and asks him `` What was that thing ? '' and the son replies `` I do n't know , but I bet it is what laid those eggs ! '' That 's when I turned off my TV and got onto my computer to warn you all about this horrible movie . I am usually VERY generous toward so-good-they 're - bad movies , but in this case , if someone who has seen `` House of the Dead '' and `` Bloodrayne '' from start-to-finish actually turns off the TV after watching an hour of `` Lake Placid 2 '' , you know you have a problem . Though it is clear that very few people will buy this movie , I do n't recommend renting it and if you see it re-running on Sci Fi , turn the channel QUICKLY ! Unlike `` House of the Dead '' , it is n't a bad movie that is funny to watch because of how much effort was put into it , it 's just an all-out bad movie that Sci Fi can add to their quite long `` Flops '' list . " ,1
" Awful !!!!!!!!!!!! . Lake Placid 2 is the sequel to the not so good Lake Placid . This movie stinks beyond undescribable words but I will try . The acting is terrible . It seems as though a page of script was written and shot at the same time . When the crocidile attacks , most of the characters seem so calm about it , even making jokes after one of their own has just been killed . I thought that maybe John Schneider might be the actor in the film but that honor goes to the dog in the film . Of course , the acting is only one flaw in this film . Another flaw is the script itself . The dialogue is incredibly bad and there are many scenes that just seem to make no sense . The most important part of the film is it 's direction . David Flores who is not noted for anything major but I ca n't seen a great future for this guy . There are many continuity mistakes and the characters all seem stiff ... The special effects are terrible . I am sure that in today 's era that even a made for TV movie can have decent special effects . The Crocidile looks awful and the death scenes are just garbage . There is no fear in this film . Sometimes I enjoy watching these ridiculous movies for a nice laugh but I could n't even enjoy it as a bad movie . If you want to see a good terrible movie , than watch other Made for Sci Fi movies like Crocidile and Crocidile 2 ... They are much better yet still terrible . " ,1
" An embarrassment to the word `` Movie . '' . Everything about this so called `` movie '' screams 3rd rate . It is a pathetic attempt to cash in on a film that was n't very good or successful to begin with ! Why this got made , who knows . The script is laughable , the effects are worse than video-games , and the plot is really dumb . Do n't waste your time , hell if you read this , you have spent too much time on this waste of celluloid . Every time you think movies ca n't get any worse , they do . I would be ashamed to have anything to do with this garbage . Here 's the plot , let 's kill these gators . The main characters are exactly the same as the 1st film too ! Not the same actors mind you , but the exact same character . The little old lady who likes the croc 's , the rich guy trying to kill them , even the beginning is almost exactly as the 1st film . I would recommend this to people that want to know what makes a bad movie , because this describes this `` not even worthy of being called a film . '' " ,1
" Lake Horrible . Sci-Fi channel movies are notorious for their constant cheeziness . This one should be perched at the very top of the heap . Since I loved the original , LAKE PLACID , I thought this might be at least an interesting experience . From the first scene to the last , this garbage proved that there are still Neanderthals out there in the movie making business . In the first shot , we see two men in a boat . One of them is quickly gobbled up by a giant croc . His companion merely stares at the water , blinks his eyes and says `` Oh , my God ! '' in the next scene , he is in the sheriff 's office and has told his story to the deputies . Their reactions ? They all sit around whooping and giggling and nudging each other as if they 've heard the funniest joke of the year . And then the sheriff drops in and asks this survivor what his problem is and the survivor merely shrugs and says `` there 's a problem '' out there on the lake . Even after the sheriff is nearly swallowed alive by the creature , he 's joking and laughing just seconds later . In fact , no one in the miserable cast ever act as if they 're in any danger at all . After every death , they 're all joking and laughing and skipping along as if nothing has happened . We 're treated -- if that 's the word -- to several scenes of the girls stripping off their bras . I guess we 're supposed to be panting with passion at this . One of the craziest scenes is when the hot-headed jerk is mouthing off to his two companions how he would never ever believe there 's a monster croc . One slips up right behind him , less than two feet away . His two companions merely stare and say , `` Eh , you 'd better come along . '' They act as if there 's a squirrel or a possum just a few feet away from them . Of course , the hot-headed jerk is swallowed alive and his companions skip away . And then one of them says , `` I ca n't believe I saw that . '' The special effects are the type you 'd find in an elementary school room . this would be a perfect laugh-out-loud movie to watch along with that other much-praised masterpiece of lousiness : HANDS OF MANOS . " ,1
" I 've seen enough to know it sucks . . I watched about 30 minutes of this movie and the acting was just horrible . I looked they were reading off the tree or something . The special effects of that crocodile were so awful . The look as the crocodile ate it 's victims did n't look as if they fit together . The CGI is horrible and the guy throwing the eggs is just stupid . Then the other guy says that they are chicken eggs . The eggs are about 20 pounds each ! Who wrote these lines in this movie ? Obviously this guy has never seen an egg in his whole life . Please , I beg the people out there to never see this movie . Even if you are bored out of your gored there are many more things better to do than watch this movie . Watching the toilet flush is more exciting . " ,1
" Rank , foul , and all things desirable in a B movie sequel . Unfortunately I did n't get to watch this on SciFi originally but saw a copy recently since they 're releasing it to DVD soon -LRB- www.lakeplacid2dvd.com -RRB- . After hearing Schneider was taking the lead I thought this could have gone somewhere . His acting was tolerable , and the characters were mildly entertaining , but the low budget sequel was simply that . It was so evident David Flores was trying to not only live up to the original , but to mimic it , painstakingly . From the plot , to the character quirks , even to the shocking one liners , we can see his aims at cult classic stardom . It falls horribly short , making for one amusing B movie wannabe . You watch a B movie for the unreal script and crappy effects anyway , why not take it a step farther . Our affinity towards flicks like Snakes on a Plane or Attack of the Killer Tomatoes , and any other horror-comedy is our intense desire to see some clever crap . Lake Placid 1 was clever crap , Lake Placid 2 was crap that tries to be clever . And it 's awesome watching the no name production team try . Who takes this kind of thing seriously anyway ? My opinion is , it 's worth the $ 4 movie rental . Kick back on a Wednesday night with a couple of beers , and I guarantee the banter between you and your buddies will be well worth your time . There 's a couple of KILLER one liners that 'll make their way into your hall of shame quote book , guaranteed . " ,4
" I still ca n't believe I watched this ! . All I can say is this was the worst remake of an original decent horror film I have ever witnessed . First of all , Cloris Leachman must have been desperate and in need of money to appear in this debacle . She must have been aware too because the Sci-Fi channel did n't even mention her name in the credits . Who wrote the scene -LRB- ought to be flogged -RRB- where she as ` Sadie Bickerman ' was attempting to push the young girl off the dock to feed the gator ? All I could think of was the fairy tale Hansel Gretel where the wicked witch was trying to push Gretel into the oven . So many visual errors too . One in particular shows Deputy Davis blow up one of the gators with a ` super gun ' after which he and his son return to the ranger station . Deputy Davis then -LRB- alone -RRB- leaves for the hunt again this time armed with a ` rifle ' , two bags of meat and some C-4 over his shoulder . Later in the woods when the chips are down and the gators attack , lo and behold out comes the ` super gun ' ... where 'd that come from ? He did n't have it when he returned to the hunt ! The ending if you can call it that shows the victors -LRB- surviving cast members -RRB- riding off to ` Bangor ' in a pickup truck to get something to eat . WHAT ! Who could eat after watching this ? Of course , unknown to Deputy Dawg , one of the ` gator ' eggs was salvaged and in a case on the front seat for examination at the ` lab ' . Thank my lucky stars it ended here . I fully expected to see the egg hatch while they were lunching on ` gator burgers ' in Bangor and escape to bring on a sequel to this thing they called a movie . The director came to his senses and called it day and we all will live happily ever after . Jakeman97 " ,1
" This Decade 's Houseboat Horror . Everyone in this film takes it too seriously . Its not tongue in cheek at all , it looks like it thinks it 's a real movie , which is what makes it so terrible . The actors look like they actually think that there 's a croc near this lake ... When clearly , and I mean , clearly , this is not the case . It 's very likely that there was as much money thrown at this as there was at the opening titles of Superman , which I also watched today -LRB- thought ` was much better ' , incidentally -RRB- . Oh , look , a fluffy white bunny rabbit ! What the hell is such a clean rabbit doing at a dirty lake anyway ? Schnieder looking in surprise at his poking stick after its been bitten off ... Right after a 40 foot croc eats the pig on the other end of it ? What did he expect ? Maybe he 's shocked that he accepted this script ! If the FX were n't so horribly bad -LRB- I assume they were made on a Commodore 64 -RRB- it would n't be so horrible -LRB- the script still needs some work -RRB- , but they are so amateur and dated that the film simply ca n't be taken seriously at all , making the performances seem ridiculously over acted , -LRB- the performances that is , not the ` actors ' that turned up for one day of shooting to take their clothes off , stage some unconvincing scenes and swim in filthy lake -RRB- . The glorious special FX of , say , Tarantula -LRB- 1955 -RRB- , spring to mind . And cheap cheap cheap . Sometimes the croc does n't even look like a croc -LRB- the dummy they actually hired -LRB- sometimes its not C64 animation , but not much -RRB- , but more so a big pile of crap floating on the water . It 's a paradox , they actually use the finished film as a prop on the movie Schnieder would be less annoying if he was n't grinning like a lunatic for half the film -LRB- though he can recognize which of the teens is dead from his sneaker -LRB- cause there 's only 7 in town -RRB- -RRB- , but McMurray is kinda funny , however not enough to stop me from writing a scathing review whilst I actually watch it to make it more fun . It lacks pretty much everything the first one has , in fact , it pretty much lacks everything any film has , which is unfortunate as I have nothing else new to watch tonight . \*\* SPOILER \*\* The dog survives . Maybe \* I \* should 've faked \* my \* own death ! " ,3
" Apparently Maine floated down the Atlantic coast , because everyone in this movie has a Southern accent . . I kept trying to figure out if `` Lake Placid 2 '' was supposed to take place in Maine , like the sequel was , because everyone in this movie has that Southern drawl . Then I see signs for Maine , Arostook County , etc. etc. and I 'm like , apparently the directors think a Maine accent and a Southern accent are one and the same . It 's an insult to the great state of Maine . Also , the one girl says she 's going to Boston College and will be moving to Newton , which she describes as `` south of Boston . '' No , it 's not . Newton is west of Boston . So , apparently the folks who did this movie have no concept for geography . As for the movie itself , it 's like `` Lake Placid '' except not nearly as good . The Betty White role of the weird old lady is taken over by Cloris Leachman , who is not nearly as hilarious . The crocodile stomp-a-thon was entertaining , but there was n't enough of it . And that 's the silly love-interest plot line that nobody cares about . Overall , there are worse crocodile movies -LRB- i.e. , `` Blood Surf '' -RRB- , but you could do better . " ,4
" Just Awful , plain awful . So last night , me and my roommate decide to watch it . We both liked the first one , so of course we are going to watch the second . Big mistake ... Every so often I would see my roommates head just shaking , and he would then laugh or comment about what we just saw - never a good comment . The Graphics were just bad , the crocs just looked so fake - the skin , movement , reactions , explosions . Even the air plane was fake . The acting was below par . At least in the first one they had real choppers and planes and such , and the croc looked a lot better in the first . The only thing I saw hope in was the fact that Cloris Leachman was part of the film -LRB- always been great in her past roles -RRB- , and she did a decent job in this role as well . She could have done a lot better than this film though . The basic story line was n't too bad ; but I have yet to see a great story line on crocs or gators . There are also tech problems in the film . Just things that do not truly add up or that make sense . The killing of the crocs with a knife\/blade , the eggs , the explosions , the eating of the people . It feels like they just through this movie together . Not much effort put into it . They could have put a lot more effort into this film , to do it justice . Instead they let it flop ... So I would say , spend your time watching something else . Actually now that I think about it , this movie is very similar to Jaws , maybe thats why the story line works . But again they did n't do it justice . It was a good laugh though , some funny moments , and just looking at what happens . You just want to laugh at its stupidity . " ,3
" an awful sequel to a not so good movie . i saw LAKE PLACID some months a go , and i thought it was pretty decent , not the best alligator movie out there , but i stayed awake . it was kind of funny though , to see betty white , a calm harmless woman be the caretaker of a monster . so LAKE PLACID was an okay movie . 2\/5 . but when i found out there was going to be a LAKE PLACID 2 , i was so excited . i thought , `` wow , lake placid 's makin ' a comeback ! '' . i saw it when it premiered in April . I was shocked . this was the dumbest film ever , next to Cruel Jaws . the funniest\/dumbest scene was that part when that girl says to the guy `` stop touching my feet '' and it turns out to be the 45 foot croc . how does she attempt to rescue herself ? she swats the croc with the magazine she 's holding like she 's trying to swat a fly ! she gets what she deserves , and the acting is just horrible . this film was basically a rip off of TREMORS -LRB- four predators -RRB- and ALLIGATOR . 1\/10 " ,1
" Lake Placid 2 . A sheriff -LRB- John Schneider , really stuck with some corner one liners when he blasts the monsters -RRB- must contend with several large crocodiles which are eating locals . His past lady-love , Helen -LRB- Sarah Lafleur -RRB- , an animal conservationist , along with an egotistical wealthy hunter -LRB- Sam McMurray -RRB- and his sidekick Ahmed -LRB- Joe Holt -RRB- will assist the sheriff in his duties to take each croc out . They try to pry knowledge about these crocs from Sadie Bickerman -LRB- Cloris Leachman , the only thing that works in this film is her nasty loathsome character who loves the crocs more than people -RRB- who loves her `` babies '' and seems unwilling to give them jack squat . Making matters worse is that the sheriff 's son -LRB- Chad Collins -RRB- , and his love-interest Kerri -LRB- Alice Ziegler -RRB- are fending for their lives after a couple of the crocs devoured their high school pals . Leave it to the always reliable Sci-Fi Channel to drop another rotten giant monster movie of low quality in our laps . . this one having the misfortune of being a sequel to the entertaining B-movie that came out year back from writer David E Kelley and director Steve Minor . While that film had a very enjoyable cast consisting of Bill Pullman , Bridget Fonda , Oliver Platt especially scene-stealing Betty White -LRB- . . Chloris plays Betty 's sister in the sequel -RRB- , this sequel has no-names with limited ability to even convey a minuscule of charm . It could be because the dialogue is so laughable and special effects so poor . How can anyone , much less Schneider proclaim the quip , `` Afterwhile , Crocodile ! `` and make it work ? " ,3
" Why ? Just , why ? . I really liked the first one , I thought it was well cast and written . So they made a sequel . It was like one of those Star Trek fan videos you see , where they make their own version of Star Trek . It 's got amateurish acting , directing , special effects and only the die hard fans would find it entertaining . I do n't know if this sequel was made by a die hard fan of the original , but it was written , cast and had special effects worthy of any Star Trek fan movie . Let 's just forget about the bad acting and special effects from 1990 . How this script was okayed and I do n't just mean by the director or producers , but the actors , is a mystery . Surely when they were reading their part they had to have went at some point `` man , there 's no way in the world someone would act this way at this point . '' The Sheriff 's co-worker is brutally eaten by the croc and he 's laughing and and hitting on the woman shortly after . In fact numerous people he knows are killed and he 's worried about getting the money for his boats that were destroyed . After a terrible 24 hours of battling crocs and seeing numerous people beheaded , having limbs torn from their bodies and chopped up by the crocs , he drops off his son with a girl and jokingly says `` okay , I 'm trusting you ! '' Then in the car with the hot chick , they 're talking about going to dinner and `` no talking about your ex-wife . '' Yeah , forget about the fact we just witnessed what should have been the most horrifying 24 hours a human would have to go through in real life , you better not talk about your ex while I 'm eating dinner . At no point does the idiot feel any remorse for losing what were supposed to be people he knew well . The acting was terrible and as is the case in every single one of these idiotic movies , we get yet another son who does n't like his dad and does n't want to be there . The son is a jerk and hates life . Poor son . Of course in this particular instance , to no one 's surprise with this awful casting , the son is probably about five years younger than the dad . Of course , everyone is a jerk in this movie and you do n't even get the satisfaction of wanting them to get eaten by the crocs because the special effects are so awful , the amateurs on the Star Trek fan films are actually better . At no point do you actually think anyone is getting eaten by anything . It 's baffling that a movie that obviously put some money into it could have effects this bad . The script was terrible and I 'll only give you one example of some of the amazingly terrible attempts at humor : Girl : You 're a jerk Guy -LRB- to assistant -RRB- : I think she likes me . Yikes . There is someone in this world who actually thought that would be funny . I 've seen better written dialog in a porno . I 'm not kidding . Some of the dialog will make you cringe . THIS is why you do more than one draft of a script , folks . Avoid this movie . " ,1
" 60 minutes in , another 24 could have driven me to who knows what . . This movie is not only a waste money , it took away 60 minutes of what I could have used as extra sleep . I was at my girl 's house and popped this in at 10 p.m. , knowing that I had work the next day , I waited for the movie to pick up , while trying to hold myself from busting up from the ridiculous acting , poor script , and CGI that was probably generated by the Director 's 6th grader son , hoping that in the next few minutes the movie would offer something interesting . But after seeing the Ahmad guy tell his boss that he 's finish doing deeds for him and then minutes later he tries to save his life , I just could n't sit there anymore , I turned the damn thing off before my exhaustion drive me to aggravation and might just break the damn DVD which I did n't want to end up paying for . Avoid this movie at all cost , if you ever did something for 84 minutes that you wished you 'll never do again , you should consider that instead of watching this garbage . " ,1
" A decent movie with some funny parts . The humor in this film is much more irony based ... the original Lake Placid was intended to be much more genuinely scary , this one will actually provide some good laughs if you go into it looking for the irony not the scare factor . The CGI in this movie is sub-par , but I think that this was somewhat intentional , it adds to the b-movie feel . The movie is not realistic , if it was it would be perceived as taking itself to seriously and would be stupid . Go into this movie looking for laughs and you will get them . Go into this movie looking for scares and you will come up disappointed . " ,7
" Worst movie knock off ever !! . When I heard that the Sci-Fi Channel was doing a Lake Placid 2 with John Schneider , I was looking forward to it . But after 20 minutes , I could n't believe how bad it was . The acting is the worst acting I have ever seen\/heard . It sounds like this movie was shot in a foreign country and dubbed in English . Except that all of these actors are Americans who speak English and this was filmed for Television , which means they did n't have to dub the bad language . I actually enjoy many of Sci-Fi 's B movies . But this is one of the worst I 've ever seen . The special effects are awful , which is surprising since I 've seen Sci-Fi do better with other movies . I 'd recommend watching the original Lake Placid instead of wasting the two hours watching this sequel . You will certainly enjoy it more . " ,1
" The Dukes of Placid . Peaceful Lake Placid in Maine suffers from a new series of missing persons . As the opening scene confirms , they are being eaten by giant crocodiles . Informed about the latest incident , wavy-haired blond sheriff John Schneider -LRB- as James Riley -RRB- jokes about the carnage . After seeing the remains of a victim , Mr. Schneider takes environmentally-conscious blonde girlfriend Sarah Lafleur -LRB- as Emma Warner -RRB- and EPA man Robert Blush -LRB- as Frank Mills -RRB- out to investigate . They find a severed head and decide to ask eccentric old Cloris Leachman -LRB- as Sadie Bickerman -RRB- about giant man-eating crocodiles ... Meanwhile , Schneider 's handsome young son Chad Collins -LRB- as Scott -RRB- , reluctantly staying with dad for a month due to a custody arrangement with his ex-wife , goes out looking to meet pretty blonde Alicia Ziegler -LRB- as Kerri -RRB- . She 's with a generally annoying group of college-aged friends ; as such , they will presumably be crocodile bait . The men are weighty , but the women look good getting topless . Interestingly , the sexiest scene belongs to Ms. Lafleur , shot lovingly as she gets in an out of the water wearing a black bikini ; it 's early in the movie . Also around is hunter Sam McMurray -LRB- as Jack Struthers -RRB- ... Continuity from the first Lake Placid -LRB- 1999 -RRB- is represented by Ms. Leachman , who plays the sister of Delores Bickerman . Betty White , who played Delores in the earlier movie , appears in a photograph . More Bickermans will appear in Lake Placid 3 -LRB- 2010 -RRB- . This silly story may frighten very young children , but most everyone else will laugh . Leachman is scarier than the crocodiles . Superfluous is Mr. McMurray and his subplot with slavish Joe Holt -LRB- as Ahmad -RRB- . Schneider , the former Dukes of Hazzard hunk , director David Flores and most of the characters play with knowing bemusement . \*\*\* Lake Placid 2 -LRB- 4\/28\/07 -RRB- David Flores ~ John Schneider , Chad Collins , Cloris Leachman , Sarah Lafleur " ,3
" A little bit better than the first , but with really cheap CGI ! . Upon hearing about the Sequels that followed the original Lake Placid , I was n't sure if this would be any good ! Considering that it was one of those Straight-to - DVD\/TV Films . The film starts out pretty much like the first Lake Placid ! 2 guys are in a boat in the middle of the lake collecting\/looking for samples , aside from talking crap about this and that causing one of the to get distracted then ... A crocodile attack takes place ! And the guy gets pulled under the water gets partially chewed up ! The other guy is then astonished looks around in confusing panic , calling his friends name out until the body of his friend lunges from the water he tries to save him by pulling him back into the boat a part of his body is in the hands of the guy who attempt to pull him in.etc ! Etc ! body count was better ! They then take the body to the morgue to examine what happened as usual the sheriffs department think the guy who witnessed the attack is crazy just seeing things claiming it was a bear that killed him ! What the f \*\* k !! They then go in search still think he 's crazy until they find a head of the man -LRB- slight difference -RRB- then witness the crocodile instantly believe him ! A Group of survivalist\/hunters come to help . They then make camp by the lake work out a way to try kill the Crocodile -LRB- s -RRB- But this time , in Lake Placid 2 ! There 's 3 crocodiles !!! To say the least , I liked this film abit better than the first , because it had more bloody effects in it -LRB- not really gory but good enough ! -RRB- as well as a higher body count ! Which if I 'm not mistaken was 8 people ! Unlike the first which only had a body count of 2 ! The CGI effects though were abit crap ! You could instantly tell the crocodiles were n't real did n't blend in very well ! The water plane was the worst possibly the best example of the CGI being cheap tacky ! I 've seen better effects in a cheap 90 's Horror Film ! Although it did n't so much mind the CGI blood I felt that was OK ! But the plane was just incredibly fake ! Even a 5-Year - Old could tell it was n't real ! The Crocodiles were OK but did n't have a realistic effect as the original did ! The kills were OK not the best but OK for a sequel like this one ! The usual kills when the 2 girls get killed by the crocodile the guy runs in foolishly shouting Whose there ! gets eaten ! Seen it all before ! Bit of a typical horror clich ! I liked how Mrs. Bickerman got what she deserved after she attempted to kill Kerri on the pier ! -LRB- Creepy Old B \* st \* rd ! -RRB- The typical teen-adults were typical as you 'd see in any horror film ! Stripping on the lake , skinny dipping , drinking beer etc ! Etc ! The ending was pretty good ! The sheriff got together with Emily Warner Scott who liked Kerri got together with her ! Overall I 'm giving this a 9\/10 for higher body count more bloodier effects ! Through I think the CGI effects were abit crap ! " ,9
" I liked it . While it certainly is not one of the best movies , I liked it . It provided laughs and frightened outbursts along with an occasional Oh my God . I think if you liked the first one you should like this one too . -LRB- and number three -RRB- This movie has plot connections to the first Lake Placid that were a plus and some of the people from the first movie show up here . For those who like the blood and guts , you will find those here too . We laughed a lot as we guessed who the next victim would be . When compared to the first Lake Placid , number two falls short as most sequels do , I have to agree but I did not find it disappointing as some reviewers did . I will watch it again . " ,7
" Lame and flaccid describe this sequel perfectly ... . I enjoyed the first film , it was atmospheric , very witty and had some great performances . This sequel is just bad , it tries hard to repeat the success of the original and fails utterly . The special effects here are incredibly amateurish and the crocodile is not very menacing this time around . The script is more cheesy than funny , flat rather than sharp and hackneyed rather than focused , while the story is unexcitedly-paced and unoriginal with the gory moments predictable rather than nail-biting . The characters are stereotypes and annoying ones at that , and the acting even from Cloris Leachman -LRB- whose performance is almost exactly the same as Betty White 's in the first film except White was far more inspired -RRB- is poor , an uneasy mix of overdone or non-existent . In conclusion , a lame and flaccid sequel to an entertaining original . 1\/10 Bethany Cox " ,1
" The Croc 's the star . Munch , Crunch , Gnash . . It 's funny that when I watch any kind of movie like this one , no matter how big and dangerous the animals are , I always feel sorry for the animals more than the humans . If you do n't take this movie too seriously , it 's a very cleverly made film re - the giant Crocs . The human 's were two a penny , but my favorite was the beefcake Sheriff , walking around the place like he was Matt Dillon in Gunsmoke . I have to say that thanks to the well created Croc 's munching their way through a lot of nasty stupid rent-a-gob , nice guys , I thoroughly enjoyed each mouthful , I could feel the Croc 's pleasure as it devoured several people , slurp , dragging one young lady into the lake . Yes the film was great fun , an easy 4 stars . More films like this would give me an even less appreciation of the human race than what I have gleaned over my experienced years on this planet . " ,4
" NoT bad ... . For the blind and deaf director and producer.Were they even there whilst making this ? Or did they ask the baker and the hairdresser to do it instead ? No wait . . That 's not fair for them . They would likely have done a better job ... But the acting was done extremely poor as well . I had the feeling they were reading an autocue instead of showing some real acting . But what to expect from our hero , his main experience was from the dukes of hazard . In short , I have waisted an hour and a half with this abomination of a film . You wonder why I have given a 2 ? Me 2 , I thought it was n't as awful as a 1 but after have written this I feel stupid I have n't rated as a 1 . " ,2
" Lake flaccid . A sequel and a remake , but inferior in every respect to the original . The two best recognized performers in this installment -LRB- Schneider of Dukes of Hazzard fame and Leachman , a once serious actress -RRB- are also the greatest shames . Schneider is a carbon copy of Bill Pullman 's easy-going , water of a croc 's back authority figure , while Leachman is essentially the same character as Bette White -LRB- in fact she 's supposed to be her equally quirky sister -RRB- . There 's nothing new in the storyline , and no surprises with the climax . LaFleur is enigmatic and as equally alluring as Bridget Fonda in the original , but her character is less dynamic , without the eccentricities that made Fonda 's character so appealing . Still , she 's definitely a big tick in terms of talent for the male audiences . Schneider has the best of the conceited dialogue , and there 's an occasional chuckle-worthy line to make you think you 're not wasting valuable minutes of your life . Unfortunately , there 's a lot of misery in this misfire sagging momentum , stilted continuity , drab score , amateur acting and staging , pretentious dialogue and visible errors , and so it 's surprising that it managed to secure the official sequel title , its predecessor , still regaled as a hallmark of the genre . " ,3
" Stink . For a Sci-Fi Channel production featuring a cast of has-beens and nobodies , this cheapo sequel to Steve Miner 's fun creature feature Lake Placid begins deceptively well , with some nifty gore -LRB- a juicy spurting stump where an arm used to be -RRB- and some gratuitous nudity from a couple of soon-to-be-croc-fodder bimbos . Lake Placid 2 soon flounders , though , when we actually get to see its terrible scaly monsters , which are rendered with such dreadful CGI that the film is rapidly dragged down to the murky depths and thrown into a death roll from which it could never escape . Dukes of Hazzard star John Schneider plays Sheriff Riley , the small-town cop who must do battle with the four giant crocs that are feeding on anyone who should venture down to the water 's edge at Lake Placid . Aided by tasty ex-squeeze Emily -LRB- Sarah Lafleur -RRB- , and a big-game hunter armed to the teeth with heavy-duty firepower , the plucky lawman sets out to bag himself some reptiles before they make a meal out of his son , who has ill-advisedly gone camping by the lake with some friends . Director David Flores ' unimaginative sequel desperately attempts to emulate Miner 's original , even going so far as to feature almost identical characters and narrative structure , but fails dismally on nearly all counts . Without a fraction of the original 's humor , and way too many REALLY bad digital effects , Lake Placid 2 is one hell of a bad film . Even the fact that the lovely Lafleur strips to her undies for an underwater swim is n't going to convince me to rate this one any higher than a 3 . " ,3
" So incredibly bad , its genius ! . There are no words to describe this film -LRB- actually thats not true as I 'm using words to describe it right now , but you get the idea ... ... or maybe you do n't ... . i shall explain ! -RRB- This film has absolutely no story to it at all , unless you class people being eaten by giant crocodiles a well written plot . It also has some of the worst CGI animation i have ever seen - the animation is so bad , it probably would have been a little better if they just used a 2D animated croc or maybe just a stuffed toy that they animated with stop motion . They 've managed to ram every clich in the book -LRB- 1001 clich 's : a clich guide for dummies -RRB- into the film , and of course lets not forget the bunch of annoying teenagers that always insist on camping on a site where its widely known a bunch of slaughters have already taken place -LRB- see , the much more expensive and better written , lake placid -RRB- This coupled with Sam McMurray -LRB- the bloke that played chandlers boss in friends -RRB- ridiculous attempt at an irish accent -LRB- when he remembered to do it -RRB- which sounded pretty much like an American with ... . er ... an American accent -LRB- he may as well have just used his normal voice and said begorrah at the end of every sentence , thats how bad it was -RRB- and John Schneider 's small town sheriff armed with not much more than an heavy artillery of sarcasm all add up to make a fantastic movie . If you enjoy -LRB- as i do -RRB- watching utter utter drivel , then this is the movie for you ! " ,7
" Recycled 80 's horror movie . This movie is a no brainier , its something straight out of the 1980 's horror movies . You just look at the DVD cover is enough to know what the plot will be . The director uses at least three topless models to pop up a rather boring story-line which is aim at teenage guys . There is the stupid Big white hunter , and its obviously what his fate is . The token black man who shares the same fate as the Big White hunter . There is the usual two main characters , a man and a woman who was once in a relationship , now are back together , so there is relationship . This is straight out of a 80 's story line . Whats so stupid , is this lake has a history of giant croc 's . Yet despite an a body is found in pieces , none of the main characters suspect a large croc maybe behind this , till the middle of the movie . There is no public warning either made once crocs are discovery either . When crocs are discovery , there is no talk of bringing in reinforcements outside either to aide operations . This movie , not as bad as the likes of Hills have eyes 2 is rather daft and nothing new , just a tired old recycled story line that any Tom Dick or Harry could think of . " ,3
" What in the hell were these people thinking ? . Lake Placid 2 , in my opinion , has to be one of the worst sci-fi films ever made on the face of the Earth . It is a waste of a person 's time and money . As a matter of fact , I did get around to viewing the first Lake Placid movie that was made all the way back in the year of 1999 . Personally , since it was , in fact a sci-fi horror\/comedy flick , I thought it was okay . Definitely not perfect , but okay nonetheless . Now , why on Earth anyone would ever want to make a sequel to it is just beyond me . The biggest regret I 've ever made in my life is watching it on the Sci-Fi Channel on TV because I wanted to check it out . Boy , was I ever stupid to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of my life that I 'll never get back . Here are my Top 5 reasons why this movie , Lake Placid 2 was so bad and should not be worth viewing . 1 -RRB- The actors . The acting is so atrocious , it 's not even funny . Hell , why would you even put John Schneider in a movie like this ? He did n't give a very good performance either as did all the other lame and pathetic actors in this movie . 2 -RRB- The plot . The plot is so unoriginal , it 's been done so many times in other movies already . This is it : A local sheriff must stop four crocodiles from wreaking havoc on a small town . 3 -RRB- The special effects . They try to make the crocodiles look like gigantic dinosaurs in this movie . Believe it , right into the beginning , one of the crocodiles is able to pull a man off a boat and right into the water . Then , when the man 's friend tries to help pull him back up , the crocodile comes in and eats him completely , just leaving out his arm and leg . So , basically , he eats the guy in just one bite . Give me a freakin ' break ! 4 -RRB- The action . Now , do n't get me wrong . A lot of people do get eaten and killed by the crocodiles in this movie , but overall , there 's very little action throughout and it can also get boring very quickly . 5 -RRB- The filmmakers . These people have done such a poor job on this movie , that not only did they embarrass the actors , but they also embarrassed themselves . Especially the director and writers of this movie . The dialogue was very corny , and sometimes I found myself having to turn up the volume because I could n't hear a word they were saying . Hell , even the director was making decisions of his own in this movie . It seems that every 5 or 10 minutes that pass in the movie , after someone has already got eaten by the crocodiles , then another person does , and then after that , another person gets eaten . So , it 's like a pattern where all the people get killed first and then the crocodiles get killed second . Good lord ! So , these are my 5 reasons why Lake Placid 2 , in my opinion , is one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made . I seriously do not know what these people were thinking when they made this miserable pile of crap . And get this , you think it 's bad enough that they already did one sequel to the first Lake Placid , they freakin ' made another one , Lake Placid 3 in 2010 ! And that one has also been getting bad reviews just like this one . I 'm not even going to attempt to watch that one , knowing how bad the people have been saying it is . Do yourself a favor , and just watch the first Lake Placid , and not any of the other poorly bad-made sequels . " ,1
" Pure dumb fun . I was pumped out when i heard about this film . Im a huge fan of the original Lake Placid , it was the first horror film i ever saw in the theaters . When I was watching the Syfy channel I saw the film 's promo , I was beyond excited when I heard that the sequel to one of my childhood favorites was being aired . From a technical stand point I did n't expect astounding special effects or a grade A story . When I finally watched it , I got exactly what i expected . B grade special effects , B grade writing and B grade acting . This film has laughable characters , effects and even genuinely funny moments . As a huge fan of Syfy channel original films and b horror films Id highly recommend . " ,10
" It 's so bad -- you might need to watch it just for a laugh . One of the worst disaster movies I have ever seen . Particularly as it was not supposed to be a disaster . The stilted acting , terrible timing , unconvincing ridiculous dialog , poor special effects , scene discontinuities , and plot anomalies make this train-wreck of a film laughable . It is apparent that the actors wish that they were in different movie from this one . Even the gratuitous topless nudity thrown in for a few seconds did nothing to lift this movie from the bottom of the list of worst movies ever made . If you are into masochism and have nothing to do for 70 minutes and need a good laugh this might be for you . " ,1
" Lako Placido Crocingo Duo . All right so this film is n't an opera . But it is n't Italian . But I 'm not . I 'm a bit of a crocophile . A crocoholic . And this is the best Crocofilm of the subcrocoflicks - the second drawer of crockery . CGI , while not top-notch like the original , sometimes comes close , and to me is never really bad but just off a few times . In LP2 : 1 -RRB- You do see a fair amount of the croc . 2 -RRB- And - I ca n't believe it - it is always in the day ! Though the real solidity is slightly lacking , and only once the beast enters sunlight - and it 's when it 's dappled ; that sucks . Sometimes the detail gets quite good , showing even the inside of the mouth . Sure the pointier , snappier wit of the orig is not quite there , but at least it has wit , with bite ! They do try much humor and I do n't think it all as sad as most others do . THE OTHER BOTTOM DRAWER CROCKERY See Supercroc of \*\* it -LRB- on the DVD extra , even the girl star said welcome to `` Super croc of ... '' then she went quiet and laughed I think -RRB- , where the nightly ghost croc is more lacking in detail . Bloody Blood Surf , that croc out where you never even see the whole croc once - see it walking , but just the rubber head or front part . And the better than these 2 , Primeval , with infuriating minimal croc action , always at night , and always spaztic . Now I 've just got ta see Croc , and I 'm complete . Rogue is top croc - budget wise , though not top croc drawer , and Black Water seems above C-grade too . That reminds me : I 've got a CA meeting tonight , in the day . " ,7
" bad , bad , bad . This movie is terrible . It 's ridiculous that some other reviewer gave this movie ten stars ; perhaps that person has some vested interest in it , I do n't and only gave it one star because zero was n't an option on this rating scale . The acting is consistently bad ; the performances are not at all realistic or believable . The dialogue is stiff and the attempts at humor fail . I 've seen better performances from chimps -- really , I have ; and , they were n't especially talented chimps either just run of the mill ones . I do n't like when movies go Hollywood ugly -LRB- i.e. the use of talented but ugly actors -RRB- ; I want my eye-candy -- afterall film is surposed to be visually entertaining otherwise it would be radio . But this is a movie , not modeling , so the actors need a modicum of talent . In this flick it just does n't exist . Of course the movie does n't just fail because of the acting . Failure here is much more of a group effort . So we need to recognize the lack of talent in directing , writing and even casting . When Schneider 's character quipped that the white rabbit was starting to annoy him perhaps he was thinking what the heck is a white rabbit doing in the middle of the woods in summer anyways ; it defies logic -- a white rabbit would be dinner way before it completed its second hop . It would have been more realistic to cast it as a chestnut agouti instead . But then on the flip side even though the white rabbit was miscast , its performance was more credible than anyone of the other actors ' performances , so maybe Schneider was jealous . Some of the other reviews indicated that this was a production for the SciFi Channel , and so they seem to give it some slack . But , each movie should stand on its own merit , or lack of it as in this case . " ,1
" pretty good . I thought this movie was pretty good the acting was alright i did n't see any bad acting the effects were great the crocodile is a remote control crocodile like the original Lake Placid witch is good bad effects is some times funny like Shark Attack 3 any way four giant man-eating crocodiles in the lake one is a female who has a nest the others are male crocodiles and the film replays the first Lake Placid apart from everything else i did n't like that it was not good but it was only the first 15 minutes which was good do n't like things like that my dad called this movie a shocker i think the first is the best but this a good movie crocodiles are one of my favorite animals 9\/10 loved it " ,9
" Tempting but do yourself a favor and pass on this one . I watched this only because it as a very boring TV night . It ended up being very predictable and all of the acting was really terrible . Especially John Schneider -LRB- Dukes of Hazard - TV series -RRB- I could n't remember who he was while I was watching this and actually came on here to try and figure out where I recognized him . That guy 's acting was so overboard it actually made me think this movie would have been better classified as a ` Comedy ' . The special effects were a let down but I did n't really expect too much since it was regular TV . I think classifying this movie as ` horror ' was a little bit of a stretch . If you saw the first Lake Placid you might be tempted -LRB- like I was -RRB- to actually stop channel surfing for a little bit and watch this one . Do your self a favor and just keep on surfing . This movie tried to repeat everything that you did like about the original but failed miserably and had no orginality of its own . " ,1
" Watch Out for Crocs ! . The most original aspect of the gawdawful Lake Placid 2 is they failed to come up with a catchy new play on title , such as Lake Placid Snaps Back ! This movie is so pointless , it 's almost to the point of not reviewing it . But since I wasted 1 hours of my life on Thanksgiving in some misfortunate desire to recreate Turkey Day from the old MST3k days , I 'll give my 1 cents to hopefully persuade you from the Return to Lake Placid . My thoughts : Ohhh , a sheriff and a called-in fish\/wildlife expert with a past ! A part one tie-in that also uses an 80s icon ! Breasts attached to D-model rejects ! The most apathetic sheriff of all time , James Riley -LRB- Schneider -RRB- watches strangers and colleagues and friends eaten away but still has time for snappy humor and melodrama ! A custody battle bratty victim with no cell reception ! A Matrix - follow-the-white-rabbit connection ! With scares intended for those under two or those so high every headlight outside simply must be the cops and with Windows ME laced CGI -LRB- hell , they could n't afford a plane , so even that was CGI 'd -RRB- we have a new group of idiots running around succeeding more at personal drama than trying to capture\/kill giant crocs invading the same lake where others met the same fate . They must use the only resource available , the non-coincidentally named Bickerman -LRB- Leachman -RRB- , sister of the late Delores -LRB- Betty White from part one -RRB- who carried the same tradition of feeding and co-existing with the large crocodiles . Gee , I wonder what will happen to her -LRB- who plays with fire . -RRB- Sorry , that was a spoiler but sh ^ t , you should n't have to submit yourself that far into this crap . Three years after this Syfy fifty cent sequel comes the 100x better Piranha 3D . At least that movie knew how to get both the When Animals Attack genre and tongue-in-cheek scenes down . Do n't waste your time here ; even if the beasts -LRB- or breasts -RRB- looked real and ha-ha , they certainly do n't , there 's not enough other substance to hold the feature . " ,1
" A feeble excuse for a movie . This is lame follow-up to Lake Placid . This time the acting is at best mediocre , the script awful and the computer graphics exceedingly poor . If the budget was a tenth of Lake Placid it is still a poor excuse for the production company . And not just the computer graphics is real bad , continuity stinks as well - daddy sheriff borrows a grenade launcher which he saves his son and gal with , but when they exits the wood minutes later it is just a rifle - how did that happen ?! Then in a few scenes later he has it again ?! And what about the topless gals - if you have no script , add a few nudes , so we do n't notice the other of the movie 's weaknesses ?!?! Anaconda is a masterpiece compared to this one - avoid ! " ,2
" Quite possibly the worst movie ever made , and I thought Showgirls was awful . . I am absolutely stunned that this movie actually made it to completion . You would have thought that somebody would have had the common sense to cease production early on , just for humanitarian reasons . I think I may be permanently scarred for the 60 minutes or so that I can never get back . I actually lost some brain cells by watching this . Awful acting by everybody , even the dog . Awful special effects - middle school quality . Awful dialog - grade school quality . This movie is truly as bad as you can get . The bottom of the barrel . I never thought ANY movie could come close to the horrific drivel in Showgirls but I was wrong . People , this movie is as bad as it gets . Everybody associated with this garbage should be shot . If you have n't watched this movie , do n't even consider it . Be afraid . Be very afraid . " ,1
" Worst.Movie.Ever . . This is far and away , one of , if not the worst movie I have ever watched ... I say watched , as I had to stop half an hour in as it was so bad , I could n't stand to watch any more ! I enjoyed the first one , but this was just absolute gash ; it seemed that they tried to copy the characters from the original movie -LRB- which was enjoyable enough -RRB- with newer , different versions - and they failed miserably . It seems that a lot of the movie has been dubbed for some reason -LRB- ? -RRB- and that the cast have been told to act as badly as they possibly can - which they have all excelled at spectacularly ! I ca n't deride this movie - and its terrible CGI\/Special -LRB- ! -RRB- effects enough . 30 minutes of my life that I 'll never get back ! On the plus side , at least I did n't watch it all !!! Shockingly bad ! " ,1
" This movie is the sequel to another movie . . In case you 're not aware , the original Lake Placid was a movie about giant crocodiles eating people in New York 's very own Lake Placid . Here we have the sequel , Lake Placid 2 , which takes place in Maine , in a lake that is not called Lake Placid ... but let 's not sweat the details . After the astonishing success of Lake Placid 1 , I ca n't blame the director for sticking to the plan - 5 minutes into the movie , we find ourselves knee deep in 40 foot crocodiles that have been raised by none other than the sister of the woman who raised the original crocodiles - talk about a family affair ! Honestly , I loved the movie - the acting was fantastic , and I could n't help but feel that I was right there in the action , watching some fool get eaten by a crocodile . And when the small town sheriff shows us all that he is an expert with an MGL Grenade Launcher , well , let 's just say I called up my local movie store and reserved ten copies . " ,4
" Unacceptable . The worst movie I 've ever seen , hands down . It is ten times more a rip-off of Lake Placid than it is a sequel . Director David Flores clearly did not go to film school , and the way his cast delivers their lines , you 'd think they were learning English for the first time . Not even Cloris Leachman tries . The first Nintendo games had more convincing special effects . Needless to say I did n't make it to the end of Lake Placid 2 , but you do n't need to watch more than five minutes to know that this is the biggest waste of celluloid in modern film . Do not let your love of the original tempt you to try this , even if you know it 's bad . It 's a turkey , no not even a turkey , it 's nothing . " ,1
" So bad it 's funny , but ai n't supposed to be ! . Today I thought I 'd give it a whirl and watch a sequel to a funny but quite thrilling and scary at times . I thought this would follow in the original 's footsteps but I was wrong ! The first thing I noticed was the painfully bad , stiff and empty acting from EVERY single soul in this movie ! They wander around a set that looks like somebody 's back garden and scream all over the place and chant irrelevant and childish comments that do n't add to the plot or character . The acting itself is so hammy , it almost resembles a 1950 's toothpaste advert ! The second but the most important thing which made me laugh but in two halves was the effects : its the 21st century and it made me feel sick to watch a computer generated crocodile super-imposed onto the screen so badly when movies in the 30 's had better effects than this trash ! Overall I did have some laughs with this film but for all the wrong reasons : 1 -RRB- Acting is beyond terrible and sets another all time low for future crap movies 2 -RRB- Special effects are not special at all and they look like they were designed and filmed by a bunch of college students with a 200 budget . 3 -RRB- It irritates me that in this day and age , people still make this drivel and why would they bother if they know they 're not going to do a worthy job of it . " ,1
" This was a HOOT ! . The acting was terrible . Presumably John Schneider was once talented , but he left it all in the dressing room this round . Sarah Lafleur , another of those attractive Canadian women , is n't too bad , but she plays too bland . Cloris Leachman is , pardon my opinion , too old . Lillian Gish could pull it off at this age , but not Miss Leachman , I 'm afraid . Everyone else seems to have escaped from middle school drama class . Maybe it was the directing ... The CGI gators are mediocre . I mean , they do n't look `` real '' , but they do look mean . And the script . Ah , the script . It seems they run out of stuff to say\/do , so they invent another gator . Even their `` keeper '' thought there were only three . But , the action never stops . The sheriff 's son , after a bad false start , turns out to have major cojones . There is never a need to fast forward through the ennui . And , although I do n't think they really meant it to be , this flick is really funny . It is a hoot . With a little more panache and pizazz , Schneider could have really hopped it up . Maybe it was the directing ... " ,3
" There is very little to like herein . . This Sci-Fi original is littered with the worst stereotypes , really really BAD acting , and Ian Reed Kesler 's moobs . -LRB- man-chest -RRB- Oy the moobs ! His chest is actually more ample than either of the gals ' . And this poor unfortunate actually appears on screen without a shirt ! I hope they paid him well for this public humiliation ! I knew soon after that it was time to turn the channel . I enjoy Brendan Gleeson in the original so much I HAD to watch this , as I almost bought it sight-unseen . I am SO glad I did n't . The problem is that every principal from the original film has been replaced by something lesser . Instead of Hector Cyr who is an intelligent character addition to the LP team , we have Struthers the Big Game Hunter and his big black hunter\/attendant . I think they actually did research to include as many racial and sexual stereotypes as possible . Compared to this film , the original is Oscar-worthy . And then there is the bad acting . I mean these performances are awful ! No one in here acts like they had a moment of training , experience , or talent . Unfortunately , John Schneider is piled in with these inept wannabes . I mean ... I wanted to like this , but in spite of John Schneider 's and Cloris Leachman 's involvement , there is VERY little to like herein . Horrible performances , terrible direction , inadequate film quality -LRB- M4TV -RRB- , the worst Scottish accent in the history of film , and the most inept CGI since Ang Lee 's The Hulk -LRB- 2003 -RRB- the render this production completely unwatchable . It DOES , however , make me enjoy the original all the more . I 'm SO glad I did n't just buy this on DVD . Ack ! BUT ... there are some good kills and if it 's splatter you 're after , you might actually like this . As nasty as this is , it just might find a niche with Creature Feature aficionados who also happen to be splatter fans . Giallo fans may also like this . So , there you are . It rates a 4.6 on the Made For Television Scale . It rates a 2.2 \/ 10 on the Movie Scale from ... the Fiend : . " ,2
" Lake Rancid . For a Sci-Fi Channel production featuring a cast of has-beens and nobodies , this cheapo sequel to Steve Miner 's fun creature feature Lake Placid begins deceptively well , with some nifty gore -LRB- a juicy spurting stump where an arm used to be -RRB- and some gratuitous nudity from a couple of soon-to-be-croc-fodder bimbos . Lake Placid 2 soon flounders , though , when we actually get to see its terrible scaly monsters , which are rendered with such dreadful CGI that the film is rapidly dragged down to the murky depths and thrown into a death roll from which it could never escape . Dukes of Hazzard star John Schneider plays Sheriff Riley , the small-town cop who must do battle with the four giant crocs that are feeding on anyone who should venture down to the water 's edge at Lake Placid . Aided by tasty ex-squeeze Emily -LRB- Sarah Lafleur -RRB- , and a big-game hunter armed to the teeth with heavy-duty firepower , the plucky lawman sets out to bag himself some reptiles before they make a meal out of his son , who has ill-advisedly gone camping by the lake with some friends . Director David Flores ' unimaginative sequel desperately attempts to emulate Miner 's original , even going so far as to feature almost identical characters and narrative structure , but fails dismally on nearly all counts . Without a fraction of the original 's humor , and way too many REALLY bad digital effects , Lake Placid 2 is one hell of a bad film . Even the fact that the lovely Lafleur strips to her undies for an underwater swim is n't going to convince me to rate this one any higher than a 3 . " ,3
" What a load of CROC . Wow ... I think my kitten could pass as a real live croc more than the things they have in this movie ! It was one of the WORST movies I had ever laid my eyes on . I am a valued customer at my movie store and they actually gave my money back lol . You know those movies like `` Meet the Spartans '' and `` Scary Movie '' mock movies ? Well , I think this mocks their own movie `` Lake Placid . '' The first one was GREAT !!! I think they just tried so so so hard to overdue the first one , but it totally blew up in their faces . They need to just do everyone a favor and take it off of the shelves at the movie stores ... and make room for a better movie . I give it an F - " ,1
" Very poor indeed , in fact pretty awful . The only good thing about this film is that it is a candidate for worst sequel ever . Bad plot , bad acting , bad cinematography , hideously bad special effects , this has it all . It looks like something that was knocked up as a college or university project , and got a 'D ' It is almost as bad as ` The evil beneath Loch Ness ' but not quite . Films this bad should encourage those who acted in them to go back to taxi driving , or hairdressing , whatever they normally do , as it does absolutely nothing for their acting career . Please take my advice , and do n't waste your money on the rental , and if it 's on TV , watch the commercials instead , you 'll find them much more rewarding . " ,1
" Bitter , Not Entertaining In The Least . I 've seen some bad movies , but this one , forget about it , no , seriously , this one , it was like a cookie made of salt ! that 's how I describe this wreck of a sci-fi channel movie ! The cast and crew should be tied to a chair , and forced to watch this movie for every single person that was duped into watching this flop of a movie that they so carelessly unleashed onto the innocent public ! The crocodiles were appallingly fake !! At least the crocodile in the first one was convincing , I actually cared about whether he lived or died , and that is saying a lot ! The crocodiles in this one lacked the realism , along with everything else that was supposed to make them crocodiles ! In more than one scene the so-called crocodiles looked like cartoons !! Whoever was involved with the CGI needs to go back and graduate the whole course at the -LRB- very , very , very -RRB- least twice !! As well everyone else involved in the script , directing , acting etc. . I know ten lines is the minimum amount of lines , but hey , I 'd need a hundred or more to fully describe how impossibly terrible , awful , , despicable , and heinous this movie really is ! But , I do n't want to waste anymore of my time talking about this , well , you get the point . I 'll close with this , you can waste your money renting this movie , but , if you do , and you hate it , you will not get your money back , even if you win the lotto , you still will not get that same money back that you spent on this , or you can spend your money to try and erase the thought of it from your mind . " ,1
" How could this been made . I was excited -LRB- even not too much -RRB- to see this sequel . In the end I had preferred even not knowing about the existence of it.When I saw the name of John Schneider I thought it could have been watchable even for a TV flick . Nothing was more wrong . Anyway , at the first place the visual effects are so bad ! Important for a SF film.The acting is n't that great but quite acceptable over all . Here they wanted to show us the ferocity of the crocodile but with such -LRB- pore -RRB- effects they had done better showing us a little less cruelty of the monster.It has a wrong turn to it . I 'm not used to give such a low vote , I always try to see if there 's something to save -LRB- I gave `` Jaws 4 '' 1 but just changed that in a 2 -RRB- in a work.Here it is impossible to me . " ,1
" Wait , this is a comedy right ? . Well , my friend was having a party a few days ago and i was at the movie store deciding what movie to get for the party . At last years party , we watched the original Lake Placid . We all thought it was hilarious ! So I rented this and we all watched it-and laughed all throughout . There was not one scary part throughout the whole movie , but there were plenty of funny parts . That 's the only reason i gave it a 3 . John Schneider was hilarious ! His laugh was probably the most annoying -LRB- and hilarious if you 're in the right mood -RRB- laugh I 've ever heard . Then the other actors were n't good . The plot was almost identical to the first one , unoriginal . The actors were n't good . The only good part was the funny stuff . Overall , it 's entertaining-but in the wrong way . 3\/10 . " ,3
" A laugh inducer the first time . For the sane there is no second time . . All in all the exact same story as the first , only with three more crocs aside one . Exactly the same type of bunch of characters , only this time with lesser budget and less dedication to the roles let alone repeating Jaws in the process . Exactly the same type of gimmicks to get people eaten , only repetitive . And even worse CGI effects , including a water plane when the budget did n't allow a real one for fricken authenticity . Even the detailed crocodile dummy is really just a rent from the first production . So is there anything new ? Well , yes , a bunny . That 's right , a bunny with a hilarious sound effect , just about the highlight of the flick . In it 's essence the exact same repeat of `` being eaten '' this genre has been repeating too long to survive . So what should the unwary expect from this ? Nothing , absolutely nothing , because the types of people who enjoy this stuff are either socially left behind or unhappy with their lives , or both . One thing is clear , rubbish like this wo n't make those lives any better , because happiness comes from better things . Who am I kidding , the horror genre is a nothing more than a fossil nowadays . If you catch this from some channel be prepared to observe excrement for the sake of seeing the worst CGI of this century . If you think of renting it , do not . It is n't worth renting and even channel viewing might be too much . This movie is a mockery of serious reality , reality it can not replace without consequences . " ,1
" Has none of the originals charm . I am quite fond of creature features and I am a huge fan of the original Lake Placid . However , this outing is nothing to get excited about . It is a merely a re-hash of the original with poorer characters , a much lower -LRB- and obviously so -RRB- budget , no wit or charm . It starts off well , I was actually willing to ignore the poor special effects if there had been a good story to back up the film , but unfortunately , there was nothing . This film could have easily been a sequel to the ` Crocodile ' series , if it had n't been so clearly trying to rip off the first instalment . One wonders why they actually bothered to make it at all . It 's painful when you realize that the largest amount of research done for the film is probably read aloud by one of the characters in a slightly condescending tone . I think I could have picked up more information from a Puffin Book . I have tried to look for positive things to say about the film , all I can say is that the actors are n't bad , its s pity they had such a poor script to work with . Rather than wasting your time with this film , just re-watch the original . Or if you want to see a slightly cheesy crocodile movie , watch Crocodile 2 : Deathroll , instead . " ,3
" No crocs in this lake . I am afraid that I must join the barrage of people who abhorred this movie . I knew , or just assumed when I pick this up that it was going to be lightweight . I was not expecting Shakespeare for the creature feature but obviously I was expecting something . Sad to say I did not get it . John Schneider was inept as a Sheriff and should have taken his job more seriously . He lives in an area where giant crocs where destroyed and he does not keep a watch on his area or on that sweet little old lady who fed them . Granted she got eaten but was there not a few bells that went off regarding her sister ? And what is with his deputy who did not even close the lake ? And he was going to hit her with a dart . Sacking her would have been better . Of course we have the usual half naked women frolicking in the water . They died too quickly . And the girl who went out with the jock . Why ? He was an agro twerp who needed a chill pill , and so stupid he could not recognize a giant egg belonging to some sort of predator . Did he not live there and therefore know about what was in the lake , or maybe he just did not listen to his parents warnings , if they gave him any . And what is with the girl , If that was my dog I would be worried , but not a mention of Daisy until she showed up . The so called Great White Hunter was a complete waste of space and the death I felt sorry about was his assistant\/slave\/go get guy . He should have lived , as he was one of the best ones in it . Cloris was great as a crazy old woman and although she was demented or just overly fond of crocs , she came to a sad end . So if you have not seen either flick , watch the first one but spend the money for this one on more chocolates and popcorn " ,2
" A daily comment from Midget Emma : Lake Placid 2 -LRB- 2007 -RRB- . Bad movie . Terrible main character , horrible cgi and boring at times . The only reason it gets a 2\/10 is that it made me laugh a few times . This is the worse predator goes wild movie that i have seen . Not even worthy of TV . What were they thinking casting John Schneider . Terrible main character . This seemed like a job for The Rock . John Schneider was n't tough enough sure he tried to be but it did n't work . Cgi was horrible . It was like looking at a cut scene on a Playstation 1 game . This is definitely not worth watching even if you loved the first movie . Terrible . I do n't recommend it . 2\/10 " ,2
" More crocs , less filling . I went into watching LAKE PLACID 2 with bargain basement expectations and got what I paid for ... literally and figuratively . This sequel waters down -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- all of the merits of the original and ups the ante -LRB- more crocs , bigger body count -RRB- , but ultimately it accomplishes nothing more than seeming like a back yard remake . Every character from the original is represented here with a pale substitute . What really bothered me about the movie was that each characters demise was met with a creepy indifference . Even if I 'm watching a cheesy flick with giant crocodiles ripping people apart , a little humanity goes a long way . Another sore point was the CGI . I know this is low-budget and all , but if your movie is about killer crocs , it helps if they do n't look like they just stepped out of a PC game . It 's not a completely rancid movie and would serve as an okay diversion if you ca n't find anything else to watch , but if you 've seen the first LAKE PLACID , there 's really no point in seeing this one .

" Lake Placid 2 . When I heard about this movie I was kinda thrilled . I really enjoyed watching the first movie and I had high expectations for this one . It only took me 5 minutes to realize that this was a big mistake . The acting shocked me , as it was nothing but pathetic . That they would make a second movie and make it a pure B-movie disappointed me . The special effects were even worse than Jaws III . The story -LRB- not what happens -RRB- is basically the same as the first movie , having replaced the old `` kind '' women with her sister , most likely because the original actress did n't want to be seen in a movie like this , which I do n't blame her for . I have n't been this disappointed since I watched Predator 2 back in 2003 . Do n't watch it . It 's a total waste . " ,1
" Terror has returned to the lake . . This sequel is more comical that terrifying . CGI has its moments , but not many .

A stunning Fish and Wildlife agent , who happens to be his ex-wife Emma -LRB- Sarah LaFleur -RRB- , joins in the search of the lake . Things really get wild when a professional big-game hunter -LRB- Sam McMurray -RRB- has his sights on capturing the big ass croc . Nobody really knows how dangerous the situation is except for the crazy little old lady Sadie -LRB- Cloris Leachman -RRB- who knows the toothy predators have multiplied . Afterall , Sadie is the one that lives for her long green `` babies '' . These cow fed monster crocs would love to consume the whole town ... a chomp , chomp at a time .

" Poorest film I 've seen in quite a while . This was the worst movie I 've seen in a while . The out of shape and out of form Schneider was something to behold . The best part of the whole movie was when the girl dove in the water in her underwear . I quit watching the movie as I thought it that bad and I 'm a big movie watcher . This had to be the worst sequel ever made . The crocodiles in this movies were in my opinion , as fony looking compared to the first ones that I 've seen in a while . There was really `` NO '' acting or show of any `` real '' kind of emotion when confronted with the beast . If trying to improve on the crocodiles , they did not succeed in my opinion and should have stayed with the original beast . The beach scene with the kids was not believable at all . I think people off the street could have done just as good a job of acting as went on in this film . " ,1
" Unnecessary Sequel . This sequel essentially recreates the first movie , with less appealing actors and more CGI crocs . Other than giving the Skiffy Channel filler for an `` All Croc '' day movie marathon , what was the point ? John Schieder , who looks pretty good considering it been 30 years since Dukes of Hazzard , plays the Sheriff in the town the first movie happened in . Amazingly , no one remembers the incident a few years prior with the giant crocs . Cloris Leachman plays the sister of the Betty White character , who takes to feeding the babies of the crocs from the first movie . Obviously , they watched the first movie but did n't learn anything from it . What made Lake Placid a good movie was the characters , not how many people the crocs ate . -LRB- I think that only one person was killed in Lake Placid , as opposed to about a dozen killed in this one . -RRB- " ,2
" lake placid 2 . I loved the first movie.The dry humor and effects were fantastic.This one ? I would n't even rate it as a 1 . if given the choice I would rate it somewhere around -40 . Why oh why would the original writer of this movie ever allow such a piece of rubbish like this to be produced?I will be sure to look out for movies directed and produced by these people again ... to make sure I do n't waste my money or my time buying them to watch.personally i think watching paint dry would be better entertainment.I have been left feeling totally cheated by this excuse for a movie.I can only advise anyone who has not seen this one but has seen the first . . Do not watch it !!!! it is one of the biggest disappointments I have came across in the movie world.The acting was wooden , the special effects ???? lets just say I am no computer genius but even I can produce better on my pc.And to think I wasted money on popcorn too thinking i was in for some great frights and laughs .

" worst movie ever made . First off , giving this movie a 1 implies it has some credit of being a watchable movie . It is not . To give you an idea of how bad this movie is , I never sign up for these comment boards , but felt it was necessary to do so for this movie . This is the first time I have ever done this . After 5 minutes , I watched this movie in fast forward at 30x speed , only slowing occasionally to laugh at the special effects not even worthy of a high school film project . They must have had a budget of like a hundred bucks . The cast is probably the directors drinking buddies , and I am pretty sure that you can purchase the very same alligator they used floating around in the lake at Walmart . It is a pool floaty toy . This movie is far worse than any bad sci-fi channel movie I have ever seen . I 'm not sure how more than one copy of this movie made it onto the shelves at Blockbusters . If I paid the $ 4 or whatever to rent this -LRB- i belong to their unlimited movie pass deal -RRB- I would have really felt cheated and probably would have demanded a free rental , or at least some friggin popcorn as compensation . The only good thing about this movie would be to copy it , give it to your friends and tell them it is really good , and then laugh when they bitch about wasting 2 hours of their life that they wo n't ever get back .

" Makes a good comedy . I do n't know why , but when I was renting movies , something just bugged me about seeing Lake Placid 2 , most horror sequels are crummy , but I figured how bad could Lake Placid 2 be ? I saw Wrong Turn 2 a little while back and I could n't believe how impressive it was , and the first Lake Placid is decent , so I just wanted to see what Lake Placid 2 would be about . So now that I 've seen it , I want to thank the writers very much for the good laughs I had this afternoon watching this movie . I just could n't believe , I mean , it was like Jaws 2 , only it was really bad . The crocodile looked incredibly fake , not just like , `` oh , that 's fake '' in a snobby attitude , it 's really bad CGI and was incredibly lame . They involved teenagers , horny teenagers , that could never be a good thing . Sheriff Reily has a big problem , a big , big , big problem in his Lake Placid . There is n't just one crocodile in his lake , there are 4 ! He 's in big trouble and needs help to capture these croc 's . But when his teenage son heads out to the lake with a few of his friends , things go bad , the crocodile eats their topless friend , their cocky jock , their obnoxious pervert , and what are they going to do ? It 's just madness , and now they have to deal with another lady who is feeding people to the croc 's , sound familial ? It should , it 's the first Lake Placid with horny teenagers . Lake Placid 2 is a joke , I 'm not saying that with a sarcastic attitude , just how are we supposed to take this movie seriously ? The acting was beyond horrendous , the story was extremely unrealistic , and the effects , I could do better with my lab-top at home . I 'm so sorry that I gave the director , the writers , the actors any money by renting this film , just please , please , I 'm begging them , stop it with the film making , this is just horrible and I really recommend that you just stay clear of this trashy sequel . 1\/10 " ,1
" Another Sci-Fi Original ` winner ' . Sci-Fi original : two words each on their own merit are very positive , but put them together , as in ` this is a Sci-Fi Original ' is enough to bring utter disdain to the most open-minded viewer . Visions of horrid CGI , crappy acting , and extremely sub-par scripts immediately come to mind . This sequel to `` Lake Placid '' -LRB- the first one was n't a sci-fi original , so was n't AS atrocious -RRB- , does nothing to dispel those feelings . As the gators are laughable and even the seaplane is CGI . The acting is appalling and the script is n't at all better . Only worth watching to be laughed at , ridiculed , and openly mocked . Eye Candy : Yana Marinova , Zhasmina Toskova VJ Kewl all get topless DVD Extras : 2 four minute featurettes -LRB- ` sex , guns , and Croc-n-Roll ' ` Surviving a Crocodile Attack ' -RRB- both worthless ; a 9 minute ` gnawed up ' version of the film -LRB- speeds through the movie , only playing the croc and babe scenes at regular speed making a MUCH better watch -RRB- ; and Trailers for `` Bachelor Party 2 : The Second Coming '' , `` Wrong Turn 2 '' , `` Sunshine '' , `` Ressurecting the Champ '' " ,2
" Not the worst movie in the world . I have seen more awful presentations by the SciFi channel . A lot of the time the special effects are lacking , and the acting is n't the best in the world . However , I did appreciate some of the humor in it like the return of Mrs. Bickerman -LRB- her sister but they share a lot of the same views -RRB- and her love of the crocodiles . It was certainly not the worst waste of my time . There was a very amusing speech about the fact that a guy could n't fly a plane and had failed three flying tests . Also amusing was the Kissing rhyme . I really would have appreciated a little more character and special effects development . Also a little more better acting . " ,3
" Lake Placid is Putrid Definitely one of the worst sequels ever . This is just a bad movie period . From bad CGI crocodiles to rehashed storyline and characters , only this time it 's not just one but four crocodiles Even when the film makers use model alligators they look fake -LRB- think Jaws 3 when the shark is swimming upwards towards you -RRB- . I guess the only redeeming features of this crap fest are Cloris Leachman who in the end gets what you are all expecting and one of the original Dukes of Hazard . There 's even a CGI plane that mysteriously disappears from the dock only to appear again later . Save your money re-watch the far superior original or if you really have to rent , rent Alligator or Jaws instead . " ,2
" Big let down ! . this movie was a let down . It was not even half as good as part 1 . there were several bloopers in this movie and they are very easy to spot . For example the boat pulls up to the dock with the deputy and the seaplane is totally gone but later in the movie they use the plane . Another is when he looks for his son he has a grenade launcher but when he comes out of the woods he only has a shotgun . I would only rate this movie as a 1 . I would not recommend this movie unless you like really boring story lines . At least Lake Placid 1 made sense.It actually had suspenseful scenes . This one just had flat out stupid scenes and was the nudity really necessary ? " ,1
" A lame attempt to make a sequel , sorry ! . Although it was great to see Bo Duke back on the scene , it was a poor attempt at recreating the magic and terror of Lake Placid One.Cloris Leachman is always a delight , but her role as Betty White , s follow up character did not suite such a talented actress.The CGI was way too obvious as well as the lead characters UNDER acting and lack of any believable response to the fact that they just watched their close friends devoured by the CGI Menace.adding more crock 's did n't do much to grab my attention either , i was very disappointed.the one thing that did surprise me was the lack of a sex scene that movies like this turn to to try and keep us interested , but in this case i do n't think that would have helped either .

" Excellent production for the SciFi channel . I thought this film was rather well done as far as a SCIFI channel production goes . You have to admit that when compared to the majority of SCIFI channel films , this one does stand out . I do n't understand the previous comment of , Not Worth The Time . To each their own , I guess ? Anyway I really enjoyed the film myself . Crazy Sadie was pretty comical in her role and there was more blood shown than usual in a SCIFI production . The trailer reads , 3 crocodiles when it turns out there are actually four ? An oversight or intentional ? All in all the story line is weak yet the special effects and bloody scenes make this one a pretty decent flick . Besides what do you expect for a made for television film ? SCIFI channels best production so far this year I believe is , Pumpkinhead 4 . " ,10
" Sci-Fi Saturday - where Hollywood writers go to die . The Sci-Fi channel . Despite having some really good original TV series , I always think of the network first and foremost as the `` Disaster\/Monster B-movie network '' . Even its documentaries are blatantly science fiction . That may come as a shock to some people , but dude , you CA N'T find a crystal skull with a metal detector ... I only watched this movie because I was bored and I have a more than passing fascination with archaeology . I do n't normally watch Sci-Fi Saturday . Now , as a writer , I understand that ideas are a dime a dozen , but I also know that we 've been out of ideas pretty much since we 've had the ability to HAVE ideas . That said , I understand the similarities to The Librarian and Indiana Jones , but COME ON ! Do n't make the hero of this movie dress IDENTICALLY like Jones ! That 's just taking the similarity too far ! I applaud the idea of a female hero , but do n't make her so gung-ho about guns that she admits they 're her `` security blanket '' and continues using them after realizing time and time again the hard way that the monster 's completely bulletproof . I can also understand the need to draw in the young adult demographic , but having the tweenaged girl be a complete genius and outthink the adults in almost every scene smacks of badly written Mary Sue fanfiction , especially if the concerned father seriously makes such a stupid decision as to take the kid into the heart of the war in Iraq -LRB- wearing bright pink no less -RRB- , let alone repeatedly exposing the kid to an invulnerable monster when there 's a perfectly good hidden sanctuary where she 'd be safe . There 's a reason why we have satphones , people . As for the writing , the movie was so completely predictable , it 's hard to come up with a suitable adjective to describe it . " ,1
" Bad bad bad . The delectable Dina Meyer and the normally competent Lochlyn Munro co-star in this turkey made for The Sci-Fi Channel , about archaeologists unleashing an unkillable monster from an Egyptian tomb . Meyer looks great in black leather and shooting two guns at a time a la Tomb Raider Lara Croft while Munro simply looks like an idiot in an Indiana Jones hat about two sizes too big for his head . The movie goes nowhere once the monster is unleashed , which happens about five minutes in . At times , the creature looks like a poor man 's griffin ; at other times , it morphs into a bad copy of Inhotep from the first two THE MUMMY movies . The dialog is from hunger , as is the acting . Other than tuning in to get a look at the beautiful Meyer , this one is best skipped . " ,3
" Fair for SciFi , Bad for anywhere else . A hacky pastiche of Indiana Jones , Lara Croft and a little of `` The Librarian '' , with mediocre acting , a non-sensical script , and a shape-changing sphinx who is alternately mediocre CGI and laughable human . While not as truly vile as some of the SciFi channel offerings , there is little else to recommend this . You could find a worse way to waste two hours , but you would have to try . As usual , everywhere in the world -LRB- Greece , Iraq , etc. -RRB- look just like where the movie was shot , in this case Canada . The sets are either obviously something else -LRB- power plant standing in for secret underground base -RRB- or so minimal -LRB- burned out 50 gallon drums for Iraqi war zone , a few Styrofoam pillars for Greek ruins -RRB- as to be distractingly laughable . Everyone continues to shoot at the obviously bulletproof monster , and if you ca n't guess who the traitor is I hope your babysitter did n't ruin it for you . " ,3
" Typical Sci-fi Channel crap . . No surprise - about what you would expect from a third rate network . The budget was probably whatever the limit on the producer 's credit card was . All of the typical clich s for a poorly written \/ directed \/ acted project that looks like it was done by a bunch of film students over a weekend in Vancouver . -LRB- Yeah , we noticed that Egypt , Greece , and Iraq all look a lot like British Columbia in the fall , cough , cough -RRB- The only real surprise is that someone with the talent of Dina Meyer would agree to participate in this kind of garbage . Yeah she looked great , but come on , put any physically fit 40 year old actress in an outfit inspired by Laura Croft and they will too . Need the work that badly eh - what a shame . A big waste of time and pretty sad considering how many other potentially decent projects did n't get bankrolled so this waste of film could . " ,1
" Pull out a picture book sometime . . I could n't take this movie seriously from very early on in the movie . The CGI department , or whomever was giving them instructions , obviously did n't know what a sphinx looks like and decided to go with a strange looking griffin instead . Even I could tell the difference between the two creatures while I was still in grade school . The acting was fairly poor . The make-up department should never be hired by anyone ever again . The bald guy looks like his head was shaved the day they stared filming and make-up never even tried to blend the skin tone . The script was pathetic . I 've seen some bad stuff on SciFi and this is one of the worst . The male lead just comes off as corny while the female lead is normally a much better actress . The little girl suffers from the Wesley Crusher syndrome . People do n't like this so why do they keep using it as a plot device I will never understand . " ,2
" Dino Meyer is decent , the rest of the movie is bad . Watching Riddles of the Sphinx with little else to do , I was anticipating little and got almost nothing to write home about . Dino Meyer is a sexy and decently charismatic lead . However when it comes to redeeming qualities that 's where Riddles of the Sphinx ends . The sets look minimal and nothing to done to make them interesting , and the costumes were reminiscent of the actors having had a fantasy-adventure movie fancy-dress party -LRB- or even about to have one -RRB- . The editing is choppy and the effects particularly with the monster of the title are hopelessly cheap in quality . The script is aimless and filled with unfunny lines that were no doubt meant to be witty , and the story is structurally thin , unoriginal -LRB- if it was trying to pay homage to Indiana Jones it took the homage to extreme levels that it feels like a rip-off instead -RRB- and has no excitement whatsoever . The characters are badly-written clich s -LRB- SyFy clich s in alternative to genre clich s -RRB- with none of them likable or developed enough . I was especially irritated by the girl who seems to be cleverest of the bunch , I 've seen that plot-device before and something about it always annoys me . The rest of the acting apart from Meyer suffers from the writing and characters , Lochlyn Munro is an especially unconvincing hero . Overall , with the exception of Meyer Riddles of the Sphinx just did n't engage . 2\/10 Bethany Cox " ,2
" Poor and unconvincing \* 1\/2 out of \*\*\*\*\* . Riddles of the Sphinx -LRB- 2008 -RRB- which I saw on the UK Sci-Fi Channel Today out of boredom more than anything , is clearly a homage -LRB- Rip-off -RRB- of Indiana Jones , Right down to the Main Character 's job as a College Professor and his choice of clothes complete with Indiana Jones style Hat . . The biggest problems with this is the dire acting and totally unconvincing performance by the lead actor The budget is VERY low as most of the ` action ' in filmed in front of not-very anonymous Backscreen ... as The Filming ALL took place in Canada and There are only 4 characters in the entire Film ... So the ` Double Agent ' is obvious from the get go ... I 'm a big fan of these types of Adventures , but this badly needed more money spent ... and as a result my rating is low . \* 1\/2 out of \*\*\*\*\* " ,3
" Once again why SciFi Channel Why ?? . Is there any way you could just FIRE your writers , directors and casting director ? They need to be told they do n't have any business being in this business . The actors did n't even seem convincing , so either this is because they are just that bad OR the director does n't know how to help anything . The beast did n't look good in the least bit either . I really do n't understand the continual monies filling the coffers to waste film on these productions . There are better stories , better heroes and better music . Terrible drudge . Waste of time is what my 13 yr old boy commented to me about this movie I am using that term loosely here . Someone needs to seriously get someone new to head up the programming for SciFi , someone with the ability to tell someone no when they hear a bad idea . I 've seen B-rated movies that are better than this , B-rated movies that SciFi channel PLAYS on it 's channel . Why do n't they take some pointers even from those movies and you know ... strive for that ? " ,1
" Seasonal discrepancies . Not the worst movie ever , but not even mediocre . Set at beginning of summer break , yet the season is quite obviously fall . Although I 've seen both leads in other films that were fairly good , this one really leaves good effects and acting behind . The story is old , the filming is discount and the graphics moderate at best . Once finished , it may be that you feel dismay at never getting those two hours back . Life 's too short for films of this caliber , so go throw a ball with your kid or take your spouse to dinner . Many activities would be less a waste of time . The music gets at least a four out of ten . All in all , good movie to throw on in the background while you 're cleaning out your laptop files . " ,2
" still have n't seen part of it . When i saw the preview for this last Saturday , i thought it was going to be a stupid mummy horror film . What i got was a future Indiana Jones story . Acting was alright for this , music was cool . I find it funny that he was dressed up like Indiana Jones , when there are supposedly in Greece , which is was probably just shot in a wooded area in Indiana or Canada , he was acting like Indy . That probably was the aim for this movie , and this is a rare treat , for those who like horror and comedy rolled into one . This has the potential of a Indiana Jones movie , too much actually , solving seven riddles to get rid of some transforming bird , -LRB- actually a gryphon most probably , it looked like one -RRB- . The jokes kinda wore off , not real funny , it sounded like he was trying to be funny . OK movie i guess , i still have to see the other half of it before i make up my mind . " ,7
" Great concept but still nothing special . This film aims to showing the discrimination against homosexual people . The writers show a reflection of the current world were straight people are the minority and are considered to be perverts . A bit of exaggeration in the way that straight people were treaded in this fictional world , something that does not reflect in the real one where gay people have a lot more rights . Great idea and generally a good movie but with some scenes of poor acting from `` Sofia '' and `` Yiannis '' . It is though a nice film and it is worthy for anyone to watch it just to watch the writers ' perspective supported by the great roles of `` Petros '' and `` Stefanos '' . Enjoy . " ,7
" Very well made . When I first read the premise of the movie , I thought it would be similar to the film Almost normal , which had a great idea but a not-at - all good realization . That 's why I was really pleased with Straight story . The writing is excellent and very funny , and it does include basically every aspect of what makes homosexuality problematic in the current society - the homo\/heterophobia , the bars , the hiding , the violence ... Since the film is technically a parody , the acting is funny , especially Sofia stands out . All in all , a very good and relaxing movie . " ,8
" Genius concept , whoever thought of this is a genius . . I laughed the whole time while there was a tragic element into it . Like the old Greek tragedies . It was about time for someone to come out with a movie like this and remind a society like the Greek one that is time to wake up and be with the rest of the world . No wonder it was the best seller movie of the year , everyone went to see it including the closeted cases with their wives . A culture moves a step forward with bold moves like this like releasing such movies . The acting could have been better but the reality is this movie hit the nail in the had . Had the people talking about what is normal after all . Therefore this movie is groundbreaking , i highly recommend it . In Canada where i live gay coouples can marry , adopt children , go to the supermarket holding hands , talk to the kids ' teacher and this is normal . It is time for Greece to move to that direction as well . A democratic society goes ahead not with the things that devides us , but with the things that unite us . Kudos to the ceators of the movie . " ,10
" An amazing depiction of diverse reality between two `` different '' traditions inside the Greek Modern Society . The film is extremely funny if you possess the ability to laugh ... or at least have a sense of humor . Excellent production - excellent still photography . Excellent roles with appeal to every taste sexual preference and age . Not offensive to the Gay audience not sarcastic towards the Straight audience . A huge commercial film for Greece but with equally high quality in plot - roles - and to top all that a magnificent original music soundtrack by C : real ! Funny balancing the message with humor . At the end we realize that all the happily married couple of Mouriki and Kuriakidis wanted to say to the audience is that racism has no face and we must give love and accept love with examining the other 's sexual orientation ... as Epicures said thousand years ago ... `` It is not the things that upset people ... but the peoples ideas about the things '' so the message here is clear and it is amusing to ... free your mind `` and as here '' the rest will follow . Enjoy an 8 + " ,9
" Very good , very funny . Great movie that had me laughing the whole way through it ! The actors for really well in this , and the star form the hit TV series `` Maria is askimy '' is very very good in this film . Great mix of comedy , irony , romance , and sex . A must see ! Keeps you laughing all the way through , with Yianni and Sophia having some very good moments between each other and her girl friend making that even funnier , not to mention Yiannis mates making the film just as funny . A very funny scene when he has to try act gay . From what I understand the majority are metria names in the big screen but after seen this im sure they will be big names in the near future . " ,10
" What a mess ! . At first the idea of of a world where `` gay '' is normal and `` straight '' is `` perverted '' seemed silly but interesting . A few minutes into the film you start to think `` why am I wasting a minute of my life on this rubbish ? '' . The story is so contrived and the alleged acting by everyone is so wooden it almost defies description . It 's been a long time since I have seen such poor performances . The movie has no idea what it wants to be - social comment ? comedy ? farce ? drama ? and fails miserably in every aspect . The ending says it all for the whole storyline - a complete and total disappointment . I really think that all involved should be ashamed of this abysmal piece of cinema and I doubt if many involved would want to show it on their CV for future work . " ,1
" Straight to the garbage story . Even though the idea is interesting -LRB- a society where the Gays are the majority and the straights are the exception -RRB- , the implementation of this subject on the movie was awful . Characters without any cause of existence -LRB- the two fathers , the `` funny '' friend of the boy etc -RRB- , a REALLY NAIVE plot , caricatures who scream all the time without knowing why -LRB- it is supposed to be funny in Greek movies -RRB- , and a very bad approach lacking any comedy characteristic . I did n't laugh at all , and at the end of the movie I felt like an idiot -LRB- the end is VERY-VERY naive -RRB- . At the pros of the movie I only add the photography and the good production . Do n't see the movie and waste your time like I did . " ,2
" disturbing . As a Greek I have to say that if this is where Greek culture is heading , then Greek culture is in very serious trouble . The characters are wafer thin and the plot is a 95-minute extension of one joke that was n't funny to begin with . Yiannis is a straight man in a gay world , who secretly goes to straight clubs and has fallen in love with a gay woman . On the surface it seems the message of this film is that when you reverse the roles ` gay people are just like straight people ' , which would be perfectly fine if : a -RRB- it were true that all people are alike b -RRB- society was progressive enough to have reached such idealistic levels Equally objectionable is Yiannis ' ` seduction ' of Sofia . Basically he gets her drunk and sleeps with her and upon realizing her confusion , kisses her until she ` turns straight ' . Though this certainly is n't the first film whose would-be couples are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts with nothing in common , this oral assault sequence that uses ` love ' as a justification is something I find frankly disturbing . I ca n't begin to explain on how many levels this movie is wrong . Just because everyone is gay and the straight people are in the minority in this warped ` comedy ` does n't make sick bigotry any more acceptable . When you re-invert the premise , fundamental biases in the ideologies of directional\/writing team become patently obvious . Is prejudice OK when the oppressed become the oppressors ? Is being gay acceptable ` as long as you act just like everyone else ' ? That 's what this movie is trying to assert and it 's not a happy feeling . " ,1
" Worst Acting EVER ! . Made myself some microwave popcorn in anticipation of watching this movie after seeing the 7.9 score . However , turns out that this is a huge disappointment . A 16 year old media student could do better acting than this . It 's so obvious that all the lines are memorized , the acting and speech is not natural at all . There are also no facial expressions . For example a man about to die speaks with the same volume as the other guys . As a result I stopped watching this after 20 minutes , I could n't bear it anymore . I wo n't even talk about special effects which are terrible but seeing that it 's a low budget I wo n't comment on that . However , the acting is what ruins this movie and deserves a score of 0 ! " ,1
" Do n't Bother . Reading about this movie it sounded like a decent little action flick but I was n't expecting it to be this bad . Poor acting , Poor script and bad directing . I was really disappointed with this , given a decent cast and a decent script and someone who can direct then it would have had the potential to be a good all round film . It could have been one of those films thats really good even without a big budget . The camera angles are terrible and the acting was truly terrible , a really shame . The effects where bad and poorly done , the stunts were n't that bad , at least it looked like some professionals were on the set , hopefully the food was better too . I ca n't Begin to put into words how bad this is , its long , drawn out intro of the film and then a rushed ending really spoiled it and made it hard to watch as it became boring within the first 20mins . After 30mins I could feel my eyes starting to close , it was putting me to sleep . If you have some time to waste then watch paint dry , its more entertaining than this film . " ,1
" Is this a comedy or something serious ? I ca n't tell . . It lists A Clay Brothers Film as if that will mean something . Who you may ask are the Clay Brothers ? I 'm not sure . One , the co director and star John Will Clay was , according to IMDb a volleyball coach in a Hannah Montana movie , a Sailor in Deja Vu and an uncredited groomsman in Elizabethtown . His brother 's credits seem to be only this movie . Neither their credits not this film make me think that they 'll be the next big thing anytime soon . The plot of the film has a computer programmer getting the code key for a prototype weapon that was stolen by terrorists . The terrorists need the key to set off the weapon and so the chase is on . Low budget film might have been something had the script been better , the directing more imaginative and the performances better modulated . The film is such that it looks good and actually reasonably professional -LRB- and trust me I 've seen a great deal of bad looking films lately -RRB- but there is no clear indication as to whether the film is serious or not . Take for example the scene where star John Clay is grilled by a policeman after bringing someone to the hospital . The dialog is incredibly silly in that its of the Dragnet just the facts style of writing . Adding insult to injury is the performance of the actor playing the cop who seems to be mugging to the camera . Clay is n't much better since he seems to be reacting to a scene that is playing in his head and not what is going on in front of him . I was n't sure if I was suppose to laugh or feel tension Actually I did neither and reached for the remote in anticipation of needing it for a rapid exit . This is just a silly movie . -LRB- Its also a film that feels like its a glorified home movie with all the friends and family being brought in to be part of it -RRB- . Its a mess . To be honest I think the heading over the title should be changed from A Clay Brothers Film to THE Clay Brothers Film since I 'm not sure that there will be another . " ,3
" Like watching a high school `` theater arts '' assignment . The premise of the movie seemed interesting , so I gave it a watch . Unfortunately , the acting was so horrible that I could n't focus on the movie . This movie will probably stay in my `` worst 10 '' list for a while . Why ? The acting is beyond bad - all of the actors exhibit delayed , awkward , or incorrect emotions in almost every scene . It seems like the director\/writer could n't figure out whether they wanted a drama , comedy , or tragedy - so they mixed it all up . It 's a really awkward film with bad directing , acting , and plot . Some movies are so bad that they 're funny , but this movie is just painful to watch because it 's bad but tries to pretend like it 's not . In short , it 's the first movie we 've watched where my fianc has said `` We can turn this off if you want - this is horrible . '' If you want to see what a movie would be like with no real plot and bad acting and directing , by all means watch this movie . If you want to be entertained , however - stay away . " ,1
" It 's hard to imagine a worse movie . . Most of the other reviewers have it right , but no one mentioned the inconsistencies . Here 's a list . 1 : There is a disk that will be used to set off or turn off an atomic devise and it has to be encrypted before it will work . Apparently any method of encryption will work . It might make more sense if an unencrypted disk was needed . 2 : When the main guy is handcuffed behind his back and not tied to anything , he apparently believes he needs to get un-handcuffed before he can make his break . 3 : Similarly , when the girl has her hands tied and mouth taped , that seems to be enough to keep her from trying to escape . 4 : The nuclear bomb is blown up with a smaller bomb to disable it , but no one seems to worry about radiation and there is none reported 5 : The bad guy wants to blow up a large Colosseum with gobs of people in it so that he can sell the plans for making the device to other terrorists . Are plans what is needed for any terrorist to make a nuclear device ? Would n't detonating almost anywhere be as good for advertising purposes ? 6 : When our hero tries to get the water out of the lungs of the lady after going under water , his first attempt seems to be to exert pressure on her neck , not her chest . 7 : When they use a card to break in on a Saturday in a highly regarded information center , there is no one on guard . You just need the entry card . Meanwhile the bad guys find a way in without a card . It 's never shown how . These were just the things that jumped out at me during the playing . I 'm sure that if I were to see it again -LRB- not a chance -RRB- and looked for the problems , I could double or triple the list . So , if someone ties your hands behind your back and puts tape on your mouth and makes you watch this movie , just walk away . " ,1
" what is this ? . I am really amazed how bad acting can really be , I guess that is an art too ... You could not make it worse with the old form of Russian synchronization in movies , where every role is spoken by one -LRB- male -RRB- person and every sentence begins with he sais or she sais ... Or wait a minute , is it maybe a new form of comedy ? Is there a secret award for the worst movies - this would certainly make it to the top . I still really have no clue what it is about , a bomb attack on what by who and what for and ... ugh , what is the matter with all the dialogs in the movie ? Even first graders have a better vocabulary . But one has to admit , it is really hard to forget such a movie and you could n't stop watching it either because you just ca n't believe what you see .

" Could become a cult film - enjoyable fan film type movie . . Hey , give these guys a break . OK , it 's not Die Hard 4.0 , but if you consider that it 's the first effort of a small group of independent film makers , who wrote , produced , edited , scored , and everything else , it was a truly outstanding effort . Good plot , and funny acting . Remember how stiff the acting was in the first Star Trek -LRB- TOS -RRB- movie ? Wrath of Khan was the next one in the series , and it was maybe the best .

" who is that girl ?? . I am not joking when I give this movie 2 thumbs up . The star of the movie in my humble op ion was the actress who played Sarah . According to the movie credits her name in Ashley Morgan . I found her performance in this feature to be nothing short of Oscar worthy . . I ca n't wait for the sequel , I hope there is on . . Ashley was an absolute scene stealer . I found myself routing loudly for her character . I honestly found this movie very entertaining , I found it accidentally when go ogling the movie Inception . I now have seen both movies , and dollar for dollar I would rather watch Interception every time . I mean , I still do n't understand the plot of that first movie , I do n't know who was asleep and when , or even why the characters kept going to sleep and dreaming more and more dreams . At least , I could follow the plot in this movie . I bet dollars to donuts , Ashley Morgan goes on to become a famous actress . " ,10
" When I watched this movie , the first thought was Stupid Americans . . In fact , anyone who saw this silliness , was unscrupulous cheated .

I agree with all comments before me - there really can see cheap , poor acting , ugly script , plot and bad directing . As I said - stupid Americans . If you have some time to waste ... Yes , I agree with Do n't Bother , 17 January 2009 . This is a huge disappointment for everyone , who spend his money to tickets or DVD rent ... You must sue Clay Bros. .

" Easy going , comical romance . In the mold of the traditional ` Pride and Prejudice ' romance . This adds a little extra character depth and a number of excellently crafted comical moments all wrapped around a fairly simple plot of ice lady meets lost , passionate artistic man . Entertaining and real . Nothing new , just nice to smile through an hour or so of your life . Matthew Modine takes on the role of the forlorn architect desperate to show he can disprove his ex wife 's opinion of him as the eternal dreamer . He plays the comic moments very well with his easy smile . Mich le Laroque in the first English speaking role of hers I have witnessed takes the aloof ice maiden model and gives it a light comical edge from the first to the last as she is slowly warmed ...

" This movie is great ! . I have been watching new movies all summer and just happened to read the box on this new arrival to the video store and thought the plot sounded funny . After watching it I was more than pleased . I could watch it over and over . Perhaps the people who posted a comment before me need to be soon fed a plot to be able to understand a movie . When the 2 main characters kiss it is obvious that even though they have been fighting with each other for however long , that they have technically formed a friendship and he is so depressed -LRB- obvious from the beginning -RRB- and she is completely unsatisfied with her current relationship -LRB- obvious from every scene with the fianc e and lunches with friend -RRB- ... well ... I think the movie is completely believable and I wish it did n't have to end . I am going to be adding this movie to my collection . " ,10
" Lame , Oh so Lame . I have given myself a day to calm down before ` voicing ' my critique of this shoddy film . What happened to the terrific Matthew Modine ? So much of it needed editing . The contrived situations , the change in mood , the ridiculous outcome ... why ? Could have been a fairly decent film , if only someone with brains would have stepped in and watched the dailies . Pitiful . Example : if someone is a teetotaler , they have ways to refuse taking a drink . Chug-a-lugging wine , just to bolster ones nerve , is extremely juvenile , and not in character for our leading lady . Why resort to gym shoes , when dancing barefoot has been the norm for hundreds of years . -LRB- Not that the wedding was even formal , which is another atrocity -RRB- . Nothing jived . Scrambled nonsense . Only satisfying moment was when her selfish fianc e exited her life . " ,1
" A very bland movie , fails at the romance . . Well . This is a not well-known movie , and initially , i was surprised at the low rating it got at IMDb . But then I still went ahead to watch , and i was wrong . The movie is interesting only to the first half , then it begins unleashing the crappiest elements of a romantic comedy . First , there is a sense of realism and the movie attempted to shape the characters of the two main leads . We can see , from their never ending arguments to the lifestyle that they have , how different the two are main leads are . Both of them have major flaws with their characters , but nevertheless , remains quite likable . Then , comes the climax of the movie . They fall in love with each other . How ? In what way ? There is no plot line , no events that will lead them to even change their views of each other at this point of time -LRB- half the movie gone -RRB- and seriously , there are such little chemistry or sexual tension between the two leads that I for one , even though knowing that this is to come , still ca n't quite imagine them falling for each other . And before long my doubts are cleared , they are brought\/forced together in a very unconvincing and awkward way . There must be divine intervention really for the two of them , with their characters to behave like they did . From then on , it 's all very rushed and the characters of the main leads seem to change overnight -LRB- especially for the female lead -RRB- . Why shape their characters up if you 're going to ruin it so completely later on ? For romance ? A very awkward and forced one ? NOTHING is convincing . This is a terrible movie . Even if you 've got a couple of hours free with nothing to do , do n't watch it . " ,1
" Just watch this . . You may agree or disagree with the vision this documentary exudes . I certainly thought the steps taken where a bit rash at some places . I do agree however , with the message which is given as a whole . Regardless of what your opinion is on current day socio\/economic\/political society . This documentary is of such outstanding cinematographic quality , that it just can not be ignored . It looks like they went through all the pieces of film of the last 4 decades to make this ! And the use of sound is simply astonishing . I usually loathe the ` leading ' documentary , like Michael Moores cheap propaganda I just refuse to watch out of principle . However , ` What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom ' is very direct and conscious about it guiding the viewer . To redeem itself it simply contains so much facts and correct historical reference , it does n't become a ` mockumentary ' . If you do not agree with the vision that we are all trapped in a system of numbers and targets , just see this film document as you would a riefenstahl . Commend it on it 's graphical excellence supported with great sounds , a vicious style and sublime directing . See it anyway if you like -LRB- political -RRB- documentaries . If you are a person that does connect with the message this document conveys : Try to see it as soon as you can and be enthralled . " ,10
" A sensible examination of the ideas of freedom . . Much like his previous work , THE POWER OF NIGHTMARES , Adam Curtis ' THE TRAP takes an intriguing and complex idea , the idea of freedom used by western governments , and expands it to three superb and detailed episodes , that looks how this idea has been developed , through cold war strategy , American psychiatry , political ideology and eventually to the Blair government and its use of free market ideas and target strategy 's in public services . There is a lot to talk about , but all i would say is that , you need to watch it . If you want to watch a series that questions the state of things in the world and allows an intelligent and sensible argument as to how we have fallen into this false sense of freedom , that has led to the rise of social inequality and the disastrous attempt to establish democracy in Iraq , which has led to a rise in violent factions in the country itself and the rise of the threat of terror attacks in Britain , Europe and America , this series will draw you in as it is both revealing and eye opening , and the sort of intelligent documentary film making that we need more of . Naturally what sounds like a subject that may seem boring to some on paper , is perfectly handled by Curtis , who inter cuts talking head interviews along with a mountain of archive footage that is funny , revealing and disturbing . This is essential viewing . " ,10
" The fifth step down the rabbit hole , the blue pill . As he researches each new movie , you can hear folks whispering in Adam Curtis ' ear , `` That 's OK as far as you went but this is what is the underlying philosophy is about '' . Like any good series , while each stands on its own , you will get more by following Curtis ' entire path down the rabbit hole starting with `` Pandora 's Box '' to `` the Mayfair Set '' `` the Century of the Self '' and `` The Power of Nightmares '' -LRB- research to collect the names shows more , but I have not managed to find them -RRB- . At each step along the way , he has long interviews with the actual people , stating plainly what is well understood to be their positions , so it is hard to lay a claim of subterfuge , or twisting of facts . The spoiler if there could be one is that while a dichotomy grew up as a discussion about `` Positive vs Negative Freedom '' the discussion was one sided and delusional , and in the end based on the mathematics of the brilliant but paranoid schizophrenic John Nash , whose beautiful arithmetic had only one flaw , it only worked if everyone was at least as much a brilliant paranoid schizophrenic as he was . Despite much research that demonstrated that the results were in error , the math was so compelling that an entire Ideology grew up around it . As much research published elsewhere on the web -LRB- Google Authoritarian RWA SDO -RRB- has demonstrated , RWA 's are very attracted by the comfort of easy ideology , and SRO 's are very attracted to anything that will attract RWA 's , and that same research has shown that this is always a bad thing . Perhaps I jump ahead of Curtis here and suggest the next movie he should do , but it is directly in his trajectory . In reading and in part a response to IMDB-5601 , his response has many classic RWA examples . Curtis makes a point about the flaw noted above , and gives examples of research that demonstrated the fallacy . Googling the points above will give many more examples . As to the origins of Islamist extremism , his previous `` Power of Nightmares '' dealt with that in great detail , but as he points out , the Iraqis were never a part of the Islamists and were hated by them . And despite the invasion might have made a go of it had the extremists in the Bush Administration not tried to play Mad Scientist and experiment on them with their Social Ideologies , that failed utterly , creating the expected reaction of an outraged populace , thus opening a place for the Islamists to come in . On the home front Curtis makes the point again that the Ideology is destroying both Freedom , and the Economy , and ultimately Civilization itself , and will not be stopped without a clear understanding of the complexities that were understood , but have been discredited in the rush to fit everything into the narrow Ideology . My own Blog at http:\/\/freedemocrat.blogspot.com\/ follows many of these intellectual threads and offers a vision of an alternative to the Neocon Ideology that is not the classic `` liberal '' ideology though most progressive ideals end up in the results . Mostly it does this by addressing a central flaw in Libertarian logic . " ,10
" Is this title going to be released on DVD ? . I think this documentary series should be release on DVD , along with Curtis 's previous series `` The Power of Nightmares '' . I found them both very interesting , but the ideas are sufficiently convoluted and arcane to require several viewings . Please release them , BBC ? Apparently I have to leave ten lines of text as part of this comment or it does not qualify . So perhaps I can continue by saying that this program left me feeling quite unsettled - a bit like watching a David Lynch movie - but made more potent because its all probably quite true . I say probably , because one can not be entirely sure . But it all makes rather a lot of sense , and not to suspect that there are people who spend their lives trying to figure out the perfect system for a stable and obedient society is like saying the military are not working on invisibility techniques , or cloning , or ever more effective bombs . Of course they are . " ,10
" Unsubstantiated assertions unsupported by any facts . . This series proposes a pair of arguments : That -LRB- 1 -RRB- the principles of Game Theory applied to domestic policy resulted in a loss of freedom and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the same principles applied to foreign policy , specifically in Iraq , caused Islamic extremism making the West a target for terrorists . The second thesis contradicts historical facts . The invasion of Iraq took place in 2003 . The destruction of the World Trade Center happened in 2001 . The first attempt to destroy the same complex using a giant truck bomb , killing and injuring several , took place in 1992 ! The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards took the 50 American hostages in 1979 . Regarding personal liberty and the effect upon it of Game Theory , the argument is advanced via two tactics : avoiding difficult questions and the assertion as fact of contentions without evidence . The film-maker repeatedly asserts that a central assumption of Game Theory is the self-interested behavior of individuals . It is repeatedly asserted that this is a `` bleak '' vision , as though that bleakness were itself sufficient reason to reject it . Never once in the entire series is it asked whether this bleak vision is or is not correct ! It is as though in the mind-set of this film-maker and his intended audience the mere undesirability of a thing is sufficient reason for us to regard it as not true ! This is , indeed , instructive . It does explain a great deal about the behavior and posturing of Western `` intellectuals '' who endorse freedom and the revolutionary pursuit of the liberation of oppressed and minorities yet who consistently support those movements and institutions that most obstruct such trends : previously the Soviet Union , today reactionary Islam . As far as asserting facts unsubstantiated by evidence , the series contains numerous examples but one , in particular . It is asserted as a fact that a result of the widespread use of objective assessment and diagnostic criteria in psychiatry is that an entire generation of people took to applying such tests to themselves and as a result presented for psychiatric treatment of their behavior . Thereby producing a self-imposed conformity effect . The only support for this assertion in the series is an anecdotal comment by a psychiatrist , in his office , that this was his personal observation . This clip is shown twice in the series . No other support for this contention is offered . A contention , easily contradicted . Ask yourself , have you ever set yourself a formal diagnostic test for psychiatric disorder and gone to a doctor as a result ? Do you know anyone in your family to have done that ? Have you ever heard even indirectly of any person in your wider circle of associates who has done that ? Have you ever before heard of such a thing at all ? I have observed psychiatry throughout the entire three decades that the claim applies to . I have never come across such a bizarre assertion other than in this series . If I try to argue the case for the assertion , I can only imagine that it refers to one of two things : The popularity of quizzes in magazines along the lines of `` Take this months test to find out if you are a workaholic '' . Or the widespread phenomenon of the `` worried well '' who present at therapy for the treatment of non-existent conditions , in effect , life 's dissatisfaction . As far as the latter goes , it has been known for about a century that such `` worried well '' form the multitude of those who seek `` therapy '' . Such behavior has nothing whatever to do with either objective diagnostic criteria or Game Theory . Nor do such clients but rarely alter their behavior in any significant way . On the other hand , pop-quizzes of a self-questioning kind have been popular for almost as long as the kind of magazines that they appear in . A long time before the emergence of objective diagnostic criteria in psychiatry and owing nothing to either that or Game Theory . I do not know if these are what the film-maker refers to but they offer no support for his contention that Western societies have become in some way self-straight-jacketed by conformity as a result . It seems , rather , that this is merely what he would like to believe , and hopes that by asserting it boldly , repeatedly and each time quickly passing on to something else , he will like an after-dinner illusionist convince us that something has happened that in reality has not ! Only in the last few minutes of this series is any alternative vision to the `` bleak '' contention that Human behavior is self-interested offered . It is that we ... may ... instead ... assume ... and act upon the ... assumption ... that Human Nature is capable of change ! Not only is this a major contention , offered as an assumption without any supporting evidence , but it implicitly concedes that there is substance to the `` bleak '' contention , such that an `` alternative '' is warranted , whilst yet again dodging the real issue : is it or is it not true ? The `` retro '' montage of archival material is edited for the most part according to principles of affective consonance or non-rational association . Images are mainly matched to the narrative according to the associations that they evoke , rather than to illustrate facts . Typical is the repeated use of a pairing of reference to post-war ideals of personal freedom with what appears to be a snippet from a film of housewives at a workshop for jive-dancing from about 1965 . Why ? The function of such a technique is to massage the viewer into the acceptance of assertions whilst de-potentiating rational engagement . It is like the `` programming '' scene from `` The Parallax View '' . The effect is the unpleasant sense that the film-maker is attempting to make us accept that against which we might otherwise be guarded . Replace that monologue with a sound-track of dance-music and the program would look little different from that one-time staple of late night viewing `` The Trip '' . " ,1
" Linking Memories . In my book of references , Manoel de Oliveira has an unique approach to cinema . And that is because of two aspects , which show vivid here as few times before in his career . Most viewers -LRB- specially the Portuguese -RRB- will stand on a like\/dislike position based on the immediately visible `` flaws '' : - the dialog , which is old fashioned , inadequate in practically any moment , out of context , definitely not cinematic in the vision we have today -LRB- and have had for many years -RRB- of what a film dialog should be -LRB- sound ? -RRB- like . This dialog constantly explains -LRB- too -RRB- many things , in devices to provide the spectator with information on dark areas of the plot which many times are so denounced that become childish . - than the acting , which is many times just awful , and other times more melancholic and over-dramatic than the speeches of say `` gone with the wind '' . If you , dear reader , think you are smart because you detected all this , you 're not . it 's all true , and i do n't care about any of that . And i do n't care , because of two things : The first one has to do with `` placement '' . Oliveira is a true master in the way he `` places '' things in his films . He places vision , his camera is most of the time still -LRB- not that much in this film , actually -RRB- . That has to do with his conception of cinema as filmed theater , but i really see in this the ability to summarize , and tell a mood\/dialog\/sentiment just by looking at it . Antonioni tried similar stuff later in his life , but Oliveira is a master in this . A curious note is that here , his sense of visual placement is strangely -LRB- to Oliveira 's patterns -RRB- close to what Antonioni might have done . The camera moves a lot here , and i call attention to the scenes in Alentejo , the road shots . One of them , in which the eye of the camera is not on the road , we watch for some moments the camera following the car . This way of shooting a landscape placing an action in it , which becomes fundamental though shot at distance , is something Antonioni did so well . Check also the placement of characters . They always start a scene walking , coming from somewhere and stop in determined positions to serve the placement chosen for the camera . So it 's not about how the camera found the characters , but how the characters serve the camera . In the very beginning we have an interesting shots alternating up down angles with low up angles , in Lisbon 's Terreiro do Pa o. The second aspect i truly enjoy has to do with Oliveira 's very personal way of working with layers of reality , fiction , and fictionalized reality . The peak of this exploration of layers was in `` Viagem ao princ pio do Mundo '' , which i place on a special list of films i truly believe can change something about you after -LRB- and while -RRB- you watch it . There we had a layer of fictionalized reality -LRB- that of the actor -RRB- , an historical account -LRB- portuguese past political context -RRB- and the layer of Oliveira 's memory . Here he replaces the fiction for the real story of a real couple , and layers his own personal layer on that couple . He gets more economic here , but `` viagem ... '' was far deeper , visually and in terms of narrative . Let 's check it here : we have Manuel Luciano -LRB- who by happy coincidence has the same first name as our director -RRB- and we have his wife . They will serve as a motive for a kind of road\/travel film . They search the clues leading to a supposed retelling of the origins of Cristopher Columbus . Though creating around Columbus a strong theory , that may also be fiction over reality . Than we have the third layer . Oliveira plays Luciano as an old man -LRB- and his grandson plays him as a young man -RRB- and has his wife playing Luciano 's wife . I personally feel that Oliveira at a certain point was shooting mainly this third layer . So we have a number of scenes , with Oliveira and his wife in close shots . They talk . I do n't think they 're acting . I think they 're being themselves . Like in Sunset Boulevard , we are constantly inside and outside reality\/ies . One of these shots is worth mention : they both seat on an interior . They talk about their past lives , i think about their own lives , not the lives they 're performing , she proclaims her love for him , he answers he loves her , and he kisses her on the face . They get shy like two adolescents . He is 99 . She is 10 years younger . This has to be one of the most poignant love scenes in the story of cinema , and the climax of this good film . The scene alone makes the experience worthwhile . So , superficially -LRB- to my view -RRB- the film is about the retelling of an historical worldwide known biography , following with that purpose the lives of a couple who studied the subject . In a deeper meaning , this is about `` connections '' . It 's about linking subjects , themes , places , and specially memories . That 's why the story talks about linking loose points , unexplained historical issues . The separated shots here are also interlinked . That 's why we have a shot looking at the sea in Dighton corresponding to a shot looking at the Atlantic in Porto Santo ; or shots looking through windows in several places throughout the journey . In one particular shot , a bridge is being crossed in Alentejo , an iron bridge , we have a shot at all close to what Oliveira did with bridge D.Luiz in `` douro faina fluvial '' , this is his own cinematic memory . Vision ... Memory , Love , Luciano loves his wife and his research , Oliveira loves his wife , and cinema ... My opinion : 4\/5 should this be put together in a more united way , and the acting\/dialogs not be so badly thrown in some moments , and this could be something to change your imagination . Oh and the music is great . http:\/\/www.7olhares.wordpress.com " ,9
" It 's all about Portugal . I was n't expecting much of this movie , not that it was an Oliveiras ' , I really respect his work , but because of what i read about it . He had this story he wanted to tell and made a decision about how to do it . A risky and brave decision . It 's not made to please a massive public nor the artistic cinema lovers . It sometimes looks like a thesis presentation or a documentary with perfectly shooted scenes . It 's a journey that takes you along with a couple in the quest for the true nationality of the man who discovered the American continent . And an appeal to keep fresh in our memories the golden age of Portugal 's history . For those who say that looks artificially due to the unnatural dialogs , you 're right . But it 's suppose to . The characters talk to you through the screen telling you that the world is small , finite and theones who first notice that where the Portuguese . I think that was thepoint of the movie . And for that matter , the cinematography was amazinglycontextualised . A Portuguese movie about Portugal , by the main reference of this country 's cinema . And if you were born here , you should watch it . " ,7
" Look ! It 's a Manoel de Oliveira movie ! Oh yeah ! It 's boring as hell ! . This movie is bad in every single aspect . Actors , direction , script ... Many people think that this is a good film ... for what ? For the director . yeah yeah good ... Oliveira is 103 years old , so for that he is the best director in the world . The Portuguese cinema is not this crap films ... If you want to see Portuguese movies , you have two options : first : you are mad and you have to go to the doctor , or second , watch the old Portuguese movies . At least , they are enjoyable , happy ... this film , my God , it 's the worst movie I have seen until today ! If you like cinema , the real cinema , that the actors , the director , the script are good and the movie is enjoyable , do n't watch this . It 's a complete waste of time . " ,2
" A documentary about the truth on Crist v o Colombo . This film , as many on Manoel de Oliveira filmography , was made on a small budget , and it shows . Nevertheless tells a story based on a investigation that proves Colombo was Portuguese . Under a secret mission -LRB- working for Portuguese crown -RRB- trying to create a diversion for Spanish . Whilst Portuguese were making huge profits from the India maritime route -LRB- through South Africa -RRB- , and knowing South America richness -LRB- gold , wood , and many other valuable goods -RRB- , Spanish were sent on a -LRB- supposedly -RRB- wrong direction . Bad luck -LRB- or not ?!? -RRB- they found new land . Carabean islands including Cuba . This is what makes it all interesting : this island was named be Colombo wish ; why ? Because there 's a small village in Portuguese Alentejo , named ... you guessed : Cuba ! And there are also investigations showing this theory has every aspect to be right . Of course , Portuguese XVth century intelligence tried to delete all traces to Colombo genealogy . And there is no interest -LRB- Spanish and Italian -RRB- to investigate this theory deeply . That 's why Colombo is still and hero claimed by many -LRB- Spain , Italy and USA -RRB- although the truth is probably a completely different story ... " ,8
" Movie made to pay the Director 's vacation . The movie has terrible actors . Even young actors from the Portuguese soap-operas are better . Well , when most of actors are from the family , the best actors from this movie are then the American secondary actors . It is more than obvious that this movie was made only to get some money to pay the holidays of all Oliveira 's family to USA and Madeira . The sound is awful , as well as the image . A kid could do a movie with a better argument . In the end , everybody becomes convinced that Colombus was n't Portuguese with again terrible arguments ! The movie can not has 1\/10 , since it has still one funny part : `` Oh Silvia ! ... '' when the old actress -LRB- director 's wife -RRB- forgets her lines . A terrible pseudo-nationalist movie , as a old men 's crank . " ,2
" Watta ya mean , upward ? . This independent film has everything to become a big hit ... a solid storyline , driven from the book by the same name , that leaves you both amused and disturbed at times . A good soundtrack that leaves it 's mark , but does n't overpower the art and dialogs . Amusing characters that you ca n't help but sympathize with , and finally , beautiful artwork that has nothing to envy to Hollywood productions , as it does n't distract your attention from the story itself . Reading the book beforehand is not necessary , but will definitely help you catch on to the story faster , as you will not sit there wondering what 's up with these wacky Flatlanders while an important part of the plot is revealed . A must see ! I highly recommend it . " ,10
" This is why independent films are better than standard Hollywood fare . . If I had a dollar for every time I walked out of a movie theater griping about how Hollywood has run out of ideas , I 'd be a rich man . Lately I have been on a spiritual search if you will , to find some truly unique movies and Indie films seem to be the grail . Flatland was an impulse buy for me and I must say that this was the most unique movie experience I ever had . Nothing I 'm aware of is more thought provoking for people who like discussing UFO 's and Inter-dimensional travel . I ca n't think of a genre this film fits into . This is a thinking person 's film and since I 've seen it , I 've been trying to explain to my cat what a solid is . I 've also named her `` Pea Brain '' . You can bet this film will get some serious looks from the big movie houses . " ,9
" Review of Flatland : the Film . Back when I was in the 6th grade my Dad gave me a copy of the book . I 've read it 2 or 3 times over the years and always enjoyed it . I ordered your movie and recently watched it . I totally agree with the reviews you have received from Film Threat magazine and SciFi.com . You did an excellent job of updating the book to be more relevant for today 's audience . The movie was incredible . I loved the character design , dialog , action , and music . Great job ! The animation is engaging and completely different than the typical CGI films today . I would highly recommend this film to anyone . I wish you great success on this and future projects . I 'm looking forward to your next one . Thanks and good luck ! " ,9
" Do n't get too comfortable in your own space ! . Literally . Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott was a little gem of a book which could not be pigeon-holed into a specific genre over a hundred and fifty years ago and as a result ended up on Science Fiction shelves . Combining Geometry and Philosophy -LRB- and even Religion -RRB- , it was an allegory on the human condition , describing a very rigidly-structured Society where square pegs aspired to fit through round holes . The plot focuses on A. Square , who is led to a series of epiphanies on the Nature of Reality itself to the realization that not only is there an existence beyond his two-dimensional plane in the form of a 3-dimensional universe , but that further dimensions are implied . He learns that appearances are not necessarily all they seem . Difficult to conceptualize in its reading , Llad Ehlinger , Jr. has managed to graphically express this evolution of the mind . Despite these worlds being populated exclusively by geometric shapes , we are drawn into the story and feel A. Square 's transformation as though it were our own , which it hopes to be . Flatland itself is appropriately extremely two-dimensional , yet has endearing qualities . From our hero 's perspective , he is at first confused , then exhilarated as he is lifted into the three-dimensional world . We are taken along for the dizzying ride . This is only the beginning for A. Square , who then postulates other worlds with both less and more dimensions . Ehlinger has a sequence which can only be an homage to 2001 : A Space Odyssey as multi-dimensionality is explored . As if this were not a big enough task to tackle , Ehlinger expands the storyline by applying some of the original concepts of Governments to their logical path to War . Flatland , both the book and the movie , can be appreciated at many levels . By adding an extra layer , Ehlinger has actually simplified the book . I enjoyed this movie . It is mind-bending and thought-provoking , with a graphic element integral to its message . A potentially too-heavy treatise is lightened by very humorous details , such as the warbled battle cries of female lines in Flatland , who need to both sway and make noise at all times in order to be seen when not approached from their sides , so as not to pierce unobservant polygons ! There is more than meets the eye to this unusual independently filmed and marketed movie . One viewing may not be enough . " ,10
" fun , thought-provoking , dimensional hybrid animation . For the Limited Edition DVD-R . This film was leagues more interesting that I expected it to be -- my girlfriend REALLY wanted to see it , though . Lay back , sort of sleepy , watch the film . Some early on-screen direction annoyed me but it did n't last far into the film . I 'm not familiar with the book , but this film is a helluva lot of fun and it brings about some great self-questioning about the perception of consensus reality . The creativity expressed in the various worlds was quite amusing . And it 's mostly a family film but there 's some language kids might repeat the next day at school -LRB- and get in trouble -RRB- and there 's some very strange violence :-RRB- Well worth a shot , though .

" How soon is Flatterland coming out then ???? . flatland has always been a magic book for me , as math itself although I was never VERY good at it . My average ability as an engineer to comprehend the mysteries of both the world of science and the social sphere , were given a true boost with this magic allegory . I purchased the film two times so far , one for my husband and one for a friend , and each time I watched it it revealed something new . The animation , I find it superb and the storytelling brilliant . Just brilliant . I only wish there were subtitles to it , as English is not my mother tongue and I struggled enormously at first with all these terms and the peculiar accents . I shall definitely jump to buy the subtitled edition too when it comes out ! Not to mention I am truly looking forward to the sequel !!! Flatterland - my last summer reading I mean . How does this sound Sir Ladd ? " ,10
" Wonderful Adaptation , Unlike Anything You 've Ever Seen . This is what independent work is all about . The animation is beautiful , yet not like any animation you 've seen . This is no slick rip-off of successful style with smarmy pop-culture references ; no Disney\/Pixar wannabes here . The director has a vision of his own and makes it happen . It 's a very , very good adaptation of the Abbott novel , witty , with good voice-work and very good music . There are some mind-blowing sequences towards the end , but the most impressive quality is the originality of the vision . If this is the director 's first feature , there are big things in store for him . Do n't lose that vision ! A film like this gives me hope . " ,9
" Awesome film , fun for the whole family ! . I have to say , I love this film . I bought is as soon as the special release was available and my DVD is numbered # 11 ! The detailed animation in this film is very impressive . The intricate inner workings of the Flatlanders blew me away . I mean with a bunch of characters on the screen you could see all of their eyes blink , hearts beat , etc. . I was simply amazed at the level of detail . I never read the book but the story is really great . It really makes you wonder what 's beyond our 3D world . My kids loved this film also . They keep asking if they can watch it again . It 's really cool to see the different things the kids pick up on , and how they interpret the film . The film is deep on many levels . The music was spot on and fit each scene just right . I would highly recommend this film to anyone ! I 'd love to see this in the theater . FLATLAND THE FILM RULES !!! " ,10
" Two reviews in one . This review covers both versions of `` Flatland '' released in 2007 , one by Ladd Ehlinger , Jr. with a mostly unknown voice cast , and the other by Jeffrey Travis with some Hollywood big names providing the voices . The source material for both is the 1884 novella by Edwin A. Abbott , but the approaches of the two films differ radically . The book is a staple of science fiction , and one of the few to address mathematical issues at its core . Being a product of its time , the book is technically naive , and politically incorrect based on current sensibilities . The Travis film is visually slicker , but significantly shorter , and tackles philosophical issues relative to the passage of time from initial publication . As such , it tampers with the plot to mixed effect . Unlike some others , I have no problem with some of the revisions to the underlying plot since they do help bring some of the book 's major issues into somewhat sharper focus . On the other hand , they also add a `` feel good '' and politically correct sensibility that seems out of place . The Ehlinger film is much truer to its source material , which is both a strength and a weakness . Given a current perspective , its 19th century depiction of the political and social subjugation of women is a distraction that the Travis film avoids . It 's also a longer film and could have been more effective with some of the same plot and editing license employed in the Travis film . Where it does tamper with the plot , some of the decisions are questionable as other reviewers have pointed out . So which is better ? In my opinion , the short answer is the Ehlinger film . Despite its length , political incorrectness , and technical inferiority -LRB- the animation of the Travis film is much more sophisticated -RRB- , it resonates at a technical level to a degree that the Travis film ca n't match . As a scientist , this means a lot to me . On the other hand , the Travis film resonates on an emotional level that the Ehlinger film ca n't match . So the answer may be whether you 're looking for technical insight or emotional satisfaction . Most jarring in the Travis film is that , unlike the Ehlinger film , the animators never quite caught on to the implications of a two-dimensional universe . It is filled with objects which are instantly recognizable to us , yet would be clearly impossible or meaningless in the film 's reality -LRB- e.g. the protagonist 's daughter has toys which only make sense to someone with a 3-D perspective , and how does he open his briefcase ? -RRB- . The cover art is an obvious first impression example . The Travis film 's characters look more human , but ask yourself how their eyes work . One detail of the book is that looking at a Flatlander from above , all of his internal organs are clearly visible , as they should be . Travis ' animators hint at this , but do n't meet it head-on . The Ehlinger film 's animators may not have had the resources to make as slick a film as Travis ' , but they obviously gave a great deal of thought to what they were doing -LRB- or maybe not , since the necessary designs were all in the book -RRB- . In short , Travis had the budget , but Ehlinger had the passion for the project - albeit perhaps a bit too much respect for the source to create a truly superior adaptation . The differences reflect different target audiences , though . The Travis film is an educational short film which was obviously meant to be viewed by classrooms of middle school and high school students . As such , it had to be socially inoffensive while conveying concepts of geometry that would never occur to non-mathematicians . That it includes recognizable names voicing the characters will help it grab a bit more attention - an educational short film for the `` X-Files '' generation . The Ehlinger film would mostly appeal to people with a college level interest in mathematics , or others who are already familiar with the book . Neither film is perfect , but I 'm giving the Ehlinger film a rating of 8 and the Travis film a rating of 6 . Depending on your sensibilities , your conclusion may be exactly opposite of mine , so I hope this review includes enough information to guide you to an informed selection . Or , like me , you could simply buy both ... ;--RRB- " ,8
" Surprisingly poiniant . This is a great film with a lot of strong philosophy weaved in , I 'm not surprised to find that there is a great book behind this film . The central plot for the film is a 2D world and two factions within it . Right from the start of the film you are bombarded with parallels to reality and its hard not to get distracted by your own thought chain , in a good way :-RRB- The CGI is as good as it needs to be to tell this story , the yellow sphere that you 'll have seen if you 've read this far is a bit misleading - the film has its own unique style that extends further than such basic geometry and reflections . The actors voice overs are quite good , the film is n't amateur and there is a lot of narration to help the story along . My main criticism of the film would be an excess of narration - sometimes its useful but other times its downright patronising and by the end you end up sighing every time you see narration . " ,7
" A welcome departure from the special effect extravaganza that Sci-Fi is usually associated with . It basically is a teaching play about this two-dimensional world . How it functions physically , which teaches about physics . How its society works , which is a satirical parable of our own society , of course . And then there is a little science fiction , mathematics , philosophy and somewhat TRON-ish fantasy . About half-way into the film a 3D character appears in Flatland . He tries to explain the movie 's star , A Square -LRB- That 's his name . He 's the brother of B Square -RRB- , that there is a dimension beyond him . But since it is hard to explain the 3rd dimension to A Square the 2D character and the audience are transported into the 3rd dimension inhabited by spheres , cubes etc. . It happens what has to happen : A Square concludes that when there is a dimension beyond his there must also be a dimension beyond the 3rd one . A theory which the 3D character can only laugh at ... The approach is rather comedic , but the film is hardly kids stuff . A noteworthy stylistic decision is the unusual narrative . Instead of a voice-over it constantly switches to intertitles just like in a silent picture . At least during the first half when the audience needs to get a grasp on the basics of the two-dimensional universe . It gives the film an odd pacing but it worked quite well for me , simply because it 's a fresh approach . The animation is crude , which becomes especially evident when the film switches into the 3rd dimension -LRB- Spaceland -RRB- . But as simply animated as it might be it was done with a lot of attention to detail and most importantly the world that was created is a consistent and functional one . It gives a very good understanding of the several dimensions and how it might be if a living entity could exist within only two dimensions . It 's comprehensible , but not oversimplified . One purpose of the film , of course , is to make you think about the fourth dimension - what it could be like , the possibilities , and even how certain unexplained phenomena in the world might be explainable with the existence of another dimension . It is a Sci-Fi film that is all about ideas . A welcome departure from the special effects extravaganza that Sci-Fi is usually associated with . More theoretical than most Sci-Fi films , but not as purely theoretical as it might sound from my descriptions . There is plenty of fun to be had as well . The film is based on a genre-grossing novel written in the 19th century , which you may or may not know . It 's said to be popular amongst mathematics , physicists and computer science students . Another adaption of this novel has been made in the same year , a 34-minute short called ` Flatland : The Movie ' which appears to be targeted towards a younger audience . If you find the basic premise even only mildly intriguing then this is a highly recommended watch . " ,8
" Flatland the Film it 's great and I love the hidden things within it keep up the great work . . As a person that is interested in Math and when I heard about Flatland the Film I had to obtain a copy . The first time I watched Flatland the film I found it very interesting with great 3D animation . As I watched a second and third time I began to notice hidden things within the film , which must have been placed within the film on purpose , and I did not notice them the first time I watched . In addition , every time I watch it the question comes to mind how many things did you guys hide in this film and is it your trademark ??? I found the film was very true to the book and have recommended this Film to many and the response has been great . We have planned some viewing parties to see if we can find more hidden things . This film is great keep up the good work . When is your next film coming out and what is will be hidden in it ? " ,10
" You people certainly like your shiny things . . There 's not much I can say about this work of art , but I admire the depth and complexity of the film . There 's so much information and logic throughout , I almost felt as though I had gained knowledge by watching it . I 'll put it simply . It 's about a character , known simply as A Square , who lives in a 2 Dimensional world known only as Flatland . Why ? Well , because it 's flat of course . All the people are squares , circles , hexagons , etc. . . but all of them are equally as flat as the other . They have no idea of 3 Dimensional space . That is , until A Sphere appears from Spaceland and takes A Square on a whirlwind journey of discovery and intrigue where he learns all about the 3rd dimension and his own purpose in life . It 's all rather confusing and irregular in it 's general presentation , but it 's also one of the best animated films I 've seen in a long time . I 'm left with a distinct feeling of wonder and deep thought that I 've not experienced in years . It feels amazing . So overall , it 's an excellent film that I highly recommend . " ,10
" great animation - very thoughtful . I had not read the book that this was based on . There was even a sense that this would be a waste of time . I realized I was very wrong . As others have mentioned in their comments : this is no Hollywood canon fodder intended for the spoon-fed masses . Some interest in mathematics or science is not essential but more than likely contributes to ones viewing of the film . I found the story very thoughtful and entertaining at the same time . The film is well executed and easy to watch . -LRB- Two dimensional characters do not have facial Tiks - just my thoughts -RRB- " ,10
" Excellent film , stays mostly true to the book . . This movie is a great portrayal of the Abbott book . The graphics are very well done and shows what can be done today with some determination and a home computer . I think someone who did n't understand the concepts of the universe and how our perception of dimensions controls what we believe will have their eyes opened to the possibilities raised if dimensions we do n't know about exist . The weaknesses I see in this film were in the one-dimensional voices . There was little emotion and passion . It sounded like something I would hear in an elementary school production . Some of the transitions between scenes seemed awkward and occasionally it was unclear exactly what was supposed to be happening , though I find many films based on books have this problem . All in all the movie is a success . I highly recommend it as an entertaining and educational experience and a nice change from the standard Hollywood fare . " ,8
" A travesty of film making . Flatland is one of my favorite books , thus I was looking forward to this film . Unfortunately , the film is absolutely horrible . The dialog is so bad it sounds like improv half the time . The new storyline makes me think they took the book and a couple of newspapers , threw them in a blender and used what came out for the screenplay . It 's a disgrace to the book and independent film making . The only reason I even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it 'd get better . Unfortunately , it only got worse , climaxing in a really retarded ending . That 's not to say EVERYTHING about the movie is bad . The CG is acceptable , in a 1990 's `` Reboot '' sort of way which I assume is what they were going for . And I suppose you ca n't go wrong with `` people '' getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place . " ,2
" A very well-acted study of three fragile souls . . Three soldiers are home from Iraq ; a 40-ish Tim Robbins out for good and the young Michael Pena and Rachel McAdams on a thirty day leave . Each has their own problem that they are faced with at the beginning of the film . Robbins comes home to a wife who wants a divorce and a son who needs $ 20,000 for college , Pena suffered a wound that has made him impotent and McAdams lost her friend and wants to find his family in order to return his guitar and live with them since she 's lost any ties with her own . Think every problem is going to be solved in a little bow by the end ? Well , you 'd be right . Think that it 's going to really typical and schmaltzy ? Not so much on that one . It seems like a film that 's made for the obvious ups and downs throughout but it actually manages to be quite original and refreshing . Instead of feeling like a film that 's just about resolving the individual situations , it 's a lot more carefree and a lot more about these three people simply enjoying life together and keeping one another joyful . Of course there are many different stops on the way to their ultimate destinations in order to give us some situations of them interacting in the real world , but each one is a lot of fun and we gain a little more depth to the characters at each stop . All of the characters are well-fleshed out and do n't feel like just another retread of stereotypes we 've seen over and over again . One of the things that really surprised me is that when a little romance starts to bloom between Pena and McAdams , I did n't roll my eyes like I would have expected but instead I smiled and enjoyed watching this flirtation grow between the two of them in a non-typical way . And all the way through we are treated to three strong performances from three solid actors . The real star is Rachel McAdams , who I 'd say is Oscar-worthy . She keeps the laughs coming all the way through and steals every single scene with her bright eyes and southern drawl , but you can tell that there is real emotion brimming just under the surface . She 's a girl who has every reason to hate life with a fury , but she remains optimistic and tries to get those around her to enjoy living just as much as she does . One scene in particular , when she finally meets the family of her fallen friend , is a showcase for what an extraordinary actress she is . This is her best performance by a long shot , and definitely one of the best of the year . The Lucky Ones is something that could have been obvious and clich d , but ended up being just the opposite ; a refreshing and very well-acted story that I wish was n't destined to be forgotten come awards season .

" A Gentleness That Rings True . Three soldiers who have received non life threatening wounds in Iraq are together on a plane to New York . Two of them are on thirty day leaves while the other has served his time and is on his way home . Due to a power outage , all flights out of New York have been canceled . The three agree to rent a car together in order to continue the trip to their destinations . Thus begins a road trip that is highly dramatic with its share of comic events . Fred Cheaver is the middle aged father figure of the three - a man who never really expected to do anything in the army except serve his domestic reserve duty . He is glad to be rid of the whole thing and is headed home to his wife and son . The two young soldiers who accompany Fred are Colee Dunn and T.K. Poole . Colee is a bright-eyed innocent who is on a mission for a fallen comrade who saved her life . T.K. is a no nonsense soldier from a family of soldiers who plans to make the army his career and move up the chain of command . Whereas , Fred 's quest is to return home to wife and son , Colee 's and T.K. 's goals are to travel to Las Vegas for two entirely different reasons . Colee wants to return her dead comrade 's treasured guitar to his family . T.K. 's reason is somewhat mysterious , but we know it is related in some way to his injury that has left him temporarily impotent . As with all road trip films , the experiences and interactions of these three lead to conclusions not expected by them or the viewers . Unlike most films featuring vets returning from the horrors of war , this film is not filled with dark angst - not to say the characters are not well-fleshed and genuine . These three are real people with real problems , but their depictions are not heavy-handed . During this film , the viewer gets to enjoy the work of three excellent actors . Tim Robbins gives his usual fine , understated performance as the older man facing some totally unexpected twists of fate . Rachel McAdams gives Colee a likable innocence but also reveals some darker layers of her character . Michael Pe a is very , very good as the macho guy with a heart who only wants to be a good soldier . Watching these three interact is a real treat . Some may consider the treatment of the subject matter of this film too light handed , but it has a gentleness that rings true . It is surely worth watching . " ,7
" Our soldiers deserve more than a Thank You when they return home . -LRB- Synopsis -RRB- After recovering from their wounds in the Iraq War , three soldiers are sent back to the United States . Sgt. T.K. Poole -LRB- Michael Pena -RRB- and Pvt. Colee Dunn -LRB- Rachel McAdams -RRB- are given a 30-day leave , and Sgt. Fred Cheever -LRB- Tim Robbins -RRB- is retiring . The three soldiers now have a new mission . T.K is going home to visit his fianc e , Colee is going to return a guitar to the family of the man who saved her life , and Fred is going home to his wife in St. Louis . When they arrive at JFK Airport in New York , all fights have been canceled , because of a blackout . The three decide to rent a van and drive to St. Louis , and once there , T.K. and Colee can catch a plane to Las Vegas . What started out to be a short 14 hour trip ends up being a journey across America . Along the way , the three soldiers who had just met at JFK , become close friends . -LRB- My Comment -RRB- This is a human interest story that explores the interpersonal aspects that war has on our soldiers , especially the ones who are injured as they return home . We learn the pitfalls of returning to this country where our soldiers are only given a token `` Thank You '' platitude from the public . We also see how three soldiers band together , and become in a sense a family taking care of one another . The film gives enough time in the character development of each soldier that we begin to like each soldier , and you would n't mind making them your friends . Their cross-county road trip is full of foolish misadventures that are memorable . For the most part , the film is serious to a point , yet it is also a comedy . I believe this small film will be one of those sleeper movies that the public will like , and it could be a hit . -LRB- QED International , Run Time 1:55 , Rated R -RRB- -LRB- 8\/10 -RRB- " ,8
" an awesome quirky little film . . Neil Burger 's offbeat , quirky , dramatic movie is a triumph . It succeeds in all the aspects , from the technical parts to the acting , I ca n't find a single negative thing about it . Burger does n't dilly-dally around , he went straight to the point of his subject , giving a fair amount of time for each of the three characters -LRB- McAdams , Pena and Robbins -RRB- to develop and eventually you ca n't help but really like them ... a lot . Especially McAdams but more on that later . The script is tightly wound , the chemistry between the three protagonists does n't seem forced , the movie does n't force you to like them the moment the movie starts but instead , these colorful characters will gradually grow on you . Tim Robbins , one of my favorite actors , does n't disappoint . 2008 , I have seen him in two movies the other one being The City of Ember . And as long as a movie has Tim Robbins in it , I 'm sold . That 's why I watched the movie in the first place . Michael Pena , another great guy , gives off a good vibe towards the movie and once you know what 's been bothering his character , you ca n't help but laugh at how one-sided and ridiculous his problem is . Pena gives one of his greatest performance on screen . And of course , the belle of the ball , the star of the show , Rachel McAdams gives a quirky , zesty and joyful performance as a lovable Southerner and I ca n't help but be reminded of another quirky , zesty and joyful character , Amelie . She just keeps the laughs rolling in and steal every scene she 's in . She gives the character such depth that one might come off as one dimensional had it been portrayed by a lesser talent . Definitely an underrated performance for 2008 . Highly recommended . " ,10
" Underrated gem . I 'd never heard of Neil Burger 's `` The Lucky Ones '' until a friend recommended it to me after catching it on a flight to Australia . Released in theaters stateside last year , it was pulled after making a paltry $ 267,000 in its opening week . This is a hell of a shame as what we have here is the first great movie about the Iraq war . Three soldiers return to the states on leave and through circumstances end up on a road trip to Vegas . Michael Pena is a cocky Sargeant with a wound in his manhood , struggling to come to terms with how his Fianc will react to his impotence . Tim Robbins is a veteran trying to find the money to send his kid to college and thus stop him enlisting . But the standout performance , and quite possibly the standout performance of the past year full stop , comes from Rachel McAdams as a naive private returning her dead boyfriends guitar to his family . Her turn here is far superior to anything Oscar nominated this year and probably the best from an American actress since Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby . The films strongest point is its lack of a `` message '' . Pro war or Anti war , you 'll find your own point of view here and Burger is subtle enough to allow you the privilege . I wo n't give it away but this has a great ambiguous seventies style ending , just the way I like 'em . It 's always a good sign when a movie ends and you wish you could get to see more of the characters , and it 's an all too rare occurrence in modern cinema . For this Burger and his cast should be applauded . " ,8
" A very well done comedy\/drama that is relevant to America today . . This is one of the funniest movies about serious topics , and I thought the acting was excellent . Almost every scene in the film has the three main actors in it , and the dynamic between them is fun to watch . The three soldiers coming home on leave find themselves stuck together , and a road trip adventure ensues . The circumstances they get into tell us a lot about the characters , and each scene gives more depth to the individuals and the relationships that develop . I really liked all three main characters even with their flaws . I laughed more during this movie than I usually do during comedies so I guess that means it has my kind of humor . Unlike the review by Super and Mik , I did n't think it was slow or the ending at all predictable . I thought the plot was engaging . I rated the movie 9 out of 10 stars , but I 'm not sure what could have made it a ten . It 's well written with a balance between comedy and drama . It 's perfectly cast , and I also liked the directing and attention to detail . I highly recommend this flick . I do n't understand why it flopped at the box office . " ,9
" Terrific American road movie . Three soldiers back from Iraq team up and rent a car to drive to their respective destinations . Things happen to them along the way . When they get to their destinations , what they find is not what they expected . That 's The Lucky Ones in a nutshell . But it does n't do justice to this quirky , touching and funny film . Tim Robbins and Michael Pena give sturdy , soldierly performances , but the real story here is Rachel McAdams , who is mesmerizing as the blunt talking , somewhat naive , wounded -LRB- literally , in her thigh -RRB- , deeply religious , sexually open minded and perpetually optimistic Pvt. Colee Dunn . She is a ray of pure southern sunshine and steals every scene she is in . Some highlights : A furious McAdams throws her soda on Pena when he insults her boyfriend , killed in Iraq , by saying he was unfit to be a soldier because he supposedly did armed robbery . McAdams lashes out in a bar when some valley girl-types mock her limp . Good thing I did n't have my weapon , she says after . All three end up at an evangelical service and McAdams stands up to testify , blithely telling embarrassing secrets about her companions while they cringe . After locking their keys in the car , they trudge off for help and end up at a Hummer dealership . On the way back in a luxury Hummer , they compare this one with what they 're more used to . When McAdams arrives at her dead boyfriend 's family , she finds out his colorful depiction of them was somewhat embellished . What she decides to tell them about him is even more embellished to spare their feelings . In fact , this scene is so moving it is probably the highlight of McAdams acting career . Robbins is at a rich man 's party and meets a beautiful woman who begins flirting with him . He asks if she 's married and she says , Umm . They both start laughing hysterically . This movie has many such moments . One lowlight : A contrived , cheap-looking tornado scene that 's just in the movie to give Pena and McAdams a chance to huddle in a drainpipe , allowing a certain delightful discovery to be made . Afterward , the twister has blown the landscape to pieces , but their vehicle is untouched . Final thought : This is not an Iraq movie . This is an America movie . " ,8
" A nice light-hearted drama . The Lucky ones concerns three Iraq War soldiers who have just returned to the States : Fred Cheever -LRB- Tim Robbins -RRB- is out for good , and ca n't wait to reunite with his wife and son in St. Louis ; T.K. Poole -LRB- Michael Pena -RRB- has suffered an embarrassing injury and is on his way to reconnecting with his fianc e before heading back overseas ; and the also-injured Colee Dunn -LRB- Rachel McAdams -RRB- is on a mission to deliver a precious guitar to her deceased boyfriend 's parents in Las Vegas . These strangers are brought together when JFK Airport is shut down indefinitely . Deciding that renting a car is a better option than twiddling their thumbs and waiting for the planes to fly , they hit the road on an eventful journey that will bring them closer together than they ever would have expected ... The Lucky Ones is a film that does n't really make any statements about the war . Instead it 's a character study of these 3 soldiers and it shows how the return from war can be weird and bizarre . The film handles some very dramatic subjects but , always in a light way . As in every road trip film , the character 's journey is full of chance encounters and misadventures , and each one of the soldiers ends up fighting some of their own demons or coming to certain realizations . Granted , some of the events feel a bit contrived , but this is a dramedy , not a realistic war drama . The film was very well acted starting with Michael Pena , who despite doing mostly small roles , was a pleasant surprise as a central character . The veteran Tim Robbins delivered a good , even if subtle , performance as the older soldier who 's life becomes upside down . However the film belongs to the gorgeous Rachel McAdams ; she was feisty , charismatic and overall , just great , as she usually is . One can not help but to fall a little bit in love with her every time she does a film . At the end of the day , The Lucky Ones is a quirky little film with a certain gentleness that works mainly , because it focuses on the characters and their emotions and not on the war and it 's motives . Definitely a nice watch . 7\/10 " ,7
" Lost in the Shuffles . I had tickets for this at the Toronto International Film Festival last summer but was side-tracked by an obscure little film called Slumdog Millionaire instead , so only got around to watching it last night on pay-per-view . In a strange way , the two films have a good deal in common . In an era in which everyone seems to want either tense thrillers , puerile comedies or awesome special effects -LRB- the only one here , as has been pointed out , is a cheaply put together tornado -RRB- , both movies offer little more than a thoroughly improbable plot and a focus on character development . But both work remarkably well . I am puzzled by those who found that the movie dragged . While most of the plot development was telegraphed not once but several times , the acting from all three leads was both believable and very deft . At first I thought that Rachel McAdams ' character was simply too naive to be true but it soon became apparent that she was much wiser than we -LRB- or even she -RRB- knew . She plays it beautifully . Tim Robbins is wonderful too , and rather pathetic , in a down-to-earth role as an aging war veteran , happy to have survived and soon to be confronted with some harsh realities . But Michael Pena was the real surprise . He is completely captivating in his portrayal of a proud young vet from a military family on his way to meet his girlfriend , with his masculinity compromised by a war injury . His character is the most subtly poignant as he confronts his own fears about his manhood , on several levels . Like all movies based on the Iraqi war , this seems to suffer from America 's desire to ignore the war altogether , just as they ignored the Vietnam veterans a generation ago -LRB- Coming Home , The Deer Hunter -RRB- . America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then , or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War II . " ,7
" Grows on You as it Progresses . I was n't sure if I liked The Lucky Ones from the opening moments - it seemed a little implausible and contrived , but over the runtime the movie settled into some interesting character development and story . I liked the directors willingness to keep it low-key and quirky . -LRB- spoiler -RRB- One of the better scenes in the movie was the party , where we finally listen to some serious conversation and reflection on the current wars . The dialog is well written here , as you start to see the unwarranted and sneering ridicule that comes out misdirected at US Servicemen . The detractor\/anti-war character in the conversation demonstrates the idiocy of protesting a war to people in the service . The actors all do good jobs , and by the end the eventuality does n't seem surprising but highly fitting . Good movie . " ,8

" Excellent . This is excellent . This movie is a great example of how those in the military take care on one another . After my five years of military service as a Marine , I have found no other organization that works so well . This was a great example of how we -LRB- those in the military -RRB- get it done each and every day . It also illustrates that in the military we learn to work with both men and women and all colors . It is a simple matter of what is required to get the job done . Thanks for a good example of life in and out of the military . The characters were true to form and based on my experience showed the way it really is as one tries to adapt and adjust to live after returning from a deployment . It was so smart to include a woman and to write the lines in such a way to show that she was an equal . While only a newbie to the military , she demonstrated life experiences and knowledge that helped the more senior members of the cast . A great job of balancing and showing that life experiences help those in the military deal with situations . I do not think I can say enough how much I enjoyed watching this movie and experiences the life of military members through the characters in this film . Again , great job ! " ,10
" you 're lucky get to watch a good movie . Do you feel lucky ? The lucky ones sure do . Who are the lucky ones ? Rachel Adams , Tim Robbins , and Michael Pena star lighthearted road movie about three injury soldiers on the way back from duty , trying to head home across America . They are forced to drive together in a car , due to sudden black out forces all flights out of New York to be canceled . Each one has a purpose to get home , but on the way , the journey turns into self-discovery as all of them , learn a little bit more of themselves and each other through laughter and hardship . Tim Robbins is Cheaver -- a middle age soldier with a broken back who come back to a broken home - full of a wife who wants a divorce and a son who needs $ 20,000 for college . Rachel Adams is Colee who lost her friend and wants to find his family in order to return his guitar and live with them since she 's lost any ties with her own . Last is Michael Pena whom is TK who suffered a wound that has made him impotent trying to go to Las Vegas for treatment . Each character has it faults and charms . It 's really funny and intelligent but there are scenes that make you questions what message are they trying to show . There are hints of anti-war messages , while addressing the pros and cons of army life but all three understand their life in duties in the armed forces . - Three strong performances from three solid actors . A great watch in and out . Check it out " ,7
" Well acted , well told , solid film . . I sat down to this film not knowing anything beyond what the trailer depicted ... and I had only a vague memory of that . Is it a drama , a comedy , a what ... ? I can honestly say that I think the answer is yes . To all . It 's the most honest , solid , watchable film I 've seen in a long time . Nothing seemed forced , gratuitous , or pandering ... it 's just a well told , and acted , human story . Neither a magical , nor let-down ending ... unless one would count `` I wish more films could be made this well '' as a let down . So , that 's my opinion , which does n't mean much ... unless you are like me , and enjoy the quality of a film more than the franchise future possibilities of one . " ,10
" The Unlucky Ones . Well this movie could have been so much more . The trailers featured the emotional `` I will remember you '' but the movie , apparently adjusted to growing indifference to the Iraq War by many , was afraid to let you care too much . I was really disappointed to see what happened with this film . I did a little bit of extra work -LRB- was cut from the guitar scene at last minute -RRB- on this film and it never even showed in Edwardsville , Illinois -LRB- near ST. Louis -RRB- where `` Denver '' scenes were filmed . I could n't disagree more about Rachel MacAdams character . As an actress her job is reflect reality and some of the people who turn to the military in rural small town America where often times jobs were hard to come by before the economic meltdown . Someone from Colee 's background probably would n't talk like someone Harvard bound , coming from a broken home etc. . She brilliantly portrayed someone who refused to be held down by the life she was born into , was highly inquisitive , caring , supportive . She was a beautiful person , a great character that Rachel brought life to . She was n't intelligent , but she was n't dumb if you can wrap your mind about that . I thought she turned in a tremendous performance that too few people saw . I also bet there were tremendous moments left on the cutting room floor . I really thought many aspects of her performance were Oscar quality . Oh gee and Tim Robbins is n't the first actor to have political views . He 's a professional and I did n't see an overwhelming agenda in his role . He seemed to focus on telling a story about what happens to these people when they return home . Michael Pena continues to be an underrated talent . I give the George Lucas stale raspberry award for bad CGI moments to the crew for including a stupid tornado scene that looked like it came from the Buster Keaton era . They did a much better job in '39 with the Wizard of Oz ! I wonder if this film will be `` put back together '' with the DVD . " ,7
" I 'll give it a ` lucky ' seven out of ten . After being a huge fan of Neil Burger 's first big movie , The Illusionist , I was very intrigued in seeing his next film . With an interesting cast of Michael Pena , Rachel McAdams , and Tim Robbins , I was very interest in seeing how the chemistry of these three would be together . They were very good . We have the older vet , Fred Cheaver -LRB- Tim Robbins -RRB- , who just wants to go home and enjoy his remaining years with his wife and son . T.K. Pool -LRB- Michael Pena -RRB- got wounded in his private area and is afraid he ca n't ` get it up ' with his girl where the relationship is apparently based on sex . And then we have Colee Dunn . She 's the outgoing outsider with a broken family but means well with attempting to bring a guitar to a family she does n't know where her friend and their son was killed in combat . She expects to live with them . The chemistry between the main leads are very good -LRB- especially Rachel McAdams -RRB- . They do n't have a ego problem as you might see in most post war movies -LRB- see Stop-Loss -RRB- . I believe Burger 's biggest point was to demonstrate the bond the the army has on each other and how they would go to big lengths to make sure one another is OK and safe while of course testing one another with impossible questions . T.K. did n't like Colee 's deceased friend Randy even though he never knew him . Randy robbed a casino according to Colee and T.K. felt that 's what the military does n't want . Soldiers escaping their problems . Fred would always be there to babysit the two if any issues between the two would get out of hand but the truth is , the three of them loved each other . This film has no comparison to the very special The Illusionist but that is a very good thing . Variety seems to be an issue for a good portion of new coming directors in this new century . Neil Burger relied on a tight script and painted characters with ridiculous recurrences and run ins that made you one again understand why it was called ` The Lucky Ones . ' My favorite was when Fred went to see his wife , she nonchalantly asked for a divorce . Moments later his son came home and said he needed tens of thousands of dollars to get into Stanford . After Fred went back out with his friends to relieve some tension , he ran into an old friend that he worked with who explained that the company that Fred and him worked for was out of business obviously meaning that Fred had no job and really no way of giving money to his son at the time . Solid film and lots of problems bit it saved by very good chemistry and performances . " ,7
" Terrifying waste of talent . Three stars given strictly for three wonderfully talented actors - McAdams , Pena , Robbins - who , regrettably , had zero opportunity to display such talent in this turkey . Not to malign turkeys . As for the rest of the cast ? They all acted like they had something better to do ... which , in the case of this flick , they probably did . Regardless , for the simple fact of being paid , one should give more than a listless performance . Hey , maybe another three stars for phoning it in . Writing : inane drivel . Directing : lacklustre at best . Most annoying : the constant You OK ? You OK ? filler dialogue . Film could have been good . Was n't . IMO . " ,3
" Excellent film , but also frustratingly god-awful . Written and directed by Neil Burger , The Lucky Ones tells the story of three United States Army soldiers who return from the 2003 US invasion of Iraq to embark on an unplanned road trip across the United States . The film is a fairly faithful update of William Wyler 's The Best Years of Our Lives and Hal Ashby 's The Last Detail , though Burger claims never to have seen the former film . Like Wyler 's film , which was also ironically titled , The Lucky Ones centres on three servicemen of different social strata , rank and age . There 's Sgt Cheaver -LRB- Tim Robbins -RRB- , who 's wrestling with a divorce and financial problems , Pvt Colee Dunn -LRB- Rachel McAdams -RRB- , who 's struggling to cope with a wounded leg , poverty and isolation , and Sgt Poole -LRB- Michael Pena -RRB- , whose sex organs have been severely damaged by a piece of shrapnel . There 's a lot of good stuff in the film . Burger 's direction is gentle , easygoing and relaxed , our trio of characters are both likable and pleasantly low-key , the gang 's road trip is immensely fun and the film features a number of fine conversations . Unfortunately The Lucky Ones also contains a number of absolutely god-awful scenes which totally kill the picture . Such heavy handed atrocities scenes which would embarrass most writers - include a sudden marital break-up , an out-of-nowhere argument over a locked car , a ridiculous car crash and a LITERAL TORNADO ATTACK . Half this movie is a masterpiece of low key observation , the other half is an embarrassment . What 's going on ? Still , mentally filter out these terrible moments and the film has a lot to recommend . Burger positions us to sympathise with these soldiers , shows how the army exploits minorities and the marginalised , how each of these characters has absolutely no place to go , no one to take them in but the Armed Forces , how the military engenders dependency , how enlistees treat income and institutional connection as a bigger priority than the larger ethical and political ramifications of War , how the Army neuters ideological conflict -LRB- within its staff -RRB- , how civilians -LRB- on either end of the political spectrum -RRB- condescendingly treat soldiers , how the military experience is completely divorced from the every-day reality of most Americans , how soldiers oft return home to a kind of soft segregation , how the soldiering class is almost a class unto itself , often unable to mingle comfortably with others , how the army compensates for weak egos and becomes an almost cultic figure for the disenfranchised etc etc. . This is an unusually perceptive film . But a frustrating one too , because for every good sequence there 's an abomination which makes you want to gouge your eyes out . 7.9 \/ 10 Frustrating . " ,7
" very entertaining indeed . . . I saw this film recently and its very entertaining indeed !!! , may be a little subtle at times the film makes up an excellent story with an equally good performances.Its a story about three people from the army , complete strangers at first who ultimately start to find about each other on a road trip that lies ahead.The film is a mixture of comedy and drama in an almost perfect way.I do n't have much more to say about it but i do recommend this one to the viewers , so if you wan na pass another 100 minutes or so id say go ahead and i am sure you wo n't regret your decision , road trip movies are usually interesting and this is no exception . .

" I like this movie ! The three soldiers take a road trip . . The three main characters are totally different from each other . At a picnic they probably would have little to say to each other . But all three just arrived by plane in NY , from war , on 30-day Army leave , and are about to catch planes to their eventual destinations . But something happens , a regional power outage has caused flight delays and cancellations . So they end up unlikely companions on a road trip . They are The Lucky Ones , they are still alive . Tim Robbins is Sgt Fred Cheaver , actually getting out of the military and on his way home to St Louis . He rents the last available car and takes along the two other soldiers to share expenses and driving . They will catch planes from St Louis . Rachel McAdams is Colee Dunn , country girl , unsophisticated and unfiltered , she says whatever crosses her mind . She has been wounded in the leg and has a limp . Michael Pe a is T.K. Poole . He was also wounded , but in an embarrassing place , his male private parts . Some of the funnier scenes occur when Colee tries to get him help for his -LRB- hopefully temporary -RRB- ED . The three actors are very good here and their interactions are interesting . I found myself wanting to own the DVD so that I can re-watch it periodically . UPDATE : I just watched it again after almost 2 months and enjoyed it as much the second time . SPOILERS : Cheaver arrives home to a standoff-ish wife , she has decided she will be happier single . At the same time their son announces he has been accepted at Stanford but needs $ 20,000 within 3 weeks to hold his place . Colee 's boyfriend was killed and she is surprising the boy 's parents by delivering his guitar to them in Las Vegas . The deceased soldier turns out to be a big fraud , with girlfriend and baby back home , and Colee gets to keep the guitar . Cheaver tries to win $ 20,000 in LV but fails , but re-inlists for the $ 20,000 bonus . They all end up back together , about to be shipped off to 3 separate fighting zones , not knowing if they ever will see each other again . " ,8
" Soldiers back from Iraq ... welcome to the real world ! . Three soldiers returning from Iraq after sustaining injuries received during combat expecting a normal 30 days of leave . When their flights get canceled is when their journey starts . Expectations of home are not what they thought it would be . Being in the Army you have heard of and experienced this and know it can be true . The movie does a great job of portraying the Army in and out of Iraq . Three very different actors that do a great job of showing the diversity in the Army and going from state to state show their different backgrounds . Too much driving and not enough action . Movie was boring at parts and the ending was pretty predicable . We would recommend to watch this after dinner with the family . Good movie but could have been a little more lively . Super and Mik out ! " ,7
" Intelligent comic drama about war and real people . Kind of a road picture for soldiers home from the Iraqi front , I do n't think writer\/director Neil Burger intends to make an antiwar statement ... but pretty much any human being with a heart will take it as such . The quote above , No , thank YOU , occurs at several points in the story as these three soldiers , on leave Fred Cheaver -LRB- Tim Robbins -RRB- , T.K. Poole -LRB- Michael Pe a -RRB- , and Colee Dunn -LRB- Rachel McAdams -RRB- make their way across the US . What happens is they have a transaction with a civilian who learns they 're from the front , and the soldier will say thank you to end the exchange , to which the civilian will say , No , thank YOU . With emphasis , expressing the fairly common sentiment that we have toward those in uniform . ...

" On the road again . It 's not about where you go ... it 's about the way\/road and how you are going to cross that , to get there . In other words , it 's about the journey . It 's about the fact , that while you are on your way , things -LRB- and maybe you -RRB- will change . It 's about your flaws , about your personality and how you that will mix up with other people . It 's about a story written in a great way and played by some great actors . Rachel McAdams has the looks , but she also has the talent . You might not agree with the political statements Tim Robbins makes , but you ca n't fault his acting abilities . I forgot the name of the third lead , but I have seen him in a quite a few movies and he does deliver here too . A story more about the people , than any political statement . And that might be something , that some people will miss out in this . Like what is the point ? . But that 's exactly it . How can you explain life ? How can you explain fully what you -LRB- or the characters in this case -RRB- are doing ? You just ca n't . So the director -LRB- and screenwriter -RRB- stay true to just tell the story . And this works very fine . " ,9
" A long road to nowhere . After watching the trailer for this movie , my wife and I were interested in seeing it and jumped at the chance to go to a free , advance screening . During the movie , it kind of felt like the story was going somewhere and even though it was fairly slow , I was interested . Then the movie ended , and it felt like nothing had happened at all . Despite the decent acting and the initial promise of the story line , the ending to the movie just made it feel like we had wasted two hours of our life . My wife also hated the way Rachael McAdams character was written . She said that she thought her character was written to be the stereo-typical sad , unintelligent woman . I would n't recommend this movie to anyone , unless you need somewhere to go to take a nap for about 2 hours . " ,3
" I 've seen big-time expensive turkeys that were n't nearly as entertaining . . It 's not a bad job . The characters are convincing , even if some of the action is n't . If you can accept stylized , unconvincing violence -LRB- no blood anywhere -RRB- , which I do n't mind , the story has some new twists . The first two thirds seem a bit aimless , like Mean Streets down under , just a tale of four thugs who seem to have an appointment to keep in the afternoon , and manage to keep it , in spite of the befuddled police they have to deal with in New Zealand . It 's funny ; it could have been funnier , but for something I never heard of before a street vendor offered it to me , it ai n't bad . The acting is generally acceptable ; the camera-work is utilitarian . Technically , it succeeds in some ways , e.g. , the steadicam work , but fails in others , e.g. , under - and over-exposure , or their digital equivalents . The dialogue is in Kiwi , i.e. , `` english '' , but it would benefit from subtitles , also in English , as in The Harder They Come . It 's worth noting that the vaunted technical achievement -LRB- long , uncut shots -RRB- was barely noticeable-which means that it did what it was supposed to do without drawing attention to itself . " ,7
" You Move You Die , I was pleasantly surprised . As always it is the complainers that are the first to comment . I personally thoroughly enjoyed the film . Surely a films aim is to entertain ? Well this one did the job as far as I am concerned . Has something similar been done before ? probably but who cares , and without knowing how it was shot you -LRB- or at least I -RRB- could n't even attempt to judge how innovative it is . All I know is that it felt very different to watch than most movies you will see . As for the comment that this genre is dead ... what a load of tripe , this is not some Quentin T rip . It stands alone as an interesting story with some good twists and plenty of humor -LRB- assuming you like your humor fairly dry -RRB- Was it a low budget flick ? almost definitely , does it look `` cheap '' ? not at all . I think this is a breath of fresh air for the industry within NZ . And I firmly believe it is a good quality , entertaining flick . Is it the best movie in the world ? of course not ... still I liked it better than at least one huge blockbuster I saw recently . Mind you some people apparently ca n't live without huge explosions and\/or a festival of CGI ! If you enjoy the flavor of the `` british gangster '' type flick , and like your humor dark and dry you will probably enjoy this film . So go check it out you will probably enjoy it . Plus you are supporting genuine NZ film . . i.e. not financed from half a world away with the money and talent disappearing offshore the day it wraps . Oh and it might pay to watch to the end ... PS I ca n't wait to see what these guys can do with the next film and some cash support behind them ! " ,7
" Lock , stock and bottom of the barrel . Alas , Francis Ford Coppola was wrong . The digital camera revolution has not resulted in an explosion of talent gracing our screens . All it has delivered is the never ending glut of amateur material , posturing as cinema , that clog the shelves of video stores worldwide . YOU MOVE YOU DIE is a continuation of this never ending cycle of sub-mediocre , ego - driven and wholly wretched home-movies . Suffering through YOU MOVE YOU DIE is like watching a gang of young schoolboys , inspired by a movie they just saw , playing Goodies and Baddies as they chase each other around the drab back streets of their boring small town . They play-fight and play-act , and do all things their parents would frown upon -LRB- like swearing and smoking -RRB- . The jolly romp is all made up on the spur of the moment and after an hour or so , they 're so darn tuckered out from all the tussling and screaming and pointlessness of it all , so they simply ... stop . Now imagine a group of age-retarded adult men in their thirties , doing the above . Yet sadder still , is their friend with a video-camera who 's followed them around as they playact like little kids - bored during the summer holidays . Then afterwards , they all wearily -LRB- but satisfied and with much backslapping -RRB- go back home to endlessly watch themselves replayed on telly , over fizzy drinks and chips as they collectively fantasize about hanging out with Tarantino . That pretty much sums up wrist-slitting banality that is YOU MOVE YOU DIE . " ,1
" Unfair criticism . I found this movie entertaining . From the reviews I 've read thus far it seems I was one of the few who felt this way . Many of the reviewers on this site have been jaded by the big budget Hollywood epic . The funny thing is that these same reviewers are the first ones to lament about the dearth of fresh ideas found in modern cinema . I watch movies to be entertained , not to rush back to the IMDb forums to eviscerate the works of others . I do n't normally post my comments on IMDb , but felt this movie to unfairly criticized . " ,7
" Inspired film with originality . This is an obviously inspired film that is n't the usual predictable drivel that I see in so many films of this genre . It has a Taratinoesque quality to it but is n't quite so scattered brained as most of his movies are . The characters are interesting and personable and not over the top , and there are some genuinely funny moments . There is a little bit of bad acting but not from the main actors at all , just in some of the bit parts . The story line is very good and although there are some violent moments in the movie it was n't at all gory or messy . Also , the camera work is really quite unique and there is a flow to it that almost makes you feel like you are part of the movie . I would think that a lot of other filmmakers will be trying to use this type of effect in upcoming movies . Overall I would give this move at least an 8 out of 10 . " ,8
" Take if for what it 's worth - a lot of bang for the buck . For a movie I had never heard of , this movie was a very enjoyable surprise rental at the video store . There are hints of Pulp Fiction humor , a touch of low budget El Mariachi , nods to Lock , Stock or Snatch , and a real crappy Toyota station wagon . Considering the violence of the film , there is no real gore or blooded to be seen . Think of it as a crime caper comedy that does n't take itself seriously . Some film students\/critics may not love it , but ordinary people with open minds that enjoy a laugh with their crime caper will likely find it worth the time . It is reasonably polished for the reported $ 50K budget , throws in a twist or two , brings the laughs , and does n't try to overwhelm you with it 's `` art '' . I bought a DVD copy and recommend it often . I am looking forward to what they do with the sequel when they have a few more dollars to play with . " ,10
" Exactly what it says on the packet but even more . I bought this film for nothing in a Chinese market and sat down to watch it . The only thing on the cover in English was the title . For the first ten minutes I was trying to decide whether this film had been made by some kind of movie school in the UK or not , but to my growing joy I was proved wrong . Set in some town in New Zealand -LRB- Aukland maybe -RRB- , the film is basically about a day in the life of a bunch of ` hard men\/wise boys ' out to get back something stolen from their leader in a mugging . The story has obvious flaws - but tell me one that does n't . The dialogue is absolutely spot on . This is how we really speak . At least the gentlemen I know speak like this you 're a knob jockey being a fine example that comes to mind . Upon close of the film I found I had come across a great bunch of characters and all in their own way likable and recognisable from my own experiences . The lead duo I thought were superb , and you can tell while watching the film they were enjoying themselves . It 's all done with a great sense of fun and lust for life . If you are interested in watching a well made film , full action , great dialogue , magic characters , funny as hell - and without the biblical references , social pap , bare knuckle fighting and blood -LRB- although Mr Richie does this well -RRB- political correctness , etc. etc. - then here it be . Marvelous work ! Lets have another one . " ,10
" this wont win an Oscar but it won me over . this film is essentially a lark about by some guys from new Zealand and really that is all it is , I do n't think when they made the movie the filmmakers were thinking that this was going to be a world wide blockbuster or an intellectual indie thought provoker they simply made a movie that they thought would be fun and hoped that others would as well . I watch movies that are better than this on paper every day - if you break films down to their component parts - but sometimes , just sometimes you enjoy a movie for the sheer fun it gave you . This movie does n't have a 10 out of 10 script . this movie does n't have a 10 out of 10 score . this movie does n't have a 10 out of 10 cast . this movie does n't have a 10 out of 10 director . this movie does n't have a 10 out of 10 cinematographer . BUT ... This movie does give 10 out of 10 enjoyment !! There are some great pieces of dialogue and some good set pieces , yes some of the acting is wooden and some of the action-fighting sequences are a bit crappy but they are still 10 out of 10 enjoyable . Listening to some of the critics on this site and you would never watch anything . DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR SIT DOWN WATCH THIS WITH YOUR FAVOURITE POISON AND ENJOY !! No it is n't Shakespeare or Polanski or Hitchcock or even Michael Mann it just fun . " ,10
" Fast paced action with entertaining Tarantino style dialogue . . Do n't let the fact that this film is low budget put you off . I know it 's annoying to watch low budget films with it 's shaky camera action -LRB- which you do n't see that often in this film just a bit at the beginning with the bike -RRB- , but the story line and the dialogue in this film makes up for the fact that it 's low budget . The film moves at a fast pace and at no point was I bored . Now on the other hand if they had invested more in this film and shot it at a better location , I 'd say this would be a pretty big hit . If this was picked up by a major Hollywood production house , I 'd definitely give this film a 10\/10 . Thoroughly enjoyed the action and dialogue . " ,7
" Thoroughly enjoyed this . . I was n't expecting much from this film given the low ratings and was really just sitting back killing some time . However I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie very quickly became entertaining and humorous . Although it started a little slow , the pace picked right up and pulled me along with it . Rob and Mike worked well together and bought a real ` mates ' feel to the movie . It is n't often I laugh out loud but the guys antics and banter had me chuckling all the way through . The twists and turns and situation comedies had me laughing out loud and I have come away with four new faces to look out for in up and coming movies . Thank you for an entertaining hour and a half and would love to see more from this crew . :-RRB- " ,8
" Worth watching . Pretty good movie overall in the sense that the story keeps moving and there 's no soppy love scenes to slow things down . Acting was alright too and most of the actors \/ actresses were convincing . Ketzal 's outbursts and coined phrases added that little bit of humor and if you just watched it at face value , you 'd never have guessed the ending . Looks like this is a Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie in the making . Just too bad he did n't come up with anything like this after . I 've watched it a few times and will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a ` light ' movie or simply to find out what a knob jockey is . " ,8
" It was okay . Evil ? Err , okay , someone needs to get out more . The movie was okay in the sense that unlike all other New Zealand movies , it did n't try to dig into quirkiness that defines just about every other NZ movie out there - think genetically modified killer sheep . Watching it , I did get a little bored after about 30 minutes , but then I did a gear change and accepted it for what it was - a low budget , romp through Auckland , with some cheesy action and acting . The actors seemed enthusiastic , albeit quite wooden at times . There were a few laugh out loud moments - ie Mike making the chick disappear and the whole conversation in the dry cleaners - and there were some cringe moments as well - ie the scene with the kids mother . Watching an interview on TV , it seems that it was all done on a budget of $ 50,000 . Yeah , it was n't the best , and for a first effort action movie a little light on the action . Worth a watch if you are a Ketzal Sterling fan , from the days when he was doing High Octane - another cheesy product but TOTALLY appropriate for that market . " ,8
" Funny . Loved it , pretty hard edged . Lot 's of profanity . Not every bodies cup of tea I guess . Aimed squarely at the Playstation generation . If you like Grand Theft Auto then this film is right up your alley . I 'm certain our mum will hate it . I doubt your dad will like it either , but if you 're a young guy , and have a twisted sense of humor ... rent it now . The way they made it is amazing , shot half the film in one day . Steadicam shots are totally amazing . Some takes are nine minutes long . Lead actors are all brilliant , the dialog 's very natural , almost feels like adlib . That takes real talent . Dry Cleaners scene is legendary . " ,10
" Engaging . I saw this film at DeadCenter film festival in Oklahoma City . Connell has done a great job assembling a cast of interesting characters . This film is very funny but also shows the harder side of life for these background actors . The film is very engaging and keeps your attention from start to finish . The crew followed these actors for 8 months and then edited for over a year , and it shows . They have done a good job in showing growth in the film , and the editing of the story is excellent , with no voice-over and very little text required to pad the story . The actors are telling the story , and that 's what makes it interesting . Recommended ! " ,8
" Good Film !!! . Hollywood suits should be forced to see STRICTLY BACKGROUND to understand the honor , pathos and love of craft as evidenced by the background players featured in this film.The film has humor , desperation and hope.You will grow close to these individuals through their honesty and determination.In many ways the film mirrors life . You try to find something that fits you and you do your best . But your fate is in the hands of the movie gods . They hire and fire and if you 're lucky they promote you.This film is for everyone . You do not have to be a movie fan to enjoy the stories the film unfolds . As someone who has been an extra , director and producer I highly recommend STRICTLY BACKGROUND . " ,9
" Just another face . I just left a screening of Strictly Background at the New Hampshire Film Expo . This is one of the most sincere and touching documentaries I 've seen in a long time . The basic premise carries us to Hollywood and into the lives of Background Artists , or extras to us lay people . Extras are the truly unsung heroes of the movie business . Without background players , we would n't have movies . It 's a really simple film that gives an honest glimpse of the life these folks live . Some do it for fun , some do it to break into the `` Business , '' some do it for a few extra bucks . All the individuals interviewed have a true love of making movies , even if it 's as set dressing . As the movie progresses it 's informative of the movie making process , but at the same time it 's emotional in the sense that we are following the hopes and dreams of all these extras . Some make it , some do n't . One gentleman lives in a rented storage unit for $ 100 a month . We go to casting calls , jobs and `` specs '' , where an extra goes to a set in the hopes they might be needed that day . By the end of the movie I realized I was rooting for all of them to get that next job . The director did a great job of drawing us into these lives and the emotional roller-coaster that goes along with this kind of work . Not an easy task in our cynical society . It 's funny , interesting and at times heartbreaking . I highly recommend this film to any kind of cinema fan as well as anyone who is curious about the real Hollywood . " ,9
" Entertaining and informative film about the life of an extra . I saw this at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck , Michigan . Interesting documentary about people that make a career out of being movie extras . It followed ten people around and showed how they handle being another face in the movie crowd . I really enjoyed this film because I 'm interested in going into the film business and it would be fun to be an extra in at least one film . It was great seeing how dedicated some of these people are . The documentary covered many of the basics about being an extra . How to get cast in a film , how to dress , how to act around the big stars , and many other things . I also loved how they showed the film clips and pointed out where the stars of the documentary were . This movie will be really helpful to anyone that wants to travel out west and go into the movies . " ,8
" A must watch for want to be actors ! . As a retired High School Theatre teacher I wish I had this documentary to share with my students when I was still teaching . I always tried to explain to my students that only 1 % of want to be actors will become Brad Pitt famous . Most actors are just working actors . Some actors will become character actors and make a really nice living . But , this documentary focuses in on the Extras and gives a really great glimpse into the lives of the people who make up the crowd scenes in the movies and TV show everyday . It is a little long , it could have been about half an hour shorter but overall , it 's very informative , very touching , and very eye opening . I highly recommend this documentary . " ,8
" Interesting , but sad . . It was a little sad that these people wanted to be strictly background and they were so excited to get a 1 second of screen time . I think one of the cast of extra was mentally ill . Seriously . It basically showed how people could have no talent and still get into a movie . I 'm a real actor myself.And have had to train all my life for a bigbreak . I 've been in many speaking roles , and worked my ass off . This Documentary was almost sad , because itshowed people that wanted to get by with minimum work , and still get credit . One guy said he 's been in more than 200 films , Goerge Cloonly has n't done that many . It 's notreally fair to say you have done that many films , and have said or done nothing in them or worked for a little bit , apart from just putting on a outfit . Sad , sad , so very sad . " ,2
" Oddly compelling . This is one of the stranger documentaries I 've seen in some time and I was surprised that the film actually hooked me and kept my interest . It 's all about ten folks who are professional extras -- and from what I was able to gather , that is their only job ! Now considering how little it pays , it kept me wondering how they could afford to do this . Did they have spouses who supported them ? Were they living off inheritances ? I could see that in a few cases , they seemed to be living rather marginal lives . The film consists of lots of interviews and film clips with these people . As for the film clips , I really liked what the film makers did -- turn the prints black white and then colorize the featured extra so you can recognize them . Some of the interviews seemed very mundeane , some were moving and some made me laugh -LRB- such as the guy who seemed REALLY worried about doing gay roles -RRB- . A few other interesting things to look for : the Asian-American guy who ends up getting chosen to play , of all people , Abe Lincoln ! the big guy 's room -- you 'd think that he 'd clean it before the film crew arrived ... at least I HOPE he had n't cleaned it first ! The film is , at times , rather sad and moving . Several of the people seemed to lead very marginal existences and it 's easy to worry about them and their futures . These are odd folks , but the film does make you care about them . " ,7
" Contributing the the whole . This was one of my favorite films at the Santa Fe Film Festival . Director Connell presents us with a broad cast of dreamers and misfits . His sympathetic look at these ambitious and under-appreciated performers is moving and genuine . As a person who has been knocking at Hollywood 's doors for years I found myself a little frustrated by the film -- are my dreams folly ? -- but ultimately the message of the film has nothing to do with the sometimes ridiculous ambitions of its struggling protagonists but more with the importance of pursuing a dream , come what may . I was encouraged once to find out what I was crazy about and pursue it like a madman . Strictly Background shows us a group of die-hards who are doing just that - and their determination is inspiring . The movie will also change the way you watch movies . After watching the film it takes a long time to watch a movie without noticing the background -- is that a good thing ? Sure , there are no parts that do not contribute to the whole . " ,10

You really get to know and love these people , and if at first , you wondered why anyone would put themselves through the aggravation of all those cattle calls and cold calls , and useless callbacks , by the end of the movie , you realize the love that these extras have for the movie-making process . They 'll do anything to be a part of it , however small , brief , or fleeting . Director , Jason Connell , really captures the moments . He 's there for the disappointments and the heroic moments of these actors yes , the movie proves that even background players are truly actors . His use of clips from the feature films these extras have performed in is illuminating and hilarious . After spending time with the real characters in Strictly Background , you 'll want to know more about their lives and what happened after the cameras stopped rolling . Do I hear a sequel or a TV show coming Jason ? " ,10
" A Must See ! . `` Strictly Background '' is a great film ! Two thumbs way up ! There is a reason it has won so many awards and been featured at so many festivals . Director , Jason Connell does a good job of picking interesting characters to follow and then keeps the film moving . The music , editing and special effects also add to the momentum ! It really sheds light on the `` extras '' industry and shows the ups and downs of being in it . You really feel for these guys ! Finally these extras get to be the stars in this film . Bravo ! It 's all around fun ! It 's a must see ! Ca n't wait to see what Connell has up his sleeve for his next project . He 's one to keep an eye on ! " ,10
" Scissor Me Timbers ! . D-Yikes is definitely one of the stronger episodes of season 11 , funny , imaginative and intelligent , as always it 's hilarious and extremely enjoyable to watch . The episode revolves around Mrs. Garrison , at the beginning she is aggravated that her date blew off , because she was asked if she used to be a man . Later on she becomes friends with Allison , and is invited to her local bar `` LesBos '' , and proceeds to find out `` LesBos '' is actually a lesbian bar . It is at this point South Park start to mock the film `` 300 '' . Persians attempt to buy out `` lesBos '' , a reference to the Persians attacking the Spartans . Garrison kicks a Persian in the balls , a reference to when Leonidas kicks a Persian messenger down a hole , and ans many more . The episode is full of `` 300 '' style special effects , and is still remains hilarious . The dialogue is funny , written very well and just a well rounded good episode in my opinion . I give it 8\/10 " ,8
" Surprisingly Good . Usually around this time in the South Park run , the episodes get a little stale . However , I felt that D-Yikes was , while nothing special in the South Park spectrum , a well done episode . Herbert Garrison -LRB- now Janet -RRB- has been the shows most diverse character . He started as a straight man with a talking puppet -LRB- Mr. Hat -RRB- who hated gays , but eventually found he was gay -LRB- and in this process Mr. Hat disappeared -RRB- . Garrison stayed gay for several seasons , providing some great story points -LRB- Death Camp of Tolerance -RRB- . In season 9 , he was unfortunately made into a woman -LRB- or so he thought -RRB- , and eventually forced to stay . The Garrison character stopped being very funny , and now is actually amusing again . Now she 's a lesbian . Garrison , after being dumped again , meets a fellow female at Curves who brings her to the bar Les Bos -LRB- see the pun ? -RRB- , a lesbian bar . Garrison discovers `` scissoring , '' in the most graphic sex scene on South Park since Dawkins made love to Garrison last season . Then the show turns into a 300 spoof . I have to admit my feelings on this are very mixed . 300 is a rather easy target , and the jokes they make are fairly predictable . However , it is still funny to see how they dramatize things . Several times a character does something meaningless -LRB- like bite a chip -RRB- and the whole sequence slows down to emphasize the action . Garrison making coffee is probably the most inspired use , making fun of how 300 constantly goes to slow-mo for its action scenes . The whole Persian thing was a bit forced , but then I have to admit I did n't get the Persian joke -LRB- where they came from or what group they were making fun of , if any -RRB- . I wo n't speculate too long , but when Xerxes and Garrison scissor , it 's one of the funnier and more graphic scenes I 've seen . Very little is seen of the four boys , except when they hire Mexicans to help do their homework at write essays . The Mexicans think they mean Eses -LRB- I 'm not sure how spell that , but the latino slang for friend -RRB- and is one of the funnier moments of the episode . Otherwise the episode is n't anything special . It rises above the lice episode simply because it once again reinvents Garrison for the better this time -LRB- the Mayor 's reaction , `` You 're a lesbian now , '' is priceless -RRB- . Garrison is one of the most conceited characters to walk South Park 's screen , almost as bad as Cartman . Hopefully episode 7 will whet our appetites for what will come again in the future . We can only hope . " ,8
" Decent . I thought D-Yikes was a pretty decent South Park episode.It has Mr Garrison changing once again.It 's really funny , at the beginning of the series he started off as a straight -LRB- maybe in the closet -RRB- male , then he comes out of the closet as a homosexual male , then he got a sex change operation and became a straight female , then in this episode , she becomes a lesbian ! After she becomes a lesbian , she visits a bar where lesbians hang out called `` LesBos '' . But it is being bought by Persians and as a spoof of the movie `` 300 '' , the lesbians fight the persians while Garrison finds a secret of her own about the persian leader.It 's alright but not the best South Park episode . " ,8
" `` Scissor Me Timbers '' . A great Episode of South Park once again , Mr\/Mrs Garrison decides that she is a lesbian , going from a straight man , to a homosexual man , to a straight woman , Garrison has got to the sexual preference of lesbian . The episode is a spoof of the film 300 . cartman gets his friends to get their homework done by some Mexican immigrants which goes wrong . Once Garrison becomes a lesbian she goes to the `` girl Bar '' with her `` friend '' she met at the gym . They join with all the other girls to try and save there bar from being bought out Quite disturbing ending . My favorite quote `` scissor me timbers '' . 10\/10 " ,10
" Best Film I saw at Sundance\/Slamdance 2008 . So I 've never posted one of these User Comments , but I had to write about how much I loved this film . The story centers around the two very strong characters of Andy -LRB- Baruchel -RRB- and Reuben -LRB- Quaid -RRB- . The entire journey kept me captivated from beginning to end -LRB- which is no simple feat after a week of festival fatigue -RRB- but nothing prepared me for the ending . I have to say , without exaggeration , this film had one of the most perfect and moving conclusions of any film I 've ever seen . I wo n't give anything away here , but I find myself constantly tearing up and moved at the thought of what happens . Now , almost a day later , I still feel its messages and themes rushing through me . Not only is this ending so great , it will probably make a second viewing of this film an entirely different and even stronger experience . My hats off to the writer and director of this film . Damn good work . " ,10
" Best film I saw at Toronto International Film Festival . Real Time , the second feature of writer\/director Randall Cole -LRB- 19 Months -RRB- made its Canadian debut at the Toronto International Film Festival after being the opening night feature at the Slamdance Festival earlier this year . Opening with a twitchy , expletive-laden , nervous tirade , Ottawa 's Jay Baruchel -LRB- Knocked Up , Million Dollar Baby -RRB- gives the best performance of his young career as Andy Hayes ; a doomed gambling addict bemoaning his constant bad luck . Pulling up alongside Andy in his big black Town Car is Aussie ex-pat Reuben played by Randy Quaid -LRB- The Last Detail , Brokeback Mountain -RRB- who gives another in a long career filled with excellent performances . Glancing up at Reuben 's car , Andy quickly turns on his heel and walks in the opposite direction down the sidewalk to which Reuben calmly puts the car in reverse . Thus begins a hilarious pas-de-deux between man and car on a gray street in Hamilton . After a stern invitation , Andy reluctantly gets in the car where we discover that we will be spending much of the last hour and a half of his life with him . Quaid 's Reuben quietly explains that he has been given the assignment of killing Andy , but will give him until 3pm to get his affairs in order . Thus our adventure begins , with director Cole cleverly echoing Hal Ashby 's ` The Last Detail ' in which Quaid takes on the Nicholson role of guiding his young charge in the last moments before an inevitable fate is to befall him . Both of these character actors are clearly relishing the freedom afforded them by having lead roles in this excellent comedic drama . Quaid 's hit man is kind , thoughtful , and contemplative all the while simmering with potential violence , while occasionally flashing a glimpse of the goofy grin we first saw from him in Peter Bogdanovich 's ` The Last Picture Show ' . Baruchel brilliantly portrays the sadness all too common in people who choose not to engage beyond the perfunctory with the world at large . Even as events unfold in real time , there is a surreal timelessness evoked as we glide along dilapidated streets , with Reuben as our guide , while a radio station that will bring a smile to the lips of anyone who has a soft spot for 70s Can Con plays innocently along the way . With cats -LRB- both dead and alive -RRB- , unspeakable acts on potato salad , a somewhat addled shut-in Grandma -LRB- national treasure , Jayne Eastwood -RRB- and horizontal urination , there are plenty of laughs throughout ; despite the serious subject matter in Real Time . While the film is full of razor-sharp dialogue , writer\/director Cole also allows us space , as we are driven through the beautifully shot ugliness of The Hammer 's streets , in which Quaid Baruchel draw us into their messed up worlds , to this point in time . This thoughtful film invites us to examine how we choose to spend our time , as Andy contemplates a life that has lead him deep into a thick woods with Reuben 's gun at his back This film will stay with you long after the credits roll . You will be glad you spent these 79 minutes in Real Time . " ,10
" Best movie I 've seen this year . . I recently received a rare opportunity to view this film , and boy am I glad I did . I have never written up a review before , but after seeing this movie I feel like I have to . Just to help get the word out that it exists . The movie starts out with Andy , a complete and utter gambling addict , walking to the convenience store to buy a lottery ticket because he 's feeling lucky . He buys the ticket , loses , and decides to go to the racetrack . On his walk there he is approached by the other main character , Reuben , whom Andy owes a LOT of money . Reuben tells him to get in the car , and proceeds to explain to Andy that he is going to kill him today . However , Andy is a guy that Reuben has always been fond of , so Reuben decides to give him 1 hour to do whatever he wants and come to peace with his life , while staying under Reuben 's supervision of course . The rest of the movie is about Andy knowing for a fact that he is about to die and how he deals with it . I wo n't say any more , but I truly thought it had a beautiful ending . The movie starts off with a bang , but it does drag for a few minutes in the middle , which is why I knocked off a point . It quickly picks back up though , and the final 15 minutes will have you inches from your TV . I should also note that the movie starts out rather comedic , but the tone rapidly changes to drama . I felt that the trailer did n't really do it justice , as it focused on the comedy part a bit much . In fact , I almost wan na say do n't even bother with the trailer . The movie , as the title suggests , is completely shot in real time . This means that the 73ish minutes that you are sitting there are the exact minutes of Andy 's final hour -LRB- which is actually slightly over an hour -RRB- . You see every characters move , every turn of the vehicle , and hear every single word spoken . Fortunately , this is a good thing as the dialogue is excellent , so the car rides on the longer side are n't boring . After the movie movie ended , I have n't been able to stop thinking about it ... which kind of stinks because I do n't know anybody else who has seen it and I ca n't talk about it ! So here I am , a couple days later , writing a review in hopes of getting the word of this movie out there . The story is great , the dialogue is great , the acting is great , and it 's a unique approach to film . My bet is that word of this one will catch on real quick and we 'll be seeing it in theaters stateside within the year . " ,9
" Great film . i watched this and OMG a great movie , a great ending . A sublime movie within a movie after you see it once and the ending you have to watch it again , the first time you see it tells you a whole new movie now that you know , you watch it again and see it from a different perspective . is a bit slow to start of and there is no action like most Hollywood dumps that are coming out , but if you want to see a great story this film will entertain you . Hollywood should do more like this VION - Virtual Internet Online Navagitor " ,9
" A small work that works . 2008 has been a stinker for films - it seems nothing has gelled or been original - was Wall.E really the highlight !?!? - so Real Time for me was kind of a nicer way to finish the year . This is a tiny film - totally focused on the two main characters that just works . The enforcer , in a great turn by Randy Quaid , is there to kill a pathetic gambler , Andy , played by Canadian Jay Baruchel . What makes this is the conversations , nothing Tarantino-like , but somehow they involve us and make us care . At only 1 hour and 17 minutes this is short , but very well directed and most of all it is logical , neat , and the performances ring true . Honestly , one of the better films of the year , and I would recommend it as being a refreshing change from some of the garbage we 've been served this year . " ,8
" Outstanding . Not sure which movie rstone and prake saw , but it could n't have been the same one I did . To be fair this movie probably is n't everyone 's cup of tea . It 's not a ` Fast and the Furious ' action film . It 's not a ` Quantum of Solace ' suspense film either . It 's about a guy , Andy - played by Jay Baruchel , that has thrown his life away by getting hooked on gambling . Baruchel plays the part with the same desperation of addicts striving for one more fix , be it a drug , alcohol , or gambling . And he nails the way that his character seems to point the finger about the way his life turned out everywhere but at himself . It 's also about the guy , Rueben - played by Quaid , that takes the job to kill him . I wo n't lie and tel you I came expecting anything other than am action suspense flick . What I found instead was a story that was marvelously crafted in the 78-odd minutes . I became immersed in it . I cared about the characters , the loser Andy and the rough breaks he had that really just came from his own actions and choices in life , and the solemn enforcer Rueben , tasked with killing someone he knows but determined to give him one chance to , in an hour or so , to make something good . You get some humor , some gun play , but instead of relying on the quick and cheap thrills to make his point , the director relies on the way you are invested in the story to make the film . And you do become invested in it . Maybe it 's just that I lost my wife in Dec 2007 to a one car accident that makes me a little introspective when it comes to movies where impending death is the main theme and your choices or ability to choose what you do with your time left are integral to the story . I might not vote this one number one for 2008 , but it would definitely be in my top ten . And it was definitely worth the watch . " ,9
" one of the best !! . i would have voted 15 if possible , randy Q. shows a side of acting i had failed to see , i knew he was a fine character actor , always supporting but he is the mac . Daddy in this excellent film there are so many gems in this film and make no mistake its a gem , follywood dumbs us down so much that movies like this stand out like light in the night . I wont give you details . this film must be seen at least 2 times , like one poster said i am the only one around me that has seen this movie and i cant talk about it , acting by all is top notch . This film shows us that a great film can be made without blowing up a car with massive blood shed , involving armies , and corrupt police , This film touched me i will buy it keep it view it " ,10
" Smart melancholic drama filled with clever dialog . . Smart melancholic drama filled with clever dialog . Randy Quaid shows his chops as tough as nails hit man with a secret and Jay Baruchel is convincing as a beyond hope gambler with nothing to lose . The plot is uneventful but the chemistry between these two characters carries the story to its clever end . A brief appearance by Jayne Eastwood as Andy 's grandmother helps to carry the films theme of luck vs self determination in a short but enjoyable scene . I walked away feeling rewarded for my patience and thinking just a little . Good stuff . " ,8
" Interesting . Jay Baruchel is really been sort of a supporting guy in most of his movies like Tropic Thunder and Knocked Up . On the TV series Undeclared he was the main star , but as for the big screen he has n't gotten a big break . I will admit that I did n't check this out because of Jay , but really instead because of Randy Quaid . Quaid was the only funny part of the recent Balls Out : Gary the Tennis Coach movie and he had me hysterically laughing throughout Kingpin . All in all he is a pretty funny guy . This movie actually appears in a less comedic way and actually appeals as a drama flick . Even though I found this movie to be a little off I still found it to be pretty interesting and not bad to watch just once . So if you need to kill some time then check this one out . 7\/10 " ,7
" actors actually acting . not a movie for people who want to see special effects and visual wonderment ! this is a movie for people that seek actors acting with a great script and dialog ! do n't expect fancy camera work but do expect to see two capable actors in demanding roles . when i first started this movie i was very put off by the antics of Baruchel and the weird mystery of Quaid . for sure i thought this was a down hill flick - i was very wrong . the deeper you get into the plot the more involved one becomes with the young boy and his one and one-half hours before meeting his fate . as other reviewers noted the accent of the Quaid character seems completely unnecessary and pointless . but after some thought maybe the accent is the key to the relationship between Andy and Reuben . it created a gap , a chasm , that must be there for Reuben to be believable as a man who is only nice to Andy to achieve his appointed mission . the sudden twist in the story did not come as a surprise but the realizing of it and the happening of it are almost simultaneous . catch this flick - it 's something to remember ! " ,9
" Just what is lucky ? . I met Randy Quaid many years ago , when I was bartending at a bar in Toronto . I was surprised to see how very tall he was , and felt a little nervous around someone with so much physical presence . Truth is , he 's a pussycat . But not in this film ! Mr Quaid 's presence is massive , and I mean that in the best way . His laconic Aussie is frightening from his first entry into this two-hander , and he ably sustains that looming , brooding character right through to the end of the film . Along with Jay Baruchel , another terrific actor born to play this role , the pressure begins with our initial encounter of hit-man and loser , and never lets up . I have to say that I 'm glad that I saw this film , and the level of acting showcased - with major props to Jayne Eastwood , a Canadian acting legend , whom I 've followed for decades - should be mandatory viewing for aspiring actors\/actresses who want to see what a great actor can do with a great role , and the right acting chops . As an aside , the soundtrack of mainly Canadian musical stars of the 70 's adds a melancholy , nostalgic feel to the experience . Amongst the musicians showcased are the Jive Five -LRB- What Time is It ? -RRB- ; Abraham 's Children -LRB- Goodbye , Farewell -RRB- ; LightHouse -LRB- One Fine Morning -RRB- ; The Stampeders -LRB- Sweet City Woman -RRB- ; Chilliwack -LRB- Fly by Night -RRB- ; Trooper -LRB- Two for the Show -RRB- ; and The Tragically Hip -LRB- Scared -RRB- . Also used to great effect are Nilssen 's -LRB- Without You -RRB- and a taste of Erik Satie 's Gymnopedies # 1 . This film will make you think . It may make you reconsider what ` luck ' is . And it may make you see your world a little differently than it looked at the beginning of the day . To quote Ruben 's character -LRB- Quaid -RRB- ; Actually walking away at the right moment - how often do we do that ? " ,9
" Wow ... just ... wow ... . This one hurt . And I 'm usually a sucker for really bad Twister ripoffs made for cable . We 've seen this plot before , twice . Estranged parent-child relationship , because said parent is too devoted to chasing that big storm . Parent is obsessed with storms because of a tragedy in their childhood . Parent predicts The Big One will hit right where estranged child lives . Child does n't believe them . Child has has several tense emo moments with parent . Big tornado predictably hits , key characters survive , and everyone is happy . See `` Devil Winds '' and `` Tornado Warning '' for this by - the-numbers plot as well . Amusingly , they use global warming for an excuse to `` move '' Tornado Alley to the pacific northwest so they could shoot cheaply in Vancouver . As expected , the tornado effects are lackluster . The CGI crew just rendered the same tornado for every scene . I think what really got to me was the darkness of the movie . By that I do not mean a grim undertone to the story ... but rather how literally dark the image was throughout . I spent a lot of time straining to make out various details like character faces and locales . The environment around a tornado can be very dark , but this was done throughout the movie . I can only recommend this to people who did n't think it could get any worse than Atomic Twister . " ,1
" just about the stupidest movie ever . I 'm a storm chaser , which means I 'm usually avid for any sort of storm-disaster movie , no matter how stupid . But this one not only wasted the fifteen minutes I spent watching it , it 's compelling me to waste yet more time writing this review . That 's how strongly I feel about it . In this day and age , with so many weather websites available , there 's no excuse whatsoever for a writer not to go see what a tornado looks like on radar -- clue : It 's not a hurricane ! And FYI , storms do not growl . Chasers and storm fans and TV watchers , oh my , do yourself a favor and rent Twister again instead . " ,1
" I Ca n't Even Laugh , This is So Horrible . The premise of this show is completely unrealistic . And it rips off other movies , such as `` Twister '' and really bad shows like `` Night of the Twisters . '' Mimi Rogers basically plays the same character Helen Hunt played in `` Twister '' ; someone who experienced a family death during a tornado when she was younger . Now she 's obsessed with storms . But she has to prove `` the big one '' is coming . Plus , the science is in no way based on fact . Tornado Alley CAN NOT `` move '' to Seattle . Where were the fact checkers for this show ? But what should one expect - it IS `` Lifetime '' channel . So watch something better . Like an old-fashioned test pattern . " ,1
" Shoulda killed this dog before it was in the can ... A very fifty-something-looking Mimi Rogers cast as a thirty-something college prof is just the FIRST of many absurd incongruities that make this film hard to stomach . Much of the script and action are so completely inane that suspending disbelief enough to enjoy the story for its timely dramatic premise is just not do-able . For example , we cut in one scene to the lead -LRB- Mimi Rogers ' -RRB- character 's teenaged daughter sitting forlornly in front of her school , which -- despite its rather formidable-looking concrete and steel construction -- has just been torn to shreds by a not particularly strong tornado . Even though mom arrived minutes after the tornado hit -LRB- and had to evade a police roadblock to do so -RRB- the daughter -- who had , by the way , ignored an earlier cellphone message from weather-guru mom warning of the impending twister -- tears a strip off mom , apparently for not being there with her while the school was being torn apart -LRB- `` Where were you ? I was here by myself ! I was sooooo embarrassed ! '' -RRB- " ,1
" Run for Your Life ! .

They family stops and tries to save him , leading to even more tragedy Presently , storm tracking professional Mimi Rogers -LRB- as grown-up April Saunders -RRB- specializes in the study of tornadoes and how to manage them safely .

" Not bad at all . I liked Storm Cell a lot , it was emotional and i was glued to my TV while watching . Other movies of its genre have terrible and unrealistic effects , and besides the occasional unrealistic effects in this movie , it seemed real . Yet , its not always about the effects , and how good they are , because the acting in this movie was superb . A lot of emotions were shown and castes out well . I liked the beginning of the movie , it gave the movie a good opening . I felt that the cast were very suitable with their characters , Mimi Rogers did a great job as the mother , she was very understandable , but also gave the movie a good backbone . There was a specific type of mood in this movie , it was a very dull mood , but it was thrilling too , because you cant stop watching . There are some good syfy movies out there , but this one had the best acting out of all that i have seen in them . I recommend it to any ` end of the world ' movie addicts , fans of Mimi Rogers , but mostly those who want to watch a nice action\/drama ! " ,7
" Not a disaster movie , just a disaster . Bad acting , bad plot , bad special effects , bad science ; this movie has it all . If it were worse it might qualify as so bad it 's good but alas . One of the overarching problems of this movie was that it had so many subplots that it could n't focus on any of them and constantly jumped between parts that had little or nothing to do with each other . Much of the plot -LRB- and I use the term loosely -RRB- of this movie is ripped off from Twister , quite blatantly in at least two scenes . It somehow manages to make the elements from Twister into something almost silly . Of course this movie tries to explore the common plot of the parent ignoring her child by obsessing over work , but it does n't even pull that off . Considering that April knows what is going on in a life-threatening situation , it would have been wrong of her not to become involved . Rather than an uninvolved parent who favors work over family , I got the impression of a concerned scientist surrounded by morons . Dana is not sympathetic at all , but comes across as overly demanding and bratty . Then there is the old romance with Travis the meteorologist , which was just thrown in . The revelation that he is Dana 's father could have made for an interesting plot , had it not come up at the most random point in the movie , been forgotten almost as soon as it was mentioned , and not brought up again until the very end . This was on top of the fact that it was so predictable that I initially dismissed the notion . The earlier part of the movie , introduced after the death of April 's parents , seems to have simply been thrown in and really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie . Global warming is discussed in this early sequence but is n't mentioned again . Then there is the student who accompanies April on the chase . He is introduced as if he is going to be a major character , only to be never seen or mentioned again after April goes to Washington . The special effects were cheesy . The CGI was about the same quality as you 'll see in home-made animations . The tornadoes were basically the same funnel copied and pasted into different scenes . Some of the satellite images show clouds swirling to one of the most basic effects of photoshop . Movies more than a decade older than this easily surpass the effects of this one . The quality of science in Storm Cell makes Twister look like a documentary . Among other things , the tornadoes were spinning the wrong way , the titular storm cell looked more like a hurricane spinning the wrong way -LRB- except for one scene -RRB- , and weather maps that did n't make any sense . Somewhere a meteorologist is crying . Strangely , the way people took cover was fairly accurate which leads me to suspect that the research for this movie did not go any further than a quick google search of tornado safety . It is a bad movie in every area . The plot is fragmented into unrelated pieces , the acting and effects are cheap and cheesy , and the science is an unfunny joke . " ,1
" If this movie was meant to send up a storm , then I am as angry as thunder and lightning ! . Now I actually wanted to like this movie . I was n't expecting much from Storm Cell , but no way was I expecting it to be this bad . It does n't even look good , with wretched scenery , further disadvantaged by dull lighting , unfocused editing , awkward camera work and cheap tornado effects , even more cheapened by sound effects that are just as disturbing as those in the Gene Dietch Tom and Jerry cartoons . The story is predictable and utterly ridiculous , with scientific errors that make even the worst SyFy disaster movie credible in comparison -LRB- and their disaster movies are riddled with those -RRB- , the script is unnatural in both dialogue and the delivery of it and cheesy to the point you get toothache from gritting your teeth and the characters are either annoying or uninteresting . The acting is also wooden , with Mimi Rogers looking uncomfortable with her hard-edged persona here coming across as forced . Overall , a terrible movie , not in about two months now have I been so angry watching a movie . People will say that they get novelty value , but most assets are so badly done and inexcusably that I could n't find myself entertained . 0\/10 Bethany Cox " ,1
" Horrible Acting , Horrible Plot , and Sexist . This movie is dreadful . It has a boring plot , seeded with clich ; horribly written dialogue ; and acting that is equivalent to a high school film project or a local commercial . There 's even an unnecessary lost father bit thrown in that ties up at the end when the father says to his daughter that 's a long story . It 's even sexist . The selfish daughter runs away from home to get attention , punches a guy in the face , and he 's carted off to jail for it ; I wish she was caught by the tornado and impaled on a telephone pole -- then the story would have made sense . The only thing good about this movie are the storm graphics which are fairly well done , but even this is ruined by the sound effects -- stock monster groans that are repeated over and over again . Perhaps having the storm sound like a demon would have been effective if -LRB- 1 -RRB- they used something I have n't heard before in every monster movie or video game I 've ever watched or played , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- they played it only once and very quietly so it 's a subtle comment on how nature can sometimes mirror the hellish nightmares we thought were confined to our imaginations , not my Spooktastic Halloween Sound Effects Vol . 2 CD stuck on the part where the werewolf attacks .

" A great movie , it kept me on the edge of my seat . . Actually , I found the movie quite interesting . It was exciting , thrilling and while not quite factual , it kept my attention . Sure it was not real , no sci-fi movies are and their not meant to be . The story is about an adult women who experienced a life changing tragedy as a very young girl that killed both her parents and now she feel compelled to try and help others who could be caught in a life changing event in today 's world . Forecasters today are like fortune tellers . Always predicting some type of weather that will happen but never able to accurately predict where it will happen . They say there is a fifty percent chance of rain which means it may rain or it may not . And they forecast that it may rain in your area but what they do n't tell you is how big of an area they are referring to . They really tell us a lot . This movie is full of advanced wizardry and special computer effects which provide the viewer with a more real life view of what forecasters wish technology would provide them instead of having to guess at raw data readings when predicting the weather . I lived in Florida for the past 19 years where forecasters claimed we should prepare for the worst during hurricane season . The retailers loved it as we would always run out and spend our money buying hurricane supplies only to have the storm go else where . Sorry people , but this is not a reality show nor is it supposed to accurate show what forecasters really do . Its science fiction drama meant to keep people interested in the fake movie plot and now that I 've recorded it , I intend to keep it for future viewing . The water spout that formed on the lake which turned into a tornado was especially interesting , kind of reminders me of Andrew back in 92 . Been there , done that . " ,8
" Beautifully shot but slow and unfocused . This film is about a woman who lost her husband and son in a terror attack . Her life goes into a mess as she deals with her loss and hunts for the truth . I have mixed feelings for Incendiary . On one hand , it is beautifully shot . Every scene is nicely planned and constructed . Camera work is great too . On the other hand , the plot is confusing and strange . The pacing is excruciatingly slow , with a lot of repetitive scenes -LRB- such as London burning -RRB- . I also think Incendiary is not focused enough , as it tries to deal with too many topics including grief , guilt , quest for truth and the road to healing . If the filmmakers only focused on grief and guilt , without the subplots of the anti-terrorist guy or the suspect 's family , I would have enjoyed the film more . Despite of Michelle Williams ' superb acting , I find Incendiary disappointing and boring . " ,4
" Everyone is a critic ! . I have seen a negative review on this movie and I have to say that I am very tired of people picking apart movies to show how smart they think they are ! This was a tragic and beautifully filmed movie that reminded me so much of The Sweet Hereafter . I believe that some people have a hard time watching others go through tragedy and grief and are uncomfortable expressing themselves . This movie drew a lump to my throat the size of a golf ball and made me hug my son extra hard at bedtime . Michelle Williams gives another outstanding performance and Ewan MacGregor is , as always , a complete pleasure to watch on screen . This film will come out on DVD this year and I would urge anyone with a heart to embrace it . " ,8
" expectations . . . i think the main problem with the movie is n't the movie , it 's that people are going in expecting a thriller instead of a drama . yes the major plot points could be covered in 5 minutes . . but that 's not the point of drama . your average thriller is about things that happen and happen to have people in them . this movie is about the people and how they feel and cope when something momentous happens . if you appreciate that you 'll appreciate the movie better , or not watch it cos it 's not something that appeals to you . . and that 's fair enough . As far as the film goes , Michelle Williams carries it well . The accent 's fine and the various states she goes through as she tries to deal with what has happened never feel you leaving disconnected or not understanding how she got there . McGregor is his usual charming self , tho his is not really a major part -LRB- likewise MacFadyen -RRB- , this is a movie about the mother and so these two do n't get an awful lot of screen time . The one fault i 'd say is that the passage of time is not particularly well expressed particularly right at the end of the film when what seems to be a present day Ewan is wearing the exact same outfit as in the next scene which must be set sometime after . Regardless , it 's a decent movie , but requiring empathy . . so if you prefer action flicks , watch something else . " ,8
" Sharon Maguire should stick to comedy and not sappy melodrama . I was at the premiere of this film last night at the Sundance Film Festival . It was obvious that Sharon was very nervous , but she was gracious and funny and I could see how that transferred to her film Bridget Jones 's Diary which I loved . This , however , could n't be further removed from that . To use one of Sharon 's own terms , as a friend put it , the whole film was `` eggy '' . Overdone , pleading with the audience to cry for sympathy for the main character . I do n't really even know where to start . The little boy was adorable and precocious , almost to the point of being cartoon-like . Michelle Williams ' hangdog `` I 'm sad and smoking a cigarette '' schtick soon became old . The film starts out alright enough , with the setup of the husband who 's always working , the connection between mother and son , etc. . Suddenly she is in bed with the very on-point Ewan McGregor , and a bomb explodes at the soccer stadium where her husband and son are . This moment is good - frightening , shocking . But the heavy overlays of jaunting piano music and slow motion running or crying or whatever are so saturated that it 's impossible to really connect . As most of us know , symbolism is best when subtle and stripped down . Well be prepared to have it wacked over your head in this film . Her son has a stuffed bunny animal that he always carries , and after he 's dead of course this becomes the representation of her son . They reference the bunny so many times that it 's no longer a special memento . Once she starts stalking the son of one of the suicide bombers , it just fails to make sense any longer . She predictably bonds with the son out of nowhere -LRB- I literally leaned over and said `` She 's going to buy him a cricket bat '' to a friend after the boy mentioned his dad was supposed to buy him one for his birthday ... and lo and behold , she did -RRB- and then suddenly there 's a standoff at the train station where she gets apparently shot in the head and has not a scratch to show for it . An additional thing that bothered me is her character apparently has all these amazing traits that men are dying for . Ewan seems suddenly `` turned around '' from a womanizing yuppie telling her that she 's just so different from everyone he knows . Her husband 's old boss tells her she 's an amazing woman and spews ridiculous romantic crap about `` laying in a caravan with the dust particles in the air '' or `` taking all the hundreds of pieces of your broken heart and putting it back together '' . What is so remarkable about this woman ? She 's just gone through a terrible loss , but that has nothing to do with her character or personality . Nothing shown tells me that she is deserving of this attention . This combined with the in and out narration , apparently letters dedicated to Osama Bin Laden , the hot-air balloon with the picture of her son , the underuse of the engaging Ewan McGregor character , the random relationship with the bomber 's son , and the obvious `` Oscar nomination '' scene of Michelle Williams screaming `` My baby ! My baby ! '' all comes together for one totally over the top melodrama that leaves the viewer with no real connection to anyone . If they had stripped it down by about 90 % it would be watchable . It does make me sad that I found this film so unenjoyable , because it was obvious that the director was very nervous and had put her soul and time into it 's making . However , I do n't see any way to fix the many glaring issues there are . Instead of seeing this , I would recommend popping in Bridget Jones 's Diary and enjoying Sharon Maguire in her best medium .

" Terrorism in London . A young beautiful woman -LRB- Michelle Williams -RRB- is trapped in an empty marriage tucked away in an ugly apartment block in London . Her pride and joy in her gray existence is her 4-year-old son . One day , as the two of them are at the football match , she seduces a slick journalist Jasper -LRB- Ewan McGregor -RRB- in the local pub . As fate would have it , they are locked in a lovers embrace , with the football match raging on behind them on TV , when the stadium going up in flames with a series of explosions . Her husband and son are both killed in the terrorist attack , leaving her broken and alone . If you are now thinking that a film about the aftermath of a major terrorist attack from the director of Brigit Jones ' Diary sounds like a recipe for disaster , then you are partly right . But it is not bad for the reason you might think . The film is , for the most part , an emotional roller - coaster - you could be crying your way through most of it . But not because of her grieving for her lost family . The bombs are just the beginning - she still has to endure a full load of unlikely events in the hour to come . She understandably loses it along the way as the story becomes so over-dramatised that it is just ridiculous -LRB- especially when you run the story back in your head afterwards -RRB- . Towards the end she enters a phase of grief hallucination and reconciliation with life . As the movie is neither funny nor exciting , this should have been the route to take all along . Concentrating on the mourning of the young mother , and perhaps even throwing in some guilt towards her semi-estranged husband . Her husband is just gone with his death . He is not missed nor is there any regret for his disappearance . Even for a semi-estranged husband this sounds a little harsh - she did worry about him , after all , so she must have felt something . It is also curious that they have no family , or friends who drop by to comfort her . A lonely marriage must have pushed them into some kind of a social circle , or a hobby , or at least the occasional phone call with their mothers . Was their life really that lonely . The movie is clearly intended as a pamphlet against terrorism , by showing the human cost at the level of ordinary people . It also takes the time to explain the resilience of London in a voice-over . It is a little desperate to save a movie through nationalism , but can actually be fit in here , although it could have been better prepared , by , for instance , by making her a more integral part of London . This is no masterpiece , nor an entertainment jewel , and can easily be missed altogether . A pity , because it does have some potential . " ,4
" The Amazingly Brilliant Michelle Williams - How Does She Do It ? . Having knocked us all out in 2004 in LAND OF PLENTY by Wim Wenders , here Michelle Williams proves that she is truly supernatural . She gives one of the most gut-wrenching performances ever seen on the screen . And for a Montana gal who had to brush the sagebrush pollen out of her hair before joining polite company , stow her lasso , and pretend to be civilised , how did she manage to master the accent and rhythms and patterns of speech , dress , and mannerisms of those real savages , the gals in those short tart 's skirts who live in tower blocks in East London and are married to men who support Arsenal Football Club ? -LRB- Ugh ! Football ! Makes me sick ! And singing about a football club , how oafish can you get ? -RRB- It all goes to show that Williams , like good wine , travels well , even though in this case it was from planet to planet . This film is so brilliantly written and directed by Sharon Maguire -LRB- formerly a television documentary film maker -RRB- that the combination of Maguire and Williams sets the cinema on fire and thereby justifies the film 's title admirably . Excellent support is had from Ewan McGregor and Matthew MacFadyen as the two male leads , but all eyes are on Williams . The production values of this film are very high , and it is easy to be convinced that the big terrorist attack on Wembley Stadium has really happened , as the attack and the aftermath are all so real . However , this is not a film about terrorism , which is merely the backdrop , in the sense that world wars and civil wars have been for so many films in the past , from GONE WITH THE WIND to FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS to MRS. MINIVER . This is a film about people , but especially about Michelle Williams . Only a woman could have directed this . In fact , one is tempted to say that all films with terrorism backgrounds should be directed by women , because they are not tempted as men are to dwell on all the violence for its own sake . With a woman at the helm , this film becomes a people film , but a man would have strayed , taken more interest in guns and corpses and explosions -LRB- little boys going bang bang sometimes never grow up , especially when they have a budget and a cameraman handed to them -RRB- . As a study of searing grief and despair , Williams has our hearts in her mouth , but do n't worry , it is n't really a downer , it is simply so spellbinding looking at her and seeing into another dimension . She seems to be a tiny little thing , and it is almost inconceivable that such a small package can carry such a huge explosive power . This film really is an instant contemporary classic . " ,10
" Incendiary `` to cause fire - explosive '' . A heart wrenching movie . Though none of us are free from grief and quilt , some may find this movie too emotional . But for all who venture here , you may find your mind pondering your own lives and loved ones and those closest to you . You may start to think just how fragile we all are . You may consider calling someone , writing someone or praying for someone . Some of you may take a closer look at world events , read a newspaper or for that matter avoid one . But if you watch this movie you will feel the need to preform some action of good faith , if not just looking at your own . I found the shocking scenes in this movie did not shock me and the sad thing is they should have . Tomorrow when I look out the window , walk down the street , have a cup of coffee . I will savor the moment with more awareness and thankfulness . As Leonard Cohen said `` It 's through the cracks that the light gets in '' " ,9
" Awful ! . Incredibly slow . Long periods when they did n't find dialogue so filled it with repetitive monotonous piano music . A plot with a good center but too many twists or ` devices ' to be believable . Because of the tenuous plot , characters are more difficult to relate to or care about . Too many themes \/ subjects . So I did n't like it much ! I thought the above was a succinct review but now IMDb is making me write 10 lines , which is ironically similar to how I feel about the film actually given all the long slow panoramic shots over music while the actors look sad or longingly or suchlike . So yes this paragraph is just for that end , sorry everyone , but this review is less time than the film , so it 's of some value . Ha ! " ,1
" Underrated and misunderstood ... . At times difficult to watch drama functions brilliantly as showcase for Michelle Williams -LRB- the best performance of hers that I have yet seen -RRB- and an all too vivid examination of the perils and scars of living in the oh so dangerous and unsettled modern world . Previous comments labeling the film melodramatic and unconvincing seem very off base to me . I agree that this material MIGHT have been pat and soap opera-ish in other hands , but for me the emotional and physical drama are riveting and superbly realized . I will admit to some reservations about Williams 's accent in early scenes ... but soon became totally drawn in by the conviction of her performance . She is matched by a beautifully chosen and directed supporting cast . All in all a very unfairly overlooked film with a very important message which should resonate deeply with anyone willing to open their heart to it . " ,7
" It 's not that bad ... . This film has been maligned because the director previously directed a Bridget Jones movie . Yes , those movies were shallow , but this film Incendiary has a few decent points , and Michelle Williams is worth watching . Basically a neglected housewife who 's son and husband are in a soccer match in Chelsea when an act of terrorism is committed . The daily life scenes as we see her apartment and her husbands UN-glamorous job as a bomb prevention specialist are realistic . The beach scenes with her little boy are relate-able without being overly dramatic . The letter to Osama suggested by a hospital nurse is a ridiculous statement to say to a grieving mother who has lost her son and husband . Especially in a random act of terrorism . No doubt anyone who has lost a loved one will agree with this . The grief Michelle Williams emotes is believable here , she is alienated and dissociated from the world around her . Yes the scene with the stuffed rabbit is a ploy we have seen , but it is believable . A person in this situation is not going to sit in group therapy and want to share all the pain and horror they have just witnessed . The pain is at first internalized and sometimes hidden from the outside world . The Ewan McGregor character , who has an affair with the grieving mother at the time the incident occurs , seems to be added in at the last minute and extraneous . Other than driving her to the scene of the bombing and visiting her once at the hospital he does not seem to contribute very much to the overall story . The visuals are very good , the gritty streets of London and the building she lives in , versus the Welllington building of the upper class . The story itself is worth watching and Michelle Williams gives a sympathetic and nice understated performance here . Do n't discount this film . Recommended . 8\/10 . " ,8
" Unnecessarily complicated storyline . I just rented this yesterday without knowing anything about it beforehand . I sincerely think that it is an awfully bad film . I read a few of the reviews posted and can not agree with the reviewers that say that if you do n't like this movie you are either an idiot , a zombie or who someone who likes action films and -LRB- evidently in their opinion -RRB- can not understand anything else . If we are here to discuss -LRB- or comment -RRB- about movies let 's just do so . Here are my plus points : good acting all around , good photography . Here are my minus points : 1 -RRB- Unnecessarily complicated storyline . If you take away the Ewan McGregor character and the affair with the policeman , the story , which regards a woman losing her husband and child in a terrorist attack in London , would still stand-up and probably have been more focused . Did they need to make the movie longer just to reach 90mins ? 2 -RRB- Some characters are not believable . How does Ewan McGregor get to own an Aston Martin etc ? Someone commented who cares about the car . I would n't care but in films , if you have something that does n't fit-in with the character it makes you think that maybe there is a reason for it then you start thinking what that reason could it be and , will running after butterflies , you lose focus on the principal storyline which I think is the drama of a woman losing her child in a bomb attack and everything else that goes with it . . Given that for some reason this character had to be in the film , if he had a Ford -LRB- for example -RRB- I think it would have been much better . By the way , for once I think that the Italian title is much more apt : translated it means without apparent reason which I believe answers the question of why this film was made . " ,1
" Take your heart and wring it out carelessly ... a drippy abusive flop . Incendiary -LRB- 2008 -RRB- A kind of British version of 9\/11 that is interesting for its vision of a London-based terrorist disaster , but which is overwrought , sentimental , and sensational . It tries to temper this by making the heroine moodily -LRB- deeply -RRB- unhappy in her adultery -LRB- or unhappy enough to be adulterous -RRB- , and by having the resulting relationship take on surprising seriousness . And this is where the movie has some interest . I 'm not sure Michelle William 's role as the mother and bereaved is exceptional any more than Ewan McGregor is as the interloper playboy turned sensitive -LRB- and who has a really minor role -RRB- . Both seem like functionary clich s. It 's a serious movie overall , and increasingly sad . But it 's loaded with tricks to make it catchy , including the whole unconvincing second half where an investigation takes place against unlikely odds . The music is overbearing -LRB- drippy strings and piano -RRB- , and the manipulations almost cheap -LRB- stuffed animals , pictures and movies of loved ones -RRB- , almost like a quickie made-for-TV affair . Which is too bad because there are other aspects that are moving . It 's a good idea to have the British visit this and try to empathize through a movie this way . A giveaway to its motivations -LRB- and those of the director Sharon Maguire -RRB- is a voice-over at the end , as a baby is being born , that is a direct plea to Osama Bin Laden to stop training people to be violent killers . We all wish that would be so . So if this movie is just for Osama , fine . For the rest of us , it 's nearly unbearably trite and shameless . " ,3
" The Many Faces of Terrorism . INCENDIARY comes as a surprise release on DVD : did it even have a theatrical release ? Based on a book by Chris Cleave and adapted for the screen by director Sharon Maguire , this little film is notable on many levels . First , the story is another look at the topic of terrorism , revealing the effects of these senseless catastrophes much like America 's 9\/11 tragedy on all players - the survivors of the victims , the survivors of the perpetrators , and the way so much of life changes in the wake of explosive surprises and the strength to survive in the aftermath of these traumas . A Young Mother -LRB- an astonishingly fine performance by Michelle Williams -RRB- opens the film with thoughts and demonstrations of the love she holds for her young son -LRB- Sidney Johnson -RRB- while she copes with the too frequent absences of her husband Lenny -LRB- Nicholas Gleaves -RRB- : Lenny is part of London 's Anti-terrorism division of the police force . The feeling of unfulfilled desires by this isolated young woman are magnified as she watches her newspaper reporter neighbor Jasper Black -LRB- Ewan McEwan -RRB- across the street escorting yet another tipsy dolly into his apartment . Lenny leaves , the mother lovingly puts her son to bed , then she goes out to a bar where she encounters none other than Jasper trying to tempt her to his lair . The needy mother submits to Jasper 's intentions and in a brief moment of desire succumbs to her physical needs . Another day passes and as Lenny and their son depart for the soccer game , the mother is again willingly seduced by Jasper , only to have their assignation interrupted by an explosion at the stadium where Lenny and her son are watching the game . The guilt-ridden adulterous mother flees to the stadium where she is injured attempting to find her family . Now hospitalized with injuries she faces visits from Jasper as well as from her husband 's co - worker Terrance -LRB- Matthew Macfadyen -RRB- . Once released form the hospital she discovers the withheld name and picture of one of the suicide bombers responsible for the attack and deaths - and she learns that the bomber was a suspect being watched by Terrance who could possibly have prevented her loss . She learns the name of the suicide bomber 's family , meets the bomber 's son -LRB- Usman Khokhar -RRB- and wife -LRB- Sasha Behar -RRB- and eventually allows herself to meet them . The consequences of all of this information and chance meetings and the afterburn of her association with Jasper and Terrance -LRB- both of whom profess love for her -RRB- make for a startling ending , but an ending that for once helps us understand the psychology of our current world of terrorism threat and the need to heal and move on . The performances are excellent , with special attention paid to the gifts of Michelle Williams whose perfect British accent will be a surprise to most viewers : this is a career altering role for her . The film develops slowly , deals with a lot of internal dialog , but in the end the effect is one of powerful impact . Highly recommended . Grady Harp " ,8
" The movie ruined the story . You should definitely read the book instead . Some of the characters of great importance for the story is either written out or payed no attention to in the movie . Which is really a pity and also twists the basic story so it will never reach the level the books does . I was well disappointed as well to see an American actress hold the leading role . A Dawsons Creek actress - how did they ever come up with that ? When the book was to come out , the big attack in London occurred and due to the many similarities of the fictive story and what happened in real life , they had to take the retract the book and postpone it 's release for a year or so . I very much recommend the book , but the movie will only ruin it for you . " ,2
" Intolerable . An adulterous British woman tries to cope with the loss of her husband and infant son to a terrorist bombing at a soccer match . This film is a complete disaster , failing on all levels . The main problem is a script that seems to have no rhyme or reason and becomes increasingly dreary . The woman suffers from delusions and has random relationships with a reporter and a colleague of her husband 's , but none of it is the least bit interesting . Williams is certainly a talented young actress but this is arguably her worst performance . She sports a thick Cockney accent that may be authentic sounding , but is also annoying and nearly incomprehensible . " ,1
" People are missing a lot . Minor spoilers : This movie is about coming to terms with guilt and grief . Michelle must come to terms with cheating on her husband , who she still loves . Ewan , has to decide whether or not publish his expose on the bombings . And Matthew must come to grips with loving the wife of a co-worker he -LRB- unwittingly -RRB- sent to his death . How do we deal with grief and guilt wrapped into one ? She was told to write a letter to Osama -LRB- grief -RRB- , which actually organized her thoughts . It made it easier for her to realize that while much was taken from her that day , it was not the end of her . She almost committed suicide , but decided it was better to live than to give up . In the end , this resilience makes us stronger . Strong enough to defeat those cowards who think they can terrorize us . Matthew Macfadyen has the hardest role , because he is holding all the secrets . Knowing what he did , he 's still drawn to Michelle . He ca n't help himself . Seeing her in the park , he gives the impression that he had been looking for her for weeks . He continues to seek out Michelle , even though he realizes that if she found out what he did , it would be the end of any fledgling relationship . Ewan , is drawn to Michelle because he escaped death that day . If he had not cheated on his girlfriend by sleeping with Michelle again , he would have been killed . He desires her , but also is grateful to her for saving his life . He also enlists her help in getting information on the terrorist , via the terrorists family . Then he finds out things that he knows will only hurt her further . Does he publish what he knows or not ? Imo , a very good movie , with a fantastic cast and complex issues . " ,9
" Excellent British film Makes a change from usual US tripe . . Quite a surprise , topical clever and compulsive viewing . This film did run true to life in many ways , the characters are easy to identify with . The housewife sexually unsatisfied by her husband who apparently arrives home from a very stressful job of work and immediately falls asleep . The impression being that this is a regular occurrence . I was a bit puzzled though by the facial damage on a person who had ` nt been to the match . Much of this film required intelligent imagination as it did ` nt waste its time filling in what they thought was unnecessary detail . I 'm sure many of those involved in terrorist incidents in London over the past 30 odd years will identify with one character or another . It 's a pity it has ` nt gained the popularity it deserves now being released to TV only a year after production . Some very good acting by the 2 lead parts . " ,10
" Misleading . The thing I abhor most about selecting an unfamiliar movie from the rental or bargain bins is being lied to by the copywriters who decorate the DVD case with descriptions that have nothing to do with the movie . This film was the last straw and I will no longer choose movies I know nothing about based on the cover blurbs . I was in the mood for a thriller - the most prominent word on the DVD case - and the promise of a gripping terrorist theme with a woman at the center of a police investigation was right up my alley . Instead , I was presented with a somber , slow moving , often disjointed story with weak character development and periodic attempts at artistic visuals . Though all of the acting was very good , it did not make up for the empty plot tangents that dragged down the pace nor did it improve the frequent sappy dialog . This movie is one long whine about a lonely woman 's grief and guilt , a supposedly very ordinary woman who nevertheless is the object of desire of many men and who has not even one relative or friend in the world . Despite the hopeful ending , a sad movie that really does n't take you anywhere or reveal any new insights means I 've wasted my time . Only 2 out of 10 stars for the acting and the cinematography . " ,2
" Very sad , yet at some points awful ! . The story of a woman grieving over the loss of her husband and son , seems like a story that should not be told , it felt like every scene was just watching her crying and having flashbacks . On the other hand , scenes were very well done , and clear at some points , very good special effects too . I have to say though , this is by far the worst movie I have seen , or at least , I can recall seeing . The whole story looks like repetition , and then the mystery to be revealed of how everything happened is very badly done , it is easily guessed , not in any way clever , and pointless . I do not recommend this movie to anyone , it is appalling . " ,3
" Cleverly plotted star-vehicle , and Williams fully delivers . . This is clearly a film about guilt , both hers and his -LRB- and the coppers ' -RRB- , and dealing with grief and death of loved ones . The fact that there is some sort of institutionalized screw ups is n't there to show conspiracy , but to show that we all messed up at times . The references to the shooting\/execution by the police of the innocent Brazilian in the subway after 7\/7 are clear and intentional . This is a great film , I really dunno what everybody is on about . Aside from the whole accent thing -LRB- we know that Williams ' accent is fake , it is not perfect , but adequate . If we had n't known that she was an American , most of the non-Brits would 've never guessed -RRB- this is a near flawless film , story-wise . Williams again , delivers on the acting skills . She has been a very talented actress since childhood , whose talent can be obscured by her astonishing beauty . It can be more of an obstacle to her work , than an asset . Sometimes . Oh well . Even Michelle Williams ca n't have it all ... ;-RRB- The Melancholic Alcoholic . PS My father always told me to be wary of reviewers who label their object of review as one which is \* multi-layered \* in a negative tone -LRB- the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis , according to some Time-Out hack -RRB- . It tells you one thing : That these reviewers have problems with understanding complex issues . Phrases like this film does n't know what it wants to be etc. , might 've sounded ` phat ! ' ten years ago , but are sooooooo nineties . Especially if said reviewers get essential story details wrong , one should be very mistrustful about their supposed skills , and whether they have actually SEEN the film in the first place . I 'm referring of course , to the mother 's meeting with the bombers son , which was of course , the completely logical conclusion of the journalists ' actions , which themselves were borne out of a desire to win the mother back , which was totally understandable because of his guilt and her being highly attractive AND a damsel in distress , too . " ,9
" Very good melodrama . First , let me say that I 'm not usually into these types of film . I prefer the popcorn movies with lots of action and not too much to think about . Every once in a while , however , I 'll rent a high-brow movie and often I am bored to tears . Not with this movie . I am unfamiliar with most of Michelle Williams work , but she does an excellent job here displaying a woman dealing with a deep guilt , and remorse over the loss of her son -LRB- she does n't seem to miss her husband much , however - but I digress -RRB- . I honestly believe that if you can not relate to her character here , then you are a soul-less creature and definitely have forgotten the tragedies of 9-11-2001 . Terrorism is just murder on a grand scale , and murder benefits no one . Grief is universal . Go back into your caves and let those who still have the capacity to feel relish in the tragedy portrayed by an up-and coming actress . See this one ! " ,7
" Masterful inward looking piece full of emotion and insight . I actually find myself pitying the clowns who do n't get\/won ' t get this film . They are either brain dead or dead at the core ... because not being touched by the events strung together here is really not paying attention to the film or to the current state of things . The acting is superb by everyone , obviously especially Michelle Williams . It 's a gutsy move to bring in an American to play this blue collar East Ender but she pulled it off with astonishing aplomb . The photography is sensational and helps the emotional story emerge ... that is , if you 're interested in a story that deals in emotions , which is to say people , which is to say drama . If you do n't want drama or people or emotions this is not the film for you . Perhaps no film is for you , but fear not , there are video games for you . " ,8
" Not melodrama meaning bad but melodrama meaning good . I went home and really appreciated the time I could spend with my young son after watching this . We played in the garden for at least an hour longer , everything he did was so much more vivid than if I had not watched this film . Many people have mentioned ` Melodrama ' in their comments but usually with a sneer . Melodrama is not necessary a bad thing , it has a place if used well . This is a film about grief directed in the same manner as Bridget Jones . People who enjoyed Bridget Jones , Love Actually etc will find an emotional wrench with the mothers strength and weakness , as I did . A Mike Leigh type director would have made a very different film but that movie would have been unrelenting and harrowing by being much closer to the real life experiences of people suffering loss . I believe the filmmakers heart is in the right place and is not purposefully manipulating her audience . It must have taken much persistence and a strong belief to get this movie made , I imaging that it had a bumpy ride to get green lit . I 'm glad they succeeded . " ,7
" Darkest Hours . In the wake of destruction , the world falls into silence , and memories of those lost flicker across flames , whispers in bleeding hearts , and love taken rises up to heaven to tell of how they lived and how they will never be forgotten . But how do you live after something like this ? How does the heart heal , and how do you let go ? How do you live , and would you ever be able to love again ? Love is the perfect memory that clings to your heart when the world is brought to its knees , and life refuses to surrender . Jagged pieces of what would never be again cuts deep , but time fights to pull it back together . And the world finds a way to rise up once more , and the heart rebuilds . But love might be denied , and love lost may be found . And the strength of one woman in her darkest hour lights up through the tremendous talent of Michelle Williams , and the fires of drama burn bright . And the intensity of the heart grips us deep in this chilling movie , Incendiary . " ,10
" Reply to Steve Carver . It never seems for me to find some obscure film from the U.K. or even here in America that places itself in a situation simple human nature . You ran on and compared this modern day tragedy to Bridget Jones Diary . Personally I detest the Bridget Jones Diary whereas in this film you find common day people catching themselves in a common day probable tragedy . The characters you mentioned played by Ewan MacGregor and Matthew Macfadayen , one who is not only caught in the candidness of Michelle Williams character , but also her husband 's Supervisor giving his personal tickets away to save his own carcass based on probabilities . I have suffered a modern day tragedy and if not for my family could easily seem myself wrapped up in my daughters personal items . Your complete and total insufferable ability to see the human nature side of this movie makes me wonder why you even watched it . I have many friends scattered throughout the UK and even a London Police Officer who speaks of the many things that happen on a daily work day for him . So perhaps you should climb out of your dungeon and take heart to the last words spoken in the letter to Mr. Osama . Because it is truly obvious you did not understand the plea to listen to the voices of the children and perhaps together we could speak of peace for it is the children that carry and must live in this shattered world we now live in . The movie was touching especially to one who has lost through accident or currently war related reasons . The issues they speak of in getting through the grief are true and do work for many . As I said before I am not one who would commit adultery but realize that people are different and suffer issues and can see clearly how such a transgression could have happen . It has been said that it is not man that preys on the broken heart of a woman but the evil within the man . " ,9
" What The ... ? . I 've got good news , I 've got bad news . The good ? Michelle is very fine - convincing sad mommy , Barbie cute , emoticon deluxe . E.McG - not around enough . There must have been an editing mess with this one . The first part of the film suggests he would have had a bigger role . Our loss . The bad ? THIS IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE !!!! It 's a ruminative , junky , maudlin , meandering mess masquerading as an action movie . No guts , no punch . It takes a long time to say - you will be half asleep at this point - that , gee , Osama should just listen to the sad mommas out there he would n't be such a bad dude . Aww ! NO . This is idiotic . Terrorists are NOT good daddies . Not possible . The whole thing takes a long time to develop then falls apart in bathetic babbling . " ,2
" Pretentious melodrama - slooow , boooring and clich - filled . An awful waste of 1 hour and 35 minutes . Do n't do this to yourself , unless you really enjoy pretentious melodramas with little or no story . According to the producers , and IMDb , this is a `` Drama\/Romance\/Thriller '' . Make no mistake - it is not romance , and most certainly not a thriller . `` Like watching paint dry '' is an old saying , and probably as meaningless a way of spending time as watching `` Incendiary '' . Still , many of us are likely never to have sat down for an hour and a half to watch paint dry , whereas we have all seen the clich es and the pretentious rubbish which makes up this utterly awful movie . We 've seen it all before , though fortunately rarely in such a mindblowingly slooow pace and without virtually any story or message behind it . I is usually a bad sign when , 20 minutes into a film , still nothing has happened , and the information conveyed would easily fit into less than a minute . In this case , it is indeed fully indicative of what 's to come : more of the same . The story as such can be told in it 's entirety in a few sentences and scenes , which in fact it also is - the remainder of the of the movie just consists of endless , clich d retrospectives , soul searching dialogs , marathon shots of facial expressions , you name it ... Some have criticized the plausibility and credibility of the storyline , very often a problem with today 's movies , but that 's hardly where this movie falls down - it 's in the fact that the story could easily have been told in ten minutes . It would still have been pointless , un-interesting and without meaning or message , but at least it would have been over quickly ... " ,1
" Incendiary lives up to its title . What nonsense negativism from Steve `` Cod '' Carver in his post which does not even seem to be aware that the script is directly adapted from the celebrated Chris Cleave novel of the same name published on the same day as London 's actual `` 7\/7 '' attacks in 2005 . This was one of my favorite 's from Sundance 2008 , and as an accredited film critic I am looking forward to the 25th anniversary edition in a few weeks time . I 'm now sorry I missed `` The Escapist '' at Sundance which has also not yet been released commercially this side of the Atlantic . Incendiary is the first in a string of excellent Michelle Williams ' performances , of which the best by far is in Wendy and Lucy . Comments here are always subjective . But when they slag others ' professional judgments on the basis of little knowledge of either cinema or the world , they should be kept to oneself . " ,9
" Did we see the same film ? . I had to wonder if I saw the same film as the other commentator as I thoroughly enjoyed it . Yes , this is an old storyline but I thought the story was credible , the actors did a good job and were believable and the locations were authentic . I see from the forum that it was actually shot in Albuquerque which makes it even better for me as I 'm unlikely to be lucky enough to visit the place myself . So to summarise , relatively unknown actors -LRB- except one -RRB- , no big budget special effects , simple storyline and yes it works . Just remember folks , biggest is n't always best , just like this comment , I 've said all I want to say but its not ten lines so I 've got to fill it out ! " ,8
" Not Without Flaws . Christian Slater released two films at approximately the same time , `` He Was a Quiet Man '' , and this particular piece . `` Love Lies Bleeding '' is a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde , but imagine Clyde as a miserably ignorant , somewhat philosophical `` nice guy '' . A young couple , Duke and Amber are living together on the wrong side of the tracks , dealing with poverty , crime , and general economic misfortune until coming upon a bag of money belonging to their drug-dealing neighbors . Also sought after by dirty cop Pollen , they go on the run to escape their depressing lives and find their dream life of a house with a yard and 2.5 children ... etc. . . Jenna Dewan is really developing quality acting skills , especially opposing Christian Slater 's frightening `` dirty cop '' routine . Christian Slater once again shows his talents and versatility -LRB- very obvious if going between this film and `` He Was a Quiet Man -RRB- . This was a fantastic role for him . Brian Geraghty was slightly over-done , but it suited the role -LRB- Iraq war-vet that did n't come home quite right -RRB- . Overall , this film was chock-full of stereotypes and stayed rather cookie-cutter and predictable throughout . However , it was entertaining , and kept you going right until the end . Hence my rating of 8\/10 . It 's not perfect by any means , but if you 're not looking for substance , it 's just a good entertaining film . " ,8
" Pathetic . This film was truly awful , its a shame i read a review saying it was like true romance , `` true romance being a 10 and this an 8 '' . As true romance is my favorite film i thought i 'd given it a go . I wish i 'd watched true romance instead . Christian Slater is the only good part in this film and the only reason he is in it is because he must be a bit hard up for cash . The whole way through this couple are disgustingly cheesy and its an extremely cringeworthy film to watch . Also i just kept thinking , why ? Why on earth would you do that ?! Hated it and cant believe i watched it till the end . I gave this film a 2 and to be honest even thats being a bit generous . I do n't blame the actors for the cheese in this film because they were n't overly that bad , but the writer , some lines were terrible . This film is nothing like TRUE ROMANCE . " ,2
" true romance . Every once in a blue moon a straight to DVD movie has the power to take me out of a drunken stooper and sober me up . This is one of those films . Flying onto DVD under the radar and under the recommendation from many customers I decided to check this little gem out . The cover art is pretty generic photoshop and unappealing . And the casting of Christian Slater does n't bode too well however kick ass Jenna Dewan of Step Up and Tamara and sexy Brian Geraghty in full on hunk mode does add a bit of intrigue . Despite them I still decided to avoid it at first . Boy I 'm glad I checked this movie out . A down on their luck good natured young couple come upon a bag full of dirty cop money . They flee with it and find themselves on the run from corrupt cops dealing with one bad turn after the next . Christian Slater is actually quite menacing as the films villain but the real treasures here are Dewan and Geraghty . Their chemistry is realistic and relatable . The movie falls into a True Romance type category and borrows heavily from that film and all those other Bonnie and Clyde type films like it . But the characters are very well drawn in this version and you really care about themPlus the performances are top notch and they are very likable . Here are two actors in desperate need of a deserving career . Both sexy and talented . I really wish this film would have been given a chance it 's much better than most released in theaters and is actually professionally made with a clean gritty look to it . It 's a shame that such a good film would be passed over because of lack of star power . But trust me it 's worth a look . It 's a prime hot rental at my job and from everyone whose renting it . it 's getting really good word of mouth . Hopefully that will give some credit to the talented people involved . \*\*\* .5 \/ 5 " ,8
" Not as great as true romance , but still good . If you are to chose between watching true romance and this movie ; chose true romance . I would give that movie 10\/10 and this movie 8\/10 . This is still a very good movie . Different movies leaves difference impressions on me : i sometimes watch movies that are highly rated on IMDb -LRB- like `` I am legend '' -RRB- and and is bored during the movie and afterward felt like i wasted a part of my life . This is not the case with Love Lies Bleeding . It is very exciting all the way , and balances the action with slower parts to actually produce an emotion of thriller to this viewer . The acting is decent , and i felt with the characters . They felt like normal people and not like unrealistic super humans that 's common these days in movies . The action part is not overdone and also feels realistic to me . " ,8
" Could have been so much better if the writer could write . I do n't see how anyone can give this film a good rating and to compare it favourably with True Romance is an insult to that movie and film-making in general . The plot is you 're standard ` couple stumble across wads of cash and go on the run ' . There 's nothing new in this story but that is not what makes it a bad film . What makes this cringe-worthy viewing is the absolutely sloppy writing . The characters -LRB- all of them -RRB- are made to do such stupid things like leaving bags of cash wide open for all to see , not once , not twice , not thrice ... And other things like buying a massively conspicuous getaway car , not locking a car with wads of cash in it . Our heroine in a maid 's uniform with a massive and fresh gash on her head allowed to walk past a Police checkpoint who are on the look out for such a person.The list is absolutely endless , and there 's even an apparently abandoned but fully functioning , rust and dereliction free power plant . I had given this 3\/10 but now that I 've written about it I realize that is too generous 2 is all it 's worth despite the odd amusing reference to True Romance that has been slipped in . " ,2
" heart racing storey . It 's been a while since I seen a good film , and this keeps you on the Edge of a the seat , There is not much I can say without spoiling the film , But a must see Movie it 's a constant flow of Romance , Action and Thriller throughout The film , I would give this a rating of 7 , because : A good story line , but nothing new it 's been done before , The ending was good , but could have been better `` they cut it too short '' There was also two actors that I personally fort they could not act for a toffee :-p But overall I was impress and would watch this film again given the choice . " ,7
" Dumb and Dumber without any laughs is just plain Stupid . . The lead characters are just plain stupid to the point that the plot is totally unbelievable . Almost every scene reeks of morbid stupidity making suspension of disbelief impossible except to wonder how bad can it be right to the end of this abysmal quagmire . I agree with anyone who hated this movie . Anyone who claims to like this movie must own shares in or be a shill for the production company . If not , please have your head examined , immediately . The character Duke is an absolute puke in this film . The actor who portrays him gives a Rassie worthy performance . I kept waiting for him to show something to no avail . I could n't bear to watch this stupidity right through to the end . I had to switch to another movie and switched back to see if this disastrous entity had any hope of redeeming itself in the end . It did n't . Dumb and Dumber make this the Dumbest movie I have ever seen and the least worthy of watching , ever . " ,1
" The worst movie I 've seen in as far back as I can remember , LITERALLY . . Spare yourself from this travesty . I do n't think I 've ever seen a movie this bad in my life , honestly . I do n't know what else I can tell you , but please , just avoid it . All I can muster is rhetoric , it 's REALLY JUST THAT BAD . Acting is awful -LRB- especially Brian Geraghty , who is always stone like for no apparent reason -RRB- , in fact , even Slater -LRB- which was a bit of a surprise -RRB- seems to struggle to play the role convincingly -LRB- it 's just too over the top retarded I suppose -RRB- . Dialogue is bland , cheesy , and just all around makes me cringe with every line . I still ca n't believe I watched the whole thing . It 's one of those movies that you want to turn off from the beginning . Predictable plot , sloppy and uninspired cinematography , etc. . It 's just all around poor . The way the characters flip-flop back and forth -LRB- about what to do with the money -RRB- when their lives are at stake is laughable . I will never write another review unless I see a movie poorer than this one . I would usually never write a review in the first place , but if I can spare someone 1.5 hours of their life then writing this will have been worth it . In fact , I am so disgusted by Brian Geraghty 's performance that I will never watch another movie that he is ever again . They should have just cast a sock puppet in his place instead . AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE ! " ,1
" Average Film . This film was average because it resembles True Romance too much . A couple looking to make a better life for themselves , stolen cash , bad guys and Christian Slater . The couple are in a rut , he finds some dirty money and the couple set off across the U.S. , get married and visit a casino . Bent cops then chase them to get their money . Local law enforcers get involved and a whole load of people all get shot . The likeness to True Romance was evident from the start and the constant ' I love you ' between the couple added to this . However , it was n't as good as True Romance and the fact that it seemed like it was meant to be just like true romance made it worse.But worth a watch if not doing much else . The film was very average and to be honest not worth talking a whole lot about . Having said that , to grade it a 2 out of 10 is unfair and it deserves around a 4 . If True Romance had never been made then it may achieve a 6 or 7 . " ,4
" Good Drama , Action and a Thriller . They say that blood money is never good and this movie proves just that . Duke and Amber , a young couple who are engaged , are struggling to survive , when one night a corrupt cop , who will stop at nothing to get his money back , shoots their neighbor , who are also a bunch of thugs who had looted the house several times in order to finance their habits . On the night concerned , Duke , who has purchased a gun , upon returning , finds the thugs dead and the corrupt cop wounded on the floor . He takes the money and informs his fianc e that they are moving . Directed by Keith Samples , written by Brian Strassman , Love Lies Bleeding stars Christian Slater , Jenna Dewan and Brian Geraghty . This is like modern day `` Bonnie and Clyde '' with the exception that there 's emotions involved . But never the less it still manages to captivate audience attention and it is worth watching . Conclusion : A good one to watch . " ,8
" Enjoyable B-Movie . I have to start by saying , like most others have said , this movie is very similar to my all time favorite movie , True Romance , however , its still a good movie and i do n't think you will waste your time watching it . Obviously the acting could have been better , but it was n't ALL that bad , i still have a lump in my throat as well , i WOULD recommend this movie to anyone , and give it a chance , do n't just watch the first 10 minutes and think , why am i watching this , it does get better and i give it an 8\/10 . It was strange seeing Slater play the opposite of Clarence Worley -LRB- his character in True Romance -RRB- but you do get used to it . " ,8
" How many movies the industry will do with the same script ? . I do n't know what Christian Slater is doing on a movie like this , his career must be as bad as it gets . The plot is old , simplistic and do n't go anywhere so the director had to make this non sense scenes where nothing happens just to waste more of our time . I rented because I had a credit to get a movie free and because Christian Slater was on the cover , so I thought this could be a nice movie , nothing too good but at least a regular movie.I have to say that I 'm thankful that I did n't spent money on this . The main character is the most stupid person I 've ever seen and sometimes I even cheer for him to be caught . If you have n't seen this movie yet , do n't lost 90 minutes of your life with it , I did and I regret it ! " ,2
" Good little B movie . . Good low budget exploitation film has an Iraq war vet trying to get buy in a bad neighborhood . When his house is robbed by the local bad guys , he goes to get his stuff back and walks into the aftermath of a bloody shoot out over drug money . He takes the money , grabs his girlfriend and runs . Unfortunately the money belonged to a crooked DEA agent and he wants the money back . I never heard of this film before I stumbled on it and the presence of Christian Slater as the bad DEA agent was the reason I picked it up . Slater is quite good as the bad guy and he makes watching this film a great deal of fun since its a nice break from his normal heroic screen persona . The action is well done and keeps your interest . The cast sells what is a run of the mill plot making this a perfect film for a rainy afternoon . If there is any flaw its that the film feels a bit too much like True Romance at times . Perhaps its Slater , perhaps its other things , but more than one I asked myself why they bothered copying Tarantino when the film works so well on its own terms . Worth a look . " ,7
" to a new low . This awkward piece of celluloid garbage was allowed to escape the cutting room floor . The directors , producers , production company could have done so much better . The actors should have been shot on the spot . This is not the level of incompetence we want to release to the public . I have seen better on a county college film school . Not to be nasty , but you have to get nasty to the people who release this type of manure . High in nitrates , carries across three fields , able to induce DiarrhEEEAR !! get a video camera , invite your friends over , and drink some beer ; you can do a better job yourselves . " ,1
" Not a very good thriller ... . When ex-con Geraghty comes home one day to find his home ransacked -LRB- again -RRB- and his girl -LRB- Dewan -RRB- roughed up by gang bangers , he 's had enough . When he decides to take matters into his own hands , he shows up at the scene of a shootout over a bag of money left lying on the floor . After grabbing the money and running . He figures a safe distance away and starts to settle down , only to find bad guy psychotic Slater on his trail . The genre categories on this film are stated as action , drama , and thrills . As for action , very little ; drama , more than what should be in any action film ; and thrills ? Well , no thrills here , especially for someone who does n't , ordinarily , like movies like this . As for some of the leads , Geraghty did n't pull off his character , at least I did n't believe him and when did Dewan grow up ? In two years , she 's gone from high school ballet student in `` Step Up '' to high school teacher -LRB- ?!?!?! -RRB- in `` Fab 5 : The Texas Cheerleader Story '' and this one , where she 's just a kid again starting out on life 's journey . Slater was always a favorite of mine , but I just could not believe that he 's happy with this performance . Whoever taught him who act as a psycho on the edge should give him a refund -LRB- or at least change for that dime he charged Slater for the acting lessons -RRB- . Overall , the premise was good , but the acting was not . Three bad acting jobs takes three stars away from what WAS a good story line . 7 out of 10 stars . " ,7

" Money Changes Everything . I recently purchased Love Lies Bleeding because I 'm a fan of Jenna Dewan and Christian Slater . This movie was a decent suspense thriller and I loved every minute of it . Jenna Dewan -LRB- Tamara and Step Up -RRB- and Brian Geraghty -LRB- I Know Who Killed Me and Cruel World -RRB- star as a married teenage couple , who have a rough life , until he finds a bag of money . So they take the money and flee to Las Vegas to have a proper wedding . Everything is going great until Christian Slater -LRB- Alone in the Dark -RRB- and his people show up to claim the money . He plays a good psychopath in this flick , as he hunts the young couple to get back the millions of dollars of drug money . This movie was awesome and scary and suspenseful . I definitely recommend this to anyone who comes across it . " ,10
" Wow , I do n't believe I watched this till the end . This is my first review as I felt compelled to write to say just how bad this film is . The acting is awful . The direction is awful and this type of storyline has been done to death . What was Christian Slater thinking ? I always watch films to the end of the titles but I was sooo glad when the , `` Action '' , finished , I could n't bear to see the names associated with this monstrosity . If you have 94 minutes to spare , just go and stare at a wall , you may find it more entertaining . " ,3
" Fresh Charming . Experimental cinema at its best . This is by far one of the freshest Mexican features in recent years . The film is also a very personal journey for Jonas Cuaron . Even though the film might scare some people because it is composed of only pictures and dialog . A coming of age film , that reveals itself photo after photo , and a very funny approach to the Mexican and American cultures . Always charming , almost improvised , the voices are top notch , weird and sometimes distracting , but very intimate indeed . Few flaws in here , more than a movie , it 's an experience . I had personally only seen this format previously used by Chris Marker . A very good debut film by Jonas , with only $ 8,000 dollars as its budget . 9\/10 Carlos Reyes , Cine Azteca " ,10
" An experience of time in a highly intimate and original style . Who said that one must have a screen play first and then add the images to make a film ? How about having visual images first and then thinking about what narrative can build out of the images ? Well , the Mexican director Jon s Cuar n 's first feature A O U A is exactly such an experiment . This , however , is not the only refreshing aspect of this film . Unlike other experimental films which can be disturbing , A O U A demonstrates that an experimental film can simultaneously be light -LRB- a love story between a horny teenage Mexican boy Diego and a twenty-something American girl Molly -RRB- and personal -LRB- Diego is Cuar n 's younger half-brother and Molly Cuar n 's girlfriend -RRB- . With thousands of pictures he took during a year of his life but no prewritten script , Cuar n was totally free to compose the narrative . Viewers have to remain patient for the first few minutes -LRB- as the film begins slowly with a sequence of his beautifully shot photos -RRB- before the story gradually unfolds . By literally imposing a fictional narrative onto reality -LRB- spontaneous slices of daily lives -RRB- , Cuar n 's A O U A makes us rethink the relationship between fabrication and reality . Composed of only photographs and dialogues , A O U A is probably not considered a film . Strictly it is not a film . It is more than a film , as it offers us an experience of time in a highly intimate and original style . The delightfully funny comments about the cultural differences between America and Mexico as well as about growing up are assets of the film . " ,9
" The only thing of merit to this film is the concept . I really expected to like this film . I love a lot of foreign cinema ; I have a real soft spot for coming-of-age movies ; I enjoy slower paced storytelling ; and I 'm happy to spend time with interesting characters even when there 's not a lot happening in a film . ... But I only managed to sit through half of this before I just got so frustrated with it I had to turn it off . I know that only sitting through half of it does n't really qualify me to pass comment on the film as a whole , but what I saw was so incredibly tedious that I could n't bring myself to watch the rest of it . The voice acting was unconvincing , the characters were two dimensional - and not especially likable - and I have to disagree with the other people who have commented and say that I did n't even find the photography especially impressive . As a project , compiling a year or so of photographs into a sequence that could be presented as a narrative is quite an interesting idea , and this could have been quite a sweet short film . However , there were points where the story that had been attached to the images seemed so lazy and simplistic -LRB- it reminded me of Christine Jesperson 's art projects in ` Me And You And Everyone We Know ' in places -RRB- , that the final product did n't fulfil it 's potential . And I just do n't think there was enough to it to justify a feature-length run time . If you have n't seen the film already , some alternatives I would recommend seeing instead are ` How The Garcia Girls Spent Their Summer ' , ` Duck Season ' and ` XXY ' . " ,3
" Truly Original , Espectacular Debut ! . Jon s Cuar n seems to find his role as a director in his spectacular debut `` A o U a '' -LRB- Nail Year -RRB- , who tells the story about a girl form USA and a boy from Mexico who fall in love during an awful summer . I was really impressed with the movie because it he told the story with a completely original and fresh concept based in only photographs . Such a challenge ! ... This will not be the first thing we 're gon na watch of him , so lets put all eyes on , he have such a great talent ! The voice performances of the actors who lead them were astonishing when the main thing to pay attention to is to your ear -LRB- very clever -RRB- . This movie was premiered during the XXII Guadalajara International Film Festival 2007 . " ,10
" Surprising . A friend of mine recommended that I watch this movie . I was n't expecting too much going in to it since there was nobody that I recognized in the cast and it seemed to be a very independent made film . After watching it however I was pretty surprised and can honestly say that I do n't hate it . The cover was very misleading , making it seem much more than what it was . The movie was pretty straight forward two guys MacManus and Cain have to find there missing superior Cross and uncover the reason for why he went missing , there is a pretty cool twist at the end but that is pretty much it . If you have a couple hours to kill then take a look you probably wo n't end up killing yourself after it 's over . " ,7
" Well Done . I have seen movies before on this type on budget and Garrison most certainly exceeds its expectations . If you are expecting some huge military film then I would not recommend this movie for you . There are hardly any type of battle scenes and the ones that are shown are very small in scale . There are some interesting scenes throughout the film that do come as a pleasant surprise . I would still recommend this movie since the acting and overall story line keeps you watching until the end . I gave it an 8 because it was apparent that this film was made with no money , and any film on the military and PTSD has my vote . " ,8
" an important topic film . An important topic film , but execution , style , music and a plethora of other tidbits make this whole project miss what is being sold here . The cast stated this movie has touched lives , and granted the Bragg killings are tragic - but this was not the film to be touting anything to do with those incidents . Some solid military performances and a conveyance of a believable Garrison lifestyle give this the stars I gave it - so maybe go into it to see this group 's take on the daily lifestyle portrayed , with a violent domestic subplot appearing at the end and beginning . The special features give this an extra bump for the amount added onto this small budget film\/DVD . " ,10
" Good Indie ... . Garrison is loosely based on a series of murders committed at Fort Bragg , by returned US soldiers from Iraq in 2002 . Veteran Sgt. Daniel McManus -LRB- Kerry Valderrama -RRB- is ordered to track down a missing comrade in arms , eventually coming into conflict with a deeply damaged man whose life McManus once saved . This surprisingly impressive low budgeter is a commentary on the forgotten soldiers of modern warfare who have been abandoned by their government , as well as a look at the juggling of a family life and a military career - which , in this case , does not end well . First-time director\/writer\/star Kerry Valderrama -LRB- obviously creating opportunities for himself after starring in largely B-grade fare like Doctor S Battles The Sex Crazed Zombies ! -RRB- delivers a solid piece of film-making , with interesting plot twists and convincing performances . He does , however , dip a few too many times into the big and truly dog-eared book of US military clich s - complete with brutally aggressive staff sergeants and suffering recruits . Apart from this , the plot is filled with enough suspense , mystery and evenly placed social commentary to keep audiences enthralled . " ,10
" A must see for all soldiers !!! . It is apparent that most of the reviews on here are by people that pardon my language have no @ % $ \* @ # idea about what they are talking about !!! As a soldier currently serving my third tour in Iraq as an 11B , Garrison in my opinion was written flawlessly . I could n't help but laugh at a lot in some cases , especially the chem light batteries , hazing and MOUT training scenes . It brought back some really funny and terrible memories . Garrison captures how tough , silly , and despite what the other MOS 's think , intelligent infantrymen are , especially Paratroopers . Garrison really moved me , because I know what its like to go through infidelity and if it was n't for a great team leader and a bad-ass squad leader at the time , I might never have recovered . Garrison is the first truly accurate film of modern military life , both the good and the horrible parts of it . A must see for all military soldiers . " ,10
" Independent film tries too hard to be an independent film and ends up being not very good . After returning from a tour in Iraq , two soldiers attempt to track down their squad leader who has gone AWOL before something terrible happens . Based on some killings in Fort Bragg this is a a good but not great little film thats hurt by a directorial style that makes the film seem like any number of recent independent films . Some people have called it the Sundance look , which is a style of film making that some people adopt to get noticed at a film festival . I 'm sure it helps to assure that their film gets seen because its the look that film festival organizers seem to like , but for me a member of the paying audience I find it more on the order of lacking in creativity . I would think it has less to do with Sundance and more to the fact that film schools are turning out filmmakers who are all clones cut with the same cookie cutter . Watch any number of independent films and you see that Garrison blends in with them seamlessly . Its a shame because the story is a good one , even if the pay off is announced at the opening . Recommended only for those who do n't watch a large number of independent films . " ,4
" Its the little things that count . . So why ca n't they get the simplest things correct in this movie , for instance the unit insignias on the shoulders which no one is wearing , and no combat insignias either , cause everyone is wearing cib with wreath , so you know they have been in combat . And the fact in some scenes you see some of the actors not not wearing there covers or hats , probably for the fact so you can see there face better , wearing a mp3 during a company run , I mean please , such inaccuracies are just horrible and disrespectful , so it was a low budget film , but these are just simple things that so easy to get right but yet like so many other films they screw them up totally and portray the military as idiots . " ,1
" A very underrated film . I really wish more big budget films was like Garrison . It was a very entertaining film , no Oscar winner to be sure but still very entertaining with a good story and decent acting for a bunch of unknowns . Also it captures the feel of military life I think as well . Maybe because i 'm a vet , i 'm biased but I think the film did a great job of that . For any veterans I DEFINITELY recommend . Even for people who have never been in the military I think they 'd enjoy it . It was based off the 2002 Fort Benning murders and I think it handled the sensitive subject matter very well while still making it an interesting mystery film to watch . Overall a not a bad 1 hour and 25 minutes spent for me . Definitely a recommend . " ,7
" Worst movie ever made ! Terrible script , horrendous acting , and very bad cinematography ! . I hardly ever review movies but I cant believe how bad this movie was . I just moved to a new apartment and do n't have internet yet so I went to blockbuster to rent some movies . This was one of them . I love movies about the military , and war flicks so I thought this one would be promising . What a waste of time . It was very painful to watch this , but I kept on at it to give the film the benefit of the doubt . Felt like shooting myself in the head by the time I turned it off . What a waste ! There are a lot of garbage films out there but nothing made me cringe as much as this one did . The music they used was absolutely horrible as well ! Here we have a a group of soldiers doing their workouts and in the background they have this emo\/screemo song playing that sounds like a twelve year old girl screaming her little teenage heart out ! Who in gods name chose the music for this film ? This has to be the gayest attempt at making a military related film . I take offense to that crap ! " ,1
" A well-intentioned attempt at no frills filmmaking . I read that writer \/ director Kerry Valerrama was a former soldier and OEF veteran , so I allowed myself to hope that someone had actually made a realistic film about life in the post-September 11th army . Unfortunately , I was bound to be disappointed . This is essentially a very low budget murder mystery that tackles a few serious issues in passing , but does n't reach to the core of those issues . The film is about a platoon from the 82nd Airborne -LRB- an 82nd patch is briefly seen on McManus ' shoulder but then disappears in the same scene -RRB- , and contains three interwoven stories . The main narrative is about Sergeant McManus and Sergeant Cain searching for their AWOL squad leader , who suffers from PTSD and has been abusing his wife . We see glimpses of McManus ' home life , and how he rarely sees his family because he is always at work . There is also a b-story about three brand new Privates who are being hazed , which is mostly played for laughs -LRB- and it 's very similar to how I was treated at my first unit -RRB- . Most of the performances are underwhelming , although the actors who portrayed the Platoon Sergeant , Cross , and Machine stood out . They were the only ones who left an impression . The storyline meanders along but is mildly entertaining . There is a twist ending , which I will try not to spoil here . It somewhat makes sense , because Cross felt like he owed McManus his life and wanted to protect him . The denouement is also intentionally ambiguous , but these plot turns come across as a tad bit exploitive since the film is based on a real incident . First time director Valderrama displays a nice cinematic flourish by introducing characters with type-written name and rank information , but he overuses this device and unnecessarily introduces too many minor characters with it . The direction and editing of the opening credits , and the use of music , was also well done . Considering that this film was made for very little money , it 's impressive that he pulled it off . There are some amateurish directing moments -LRB- the three soldiers kicking the bouncer -RRB- but overall he acquits himself well as a low budget film maker . The moment where Cross taps the gas can with his pistol was creepy and well realized , as was the image of him eating popcorn in the rain . I ca n't cover all of the many -LRB- MANY -RRB- uniform and technical inaccuracies here , but they stand out and are very distracting . I understand that uniform appearances may have to be altered for legal reasons , but American flags on both shoulders ? And I was amused that Valderrama forgot what MOUT actually stands for . Is this a realistic look at the lives of soldiers ? Eh , kinda . The characters are pretty thin and I ca n't say that I really identified with them . There was one nice moment in the jeep where McManus said that you ca n't talk to people about what they do n't understand , which nicely and tragically summed up the plight of someone suffering from PTSD . If there had been more moments in the film like that , then it would have been more successful , because it 's one of the few times that the audience is allowed to empathize with a character . Better luck next time . " ,4
" Not that bad at all . What irked me the most about this film was the lack of attention to details , and what I consider an important one . The flags on the right shoulders of the uniforms were correctly worn backwards with the canton -LRB- field of stars -RRB- are in the top right corner instead of the left . Army regulations call for the flag to be worn so that to observers , it looks as if the flag is flying against a breeze . If a soldier was moving forward , the flag on the right shoulder would appear to be in motion . However if a flag is worn on the left shoulder , the canton should face left as it usually does . In this film some left shoulders had flags worn reverse , which is just wrong . I 've never had the honor of serving my country , but as an American I want our flag to be shown proper respect . " ,4
" Somebody shoot me too . I 've read prior comments concerning the character development , the musical score , and more good reasons to kill time with this movie . I heartily disagree . The music is good , but it 's sometimes overwhelming and unnecessarily hard . The characters , apart from the investigating sergeant , are cardboard characters , deprived of intelligence . I found it really hard to care about any of them , and I was continuously hoping that they would all end up in freakish accidents . Even the newbies deserved to get it up the rear end . I especially consider here the staff sergeant who goes AWOL . This guy is giving orders , and he 's a total basket case . If this is an accurate description of the American army , then by God , the world is in peril . The pace of the movie is slow , to say the least , the dialogues are simple -LRB- suitable for a redneck military audience -RRB- , and did I mention that the characters are despicable ? I suffered through the movie , and wish all the people who think this is good and realistic all the best . I fear a society where this is your standard drama , and I advise military leaders to also select their officers based on a psychological profile , and not only on the badass crazy percentage . " ,2
" The WORST Movie I have Ever Seen !!!! . This is by far the worst movie that I have ever seen . The DP must have been blind and the sound guy must have been wearing ear plugs . The film is a sad attempt at a low budget film . By the looks of it the film budget must have been $ 0 . The actors suck and the editing is ridiculous . Filmmakers in San Antonio , Texas are really stupid to think that audiences will want to see such a horrible film . I have yet to see a decent movie from a San Antonio Filmmaker . Someone needs to tell these people that their movies suck and that they need to stop making them NOW !!!! Just because you get your movie picked by a cheap distributor does not mean that the film is worse a damn !! I had to return the film an get my money back ... that 's how bad it was !!! " ,1
" Fantastic sound effects ! . Usually the sound effects are n't the first thing that I notice in a movie , but they are superbly done in this movie . The acting and direction are great too , but the sound effects keep you on the edge of your seat . The suspenseful tones and the Foley artwork blend nicely with the story , yet are not overly obtrusive and noticeable . I 'm not sure who did the sound effects on this movie , but I 'll certainly be looking for more movies from this team in the future . The lighting and cinematography were also well done and the story and character development were also easy to follow and intriguing . I 'm not sure why most people I know have n't seen this great movie yet . " ,10
" Rani Zindabad !!! . Aaja Nachle is Madhuri Dixit 's case for still being the best out there . And I 'm signed , sealed , and delivered . No one delivers the emotional expression through the entire spectrum the way she does . I just sat there in awe watching her . I guess my standards have slid a bit since she left . But she makes all the competition seem like runners-up to me . I can now say that I think the movie should sweep a lot of awards : It deserves Best Screenplay , Best Musical Director , Best Cinematography , Best Choreography , and Best Supporting Actor and Actress -LRB- Kunal and Konkona , of course -RRB- . If there was an award for a woman carrying the lead all by herself , there 's no question Madhuri Dixit would deserve it . There have only been a few -LRB- Nargis , Hema , Shabana -RRB- who 've been in that elite group . Madhuri belongs there too . There is SO much music and dance in this movie , it is hard to pick a favorite . But as soon as I saw the dancers in red with their hair flying , doing the song about Ishq during the Laila-Majnu play , I knew that I had seen this year 's favorite for me . I like them all , especially the traditional one for Aaja Nachle . But the staging , lighting and choreography for this Ishq dance were so DRAMATIC that it stands out . I loved the subplots , like the `` most boring man '' and his wife . The quarreling of Imran and Anokhi . The conflict between the Raja and Dia -LRB- Akshaye , a favorite of mine , really gave this movie a nice bit of electricity -RRB- . And , of course , when they told the story of Laila and Majnu as kids , with her feeling every pain he had and the world tearing them apart , my heart went awwwwwwwwwwwww -LRB- not mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this time -RRB- . Oh , did I mention Best Costume . Madhuri was dressed so nicely ! That last one when the play concluded was just gorgeous . I can see that this play would win the hearts of townspeople in a small village . Anyway , EVERYONE should see this movie . I did a 50 mile round trip and this time I do n't even regret it . Out of all the movies I 've seen this year , this one truly made driving worthwhile . 9 out of possible 10 " ,9
" Best film of the year -- sure to be a smashation ! . 2007 has been dry , but finally , we have been delivered . Aaja Nachle is full of elements Bollywood has been missing for some time and is in SORE NEED of . Namely : 1a -RRB- Dance numbers . That is to say , numbers focused on DANCING , rather than someone 's flashy Western outfit , locations , batman angles , etc. 1b -RRB- LOTS OF dance numbers . I 'm sick of scanty three-song phoned-in craptations . Aaja Nachle keeps the music coming all the time ! That 's the way it should be done . 2 -RRB- Classical infusion . The end of the film is a knockout surprise in this respect . I do n't want to spoil anything , but there is so much here for those who love the ancient stories as well as the new . 3 -RRB- Hot dudes . OH MY GOD , Kunal Kapoor ! 4 -RRB- MADHURI . Looking spectacular , so charming , totally in control of her performance and giving it her all . Her hips are the world 's 9th wonder . 5 -RRB- Great young leading ladies i.e. Konkona Sen Sharma . She is the best actress to have come out in the last couple of years and the girl is here to stay ! Sonam Kapoor ? pfft ! Katrina Kaif ? pfft squared ! The story is simple but busy , with dramatic moments that touch deeply and comedic moments that have the audience rollicking . There is n't a single minute that drags ; this film is not only well written and well acted , but well paced -LRB- a dear rarity in Bollywood -RRB- . In short , it is here to bring Bollywood back to where it belongs ! An unmitigated success from the inimitable Madhuri . I 'm going to see it again this week , then I 'm going to buy the DVD -- ORIGINAL ! Not that anyone needs to be reminded , but you must see this film ! " ,10
" Very entertaining ; Madhuri shines ! . Upon release , Anil Mehta 's Aaja Nachle , which was widely promoted as Madhuri Dixit 's comeback vehicle , failed miserably . I watched it now for the first time , and I enjoyed it thoroughly . It is such a nice film - colorful , musical , beautiful . This it the story of Diya , a trained dancer who , many years ago ran away from her town with an American man she fell in love with and moved to New York . Now Diya is a professional dancer-choreographer , and a divorc e with one kid . In spite of having promised to never return to India , she hurriedly flies back when learns that her trainer is on his deathbed . She is late , as he has already passed away , but he leaves a message for her as his last wish , to save an old theater named Ajanta -LRB- where she used to dance -RRB- from getting ruined and turned into a shopping mall . The story follows Diya 's firm decision and later efforts to revive the Ajanta theater in a town where she is widely infamous . Her plan is to set a new play named Laila Majnu . The problem is that people in the town dislike her , and only a good response to it can change the theater 's fate . Aaja Nachle is essentially a musical , nothing very serious , nothing to be taken seriously , and nothing that will provide you with new lessons in life . What it definitely does provide is entertainment , and there it scores . It is not a great movie , but it has a great sense of fun and it flows well . The song numbers are appropriately incorporated into the film , and in this one they are presented mostly as realistic situations in accordance with the story . The film has many subplots , many of which I think were effectively presented , particularly the one involving the character of Mohan Sharma , Diya 's past fianc e who was abandoned as she ran away . Several sequences are extremely funny . My favorite is when different girls , most of whom know nothing about dance , audition for Diya 's play . Director Anil Mehta is an accomplished cinematographer and he uses his skills to the max in his first directorial effort . Choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant , which is obviously very important , is very well done . The music directors duo Salim-Sulaiman compose a nice soundtrack without which the film would . Aaja Nachle rests on the able shoulders of the wonderful Madhuri Dixit , who is as charming , natural and charismatic as ever . Clearly , her absence from movies has dimmed absolutely nothing about her , neither her acting prowess nor her ever-so commanding screen presence . Dixit is according to me one of the most beautiful women in the world , and here , her youthful , juvenile beauty is replaced by a more mature and ripe look which is equally appealing . Her eyes speak volumes , her expressions and gestures remain refined and forceful , and her smile ... oh this gorgeous smile , it is as amazing and mesmerising as ever . Diya 's persona is actually the one that made Dixit the star she is , the star who at some point could give any hero or heroine a run for their money . She is a strong woman who reeks charisma and dares to live life on her terms . The film does n't give Dixit many opportunities , but she delivers . She is feisty yet gracious , fiery yet elegant , and she is always vivacious and graceful . And what can one say about her dance ? Nothing except it is astonishing . The supporting cast includes many great actors , most of whom are not given that much scope , some of whom getting really small parts , but all are good . Konkona Sen Sharma is awesome . She is simply hilarious as the aggressive , unrefined Anokhi who is madly in love and will do anything to get the man she wants , including dance like an idiot . Towards the end she looks very pretty and it is overall a very good performance . Kunal Kapoor as Imran Pathan is very fine in what can be termed as his own version of the angry young man . Nothing great , but despite playing an overly hostile and hot-tempered guy he 's quite a likable fellow . Ranvir Shorey steals the show in a small role that is surely the best-written of all , and he is excellent . Akshaye Khanna in an extended guest appearance is good as he is in most of his films . Divya Dutta is very good in a tiny role , Irrfan Khan is criminally wasted in the even tinier role of her husband . Vinay Pathak is wonderful as the boring husband . Sushmita Mukherjee is funny as his wife , while Raghubir Yadav and Jugal Hansraj provide good support . Among the songs , I really liked the title track which is catchy and Madhuri 's dance for it elevates it further . My favorite song , however , is the melodious Ishq Hua . The film 's best sequence is when the Laila Majnu play finally takes place . It is just beautiful , spectacular , and is clearly well-invested and wonderfully executed and performed . The ending is expectedly sugarcoated , but who cares ? It seems like some people just can not appreciate anything that is not dramatic . This film is generally a lighthearted musical , that 's how it 's treated - it is good Hindi film entertainment , and a time-pass movie , in the most positive sense of the word . Another complaint was that Madhuri got a rather bland role which did n't do justice to her talent . So , people had not seen her weeping copious tears for so long that they badly expected her to do it again ? Ca n't an actor be good when he 's playing a character with less tears and more smiles ? Actually , the film is more of a tribute to Dixit 's mastery of the art of dance , which was one of the main factors that made her so popular , and I say it 's worth a watch . " ,7
" Better Than The Critics Say . I 'm quite frankly bewildered and saddened by some of the negative reactions , both from movie goer 's and critics , with regards to Aaja Nachle . Many people expected , for the return of Madhuri Dixit to films , that Yash Raj would have created some huge spectacular epic full of pomp , color and costumes . But that simply is n't Madhuri 's style now . It was a script she approved because she felt it was most like her life now . And she chose well . Frankly , the movie is perfect for her . The dancing reflects all of Madhuri 's abilities as a dancer , from classical Indian styles to modern . She dances better than ever here . Is the script original ? Absolutely not , but critics of this movie have conveniently forgotten that most Hindi films do not have scripts that are particularly original . Aaja Nachle is simply a movie that every country in the world who produces films has made at one point or another . The `` underdog '' takes on the government\/the bad guy\/the evil ruler , overcomes a lot of obstacles , and wins the day -LRB- and usually the heart of the people or someone else -RRB- . The difference here is that Madhuri , the lead actor , does n't end up with a romance at the end -LRB- though we get the future possibility -RRB- . Madhuri , like Juhi Chawla and other Indian actresses who are over 40 and married , realize that they can no longer `` run around trees '' believably like their younger counterparts . So a role such as this is perfect for Madhuri . The problems\/flaws of this script should n't unfairly rest upon her shoulders . What people also forget is the wonderful ensemble cast this movie has . I throughly enjoyed their stories and personal relationships and problems : corrupt politicians , a best friend held back by her husband , a boring man who wants more spark in his love live , the angry young man who finally learns what love is , and the young woman who learns what depths love can take her to . It 's the solid characterization that this movie has that makes it engaging . Not elaborate costumes or big musical production numbers . That having been said , the musical numbers , particularly the play-within-the-movie run the gamut from being fun to beautiful to heart breaking . I was particularly struck by one song not on the soundtrack , `` Ishq Ishq '' . Madhuri 's dancing in this is both modern and reminiscent of a worshipful devotee . Breathtaking . Ignore the naysayers . Notice that most of the people here actually liked the film . Do n't expect some elaborate script or huge costumed melodrama like `` Devdas . '' It is what it is : a feel-good movie with a wonderful cast and the return of the Queen of Hindi cinema doing exactly what she does best . May this not be her last film . " ,8
" Loved It ! . The first thing my dad did when the credits were done rolling -LRB- do stay through the end of the credits because they do n't tie up a storyline until then -RRB- , was to pat me on the back and say thank you for pushing him to come see Aaja Nachle because he had n't seen such a good film in a long time . Not counting Omkara , this was probably the best film I 've seen this year . It was uplifting and beautifully done , especially the Laila-Majnu part , which I wanted to watch again . Madhuri -LRB- who I was too young to appreciate in her hey-day -RRB- was vivacious and elegant and seeing her dancing and her expressions were such a treat . She 's surrounded by the stalwarts of Hindi parallel cinema - Raghubir Yadav , Irrfan Khan , Konkona Sen Sharma , Ranvir Shorey , Vinay Pathak , etc , and I wo n't even bother saying anything about Akshaye Khanna because I 'm just too damn biased . The plot drew from stories that have been around since the beginning of cinema . It 's cute and inspiring and it appealled to me more than Chak De India because of the dance\/theatre aspect of it . I think Anil Mehta did a wonderful job . As I was leaving the theater , everyone kept saying how wonderful it was , and that oddly made me feel proud because I think this a truly non-conformist film and if it does well , which it should , it does completely on it 's own merit , not because of star-power -LRB- Madhuri excluded -RRB- , gimmicks , or because it 's part of some trend . So , do go see it ! " ,10
" Awesome Entertainer . I have to agree i went to see this film with my mum and we throughly enjoyed it . Everyone in the film has acted well and the Laila Majnu climax is one of the best adaptations that i 've seen . It 's truly a beautiful concept and a feast for the eyes . It felt as if i was in a theater enjoying a stage play . Madhuri has done well in this film , the role suits her perfectly but hats off to the other actors who have shown their talent in the climax . The songs are also pleasant and fit in perfectly with the pace of the film , not once do you feel that they are out of place . In my opinion this is much better than Om Shanti Om and should have been released for the festive season instead of OSO . Do n't miss this film in the cinema , ignore all the critics and go see it for yourself ! " ,10
" Boring bundle of melodrama blown beyond proportion ... . Talk about over use of melodrama . I can not understand how audience is expected to digest this pathetic excuse of a movie . Something like this is better left as a reality show or made for TV movie or for some saas\/bahu kind of soap opera . From the time Madhuri received the call and has the first meeting with Ahshaye , the rest of movie is entirely predictable . There is absolutely nothing in the movie that is worthy of mention apart from a couple of good scenes by Raghuvir Yadav and Irfaan Khan , which is why this gets 3 and not 1 out of 10 . Melodrama is not alien to Bollywood movies , but this was way too much . I mean at the end of it the goonda politician who would sell his soul for power and money is shown crying and business man who would bribe one and all has had a sudden change of heart ! Please !! Is this the best you can put out ?!! Also , too many musical numbers and none really catchy . I detest movies like these , they make me want to quit watching desi movies ... it is that bad . " ,3
" Classic Movie . One of the best movies of 2007 , finest songs from the best singers in the country and finest dance from the best dancers in the country . Story line is wonderful , and actors are brilliant , locations and direction are also remarkable . This movie gives a taste of Indian classical music and dance , has got a romantic angle to it . Love and culture being the main theme of the movie , it takes you to a fun filled ride into lives of people trying to save their heritage and building bonds with their loved ones . It has a positive energy all the time and sends a sweet message to its viewers , shower love and kindness and world will be a better place to live . " ,10
" Simply mindblowing . Aaja nachle in a single word is Outstanding . The movie breaks the conventional notion of bollywood pop-corn flicks and it is for sophisticated audience . This movie is not for people who watch and enjoy mediocre stuff . Madhuri Dixit is the heart and hero of this movie and she delivered an impeccable performance . She proves once again that she is the BEST ACTRESS India has ever seen and truly one of the greatest entertainers of all time ! Her expressions , emotions , timing , beauty , dance etc. are simply out of this world . OK , I can keep on going ... Music is awesome too , specially O Re Piya ... it is a wonderful track . All the supporting actors were OK ... nothing great ! Every moviegoer should watch this film just for the EMPRESS ... She is Back ! " ,10
" Madhuri magic - Still bewitching . Let 's first get the obvious out of the way This movie was conceptualized for those who lived and basked in the age of Queen Madhuri . If you have cherished memories of growing up with this charming , lovable lady with her bewitching grace and mesmerizing smile , run to your nearest God and ask for blessings for the crew of this movie that have brought you back your first love . This movie will make you fall in love with Madhuri all over again . This movie is meant to be an easy-watch . There is not much to be angry about or no one to be angry on . -LRB- the poor baddie is even mellow enough to break-down into tears in the end . -RRB- There is not much to work your gray cells about . Nothing makes you laugh-out-loud or shed a tear on . Rationale , attention-to-detail were never meant to be its forte , so do n't even care . Instead sit back and feast your eyes on the colors , the dance-sequences , the leisurely movie-making that does not strive to try too hard but plays itself out with a very enjoyable and likable pace . There is focus on the sublime aspects of life love , friendship , helping and sharing , coming together for a cause -LRB- The joy of doing something together as put by Madhuri in one scene -RRB- . And of course there is absolutely no way your heart will not go out to that damsel in distress , with daughter in tow and a m lange of rookies fighting the cruel cruel world to uphold Culture and the last wish of a dying Guru . Actors like Konkona , Raghuvir Yadav , Irrfan , Vinay Pathak , Ranvir Shorey , Yashpal Sharma never fail to delight and this movie is no exception . The music though not path breaking does blend with the mood of the movie and provides the required support . All in all , keep your expectations right and you will come out of this movie with a smile on your face a tune in hum . " ,7
" Brilliant movie \* spoiler alert \* . A movie dedicated to the arts . A movie spellbinding enough to woe any audience . A movie so beautiful it gets you speechless . Aaja Nachle , stars the dancing legend Madhuri Dixit , in a comeback role as Dia . Well , as we know her dancing skills are inevitably one of de best Hollywood has seen , to top it up her timeless beauty and on screen grace grabs the attention of any movie lovers . The movie resolves around a controversial topic Where Dia , an average Indian family daughter falls for a white guy and runs away from home due to parental and society objection .

Her hurt always the story moves on with diya recruiting fellow city folks on her play to be staged at the very place she learned to dance . Emotions are collided with manipulations as some try to sabotage her plans . How she over comes it and How she pulls off the play is the climax of the story . The movie emphasizes on musical aspects on portraying emotions and acting . Madhuri radiates her beat in glamour 's ways captivating the audiences mind and soul . Songs accompanying the movie transcends generations where classical and modern touches are combined . A must watch movie I would say . Unlike other movies , the story line is different and the movie is made with such perfection that it does n't give a single clich aura towards the audience . A must watch movie for its songs , dance sequence , beautiful choreography , beautiful people and definitely a well made top notch story line . Two thumbs up for madhuri and the entire crew of aaja nachle . Kudos ! " ,10
" Its hard to find such a film ... . Personally , it is one of the best films I have seen over a long time . It is commercial , but has a lot of meaning ... there is a message for many , right from lovers ... to politicians . As you must be knowing , making a film , means spending money , and all they look for is to derive back that money . As the saying goes , if one does good , good follows . And so most of the bollywood flicks turn out to be glamour and mimicries . But here is a bunch of people who require a grand appluase for their hard work , time and money . I am sure there are more who wish to do good , am sure , watching this film will inspire them . In this case too , am sure the film is going to succeed well . And I really hope they get the money back , so that more `` MEANING-FULL '' films come up . I am not commenting on the story , because I guess its already available , am here trying to just share the treasure . films like this can definitely make the world a better place ... Congrats !!! Thanks for reading this review and hope you do good . " ,10
" The Return Of Madhuri - She Is Back . Aaja Nachle is not a typical Yashraj film in the sense of scenery - snow , mountains , etc. . But one thing is for sure and that is that this is the return of Madhuri Dixit , whose last film was `` Devdas . '' Dia , a dance instructor , who lives in New York , receives a call that her tutor , who lives in the village of Shyamilee , in India , is very ill and has called for her . Upon her return , she is informed that he has passed away and that it was his wish that she tries to save the arts center in which she , herself , was once a student . She then finds her best friend , Najma , but she refuses to help her . Directed by Anil Mehta and written by Aditya Chopra , this is a musical genre movie and the songs are memorable , which makes it a change since nowadays , there are only some songs and music that can be hummed to or remembered . The most memorable is the title song itself and off course , with Madhuri Dixit looking so slim and gorgeous , the dances are worth while watching . The cast includes Akshaye Khanna , Konkona Sen , Kunal Kapoor , Vinay Pathak , Divya Dutta and Irfan Khan . Madhuri Dixit 's charm is still there and this movie , for all her fans , is worth watching - this is the return of Madhuri . Yes ! It is expected that she will work in movies but not so much as before , " ,10
" National Disaster . I watched the movie and as hyped as the comeback of madhuri dixit , this movie has turned out to be a waste of time and my money . Totally disappointed as there is nothing good in the movie . The story is as thin as a thread ; what I do not understand is how can anyone produce a movie with such bad script and screenplay . Very mediocre performances and cheap jokes . All the lead actors were like jokers . And it seemed that the lead actor in this movie was scratching an iron desk when she was talking ... One of the biggest comeback flop of Indian cinema . The movie did not do well anywhere in India . moreover the movie was banned in 3 or 4 nothern India stated because in the title song they spoke against low caste people of India . This was not expected ! " ,1
" Worth a watch ... . Just for Madhuri Dixit ! This is MD 's first movie role since Devdas -LRB- 2002 -RRB- and it is worth a watch just to see the India 's beauty on screen again . HOWEVER ... THE MOVIE 'S PLOT LINE SUCKED . It was beyond ridiculous and boring and unrealistic at best . Plus , Madhuri Dixit -LRB- now a mother of 2 boys -RRB- certainly did hold back in her acting , as she is known as being a bold , confidant type of female character . The songs are good , and the movie has a number of great actors such as Madhuri , Akshaye Khanna , Konkona Sen Sharma , Irrfan Khan , Kunal Kapoor and Divya Dutta . However , Madhuri if possible should return to films but accept small supporting roles as well -LRB- such as Rani Mukherjee 's character in Saawariya -RRB- because there wo n't be a great shooting load and she has aged and no longer can carry a film judging by Aaja Nachle 's failure . AGain , I do say watch the film if you want to see Madhuri again , the movie does solely get a 7\/10 for her presence -LRB- or else it would get a 2\/10 -RRB- or watch one of her other films instead such as HAHK , Devdas or even Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam . Also , there should have been more focus on her relationship with Akshaye Khanna than the `` theater play '' and politics . " ,7
" Fantastic . The movie is fantastic.An excellent comeback from Madhuri after 5 years.The story is brilliant.It opens when Dia a dance teacher works in USA with her family.One day she gets a call that her dance instructor is dead.And wants her to come back to Ajanta.She comes back.The old Ajanta is being converted to a shopping mall.Its now dia turn to save this.At the end she does a few dances which attracts peoples.She wins their hearts.An enjoyable family movie.Madhuri was superb.Divvya was superb.Konkana was superb.Kunal looked hot and was awesome.Irfan was superb.Akshaye was wonderful.Ranvir Vinay add humor and were funny.Direction is wonderful.Cinematography is excellent.Chereography is wonderful.The music is faboulous and superb.The lyrics are wonderful and so is the picturisations.A must see Rating-10 \/ 10 " ,10
" Utterly charming ! -LRB- Bahut bahut sundar ! -RRB- . This is a sweet , well-made , beautifully-photographed film . It has a good plot , a refreshingly modern script , and believable characters . Surprisingly wonderful performances are given by Madhuri -LRB- including her terrific dancing -RRB- , Kunal , Konkona , and Dalai -LRB- who plays her savvy young daughter -RRB- , as well as all the junior and minor players in this film . Akshaye Khanna has a smaller but pivotal role , initially as an antagonist who must be won over by Madhuri 's determination to do something meaningful for the village she grew up in . The music and dance numbers are very enjoyable , including the opening scenes with Madhuri teaching modern jazz style dance in a studio in the US . The highlight of the film is a spectacular ` stage play ' production number as the culmination of the lead character 's -LRB- Madhuri 's -RRB- efforts to save her village from unwanted `` progress . '' I 'll watch this memorable movie again several times , I 'm sure , and I would n't say that for a lot of films , either ! This movie is definitely worth seeing , if you love Bollywood like I do ! " ,10
" Madhuri 's come back got to be better than this . `` Aaja Nachle '' is the come back movie of heartthrob of 90s , Madhuri Dixit , the dancing diva the Dhak Dhak queen . . but sadly Aaja Nachle turns out to be a mediocre movie which is definitely below the mark . I am sure Madhuri Dixit deserves better than this . . The movie starts in NY where Dia -LRB- Madhuri -RRB- a successful aerobic instructor or dance teacher is informed about her dying Guru . She immediately flies to India to meet her teacher , who i mite add is clearly the most irritating character in the movie . On her way she recollects all the memories of her life in India , where she learned how to dance and LIVE . The flashback part is the hardest to bear . . Madhuri is clearly not a bubbly teenager anymore . . n its a torture to c a 40-something jumping around the city merrily . . her Guru addresses her as `` Chudail '' . . n thats wen u realize that not all dialogs in the movie r meaningless . . Coming back to the story , Dia elopes to NY with her Firang boyfriend Steve -LRB- how he falls in Love with this old woman is a mystery !! -RRB- when her parents forcefully try to marry her to Mohan -LRB- Ranvir -RRB- . She leaves behind a hostile town , few broken hearts and a close friend . Once in NY she realizes that it was a bad decision . Now after all these yrs . . She is coming back to Shamli . She reaches India but by the time she is here her Guruji is already dead -LRB- thankfully !! -RRB- but master ji manages to torture by means of a video he leaves behind where he tells her that Ajanta the theater faces demolition because MP -LRB- Akshay Khanna -RRB- wants to build a SHAPPIN MAAL there . Dia decides to revive Ajanta by doing a show with the people of Shamli within 2 months and hence save it . I love underdogs movies , its a genre which forms its foundation on hope , aspirations , motivation and courage . Sadly Aaja Nachle fails to embark these emotions . As told by Guruji '' Jo Dil Se Nikalta Hai who Kala -LRB- art -RRB- Hota Hai Jodil Mein Reh Jata Hai Who Kaala -LRB- Black -RRB- Hota Hai '' . Aaja Nachle also fails to inspire , it fails to indulge you into the lives of the characters . The journey for Dia that seems so difficult in the beginning turns out to be a cake walk . She hardly struggles to achieve the success . '' Naach Gana Nahin Nritya Sangeet Choudhari Sahib '' is enough to convince the rowdy politician Choudhary Sahab -LRB- Akhilender Mishra -RRB- . `` Aapke Jaise modern Jamaane Ke foreign educated MP Se '' convinces Akshay Khanna . The whole town which hates Dia is pouring in for auditions . Madhuri Dixit gets tons of extras , huge sets , costumes Funds to do all that and there is not even one single scene which shows her intense struggle or tries to explain how . Definitely these things can be left as cinematic liberty but a few explanations would have made the story more believable . One thing which will impress anybody is the star cast of the movie . Ranvir Shourie as the tea stall owner Mohan who is madly in love with dia clearly stands out in terms of performance . This guy speaks from his eyes and when he says `` Chai bhi aapki main bhi aapka he moves the screen ; Vinay pathak looks cute and definitely acts well . Kunal Kapur , Irfan khan divya dutta Konkana Sen , : looks like the Director spent all his time on casting . . But the problem lies with the script which hardly leaves any scope for brilliance by any of these actors . Irfan Khan is wasted , Divya dutta has just one good scene and she does a great job . Dia tries to convince Shamli 's junta to support her in her struggle to save ajanta by saying `` Jab Tak Suraj Chaand Rahega Shamli Mein Ajanta Ka Naam rahega '' . Clearly Shamli is not convinced and definitely not you ... After the dialogs i have quoted so far it would n't require lot of brains to gauge another sad fact . . the dialogs of the movie are uninspiring to say the least . . Another shortcoming is the music , you expect mind blowing music the kind of music which will make you jump off your seat and shake a bit . But Aaja Nachle 's music is anything but great . It 's an average soundtrack with few moments of thrust . Another shortcoming is Vaibhavi merchant . This movie was offered on a platter to her . . she could n't have asked for more than Madhuri . . I was wondering if this was the same woman who gave us Kajra re . After a horrible performance in Saawariya Miss Merchant again fails to impress . I know its not that bad a job but for a movie like this you expect choreography which is out of this world . The last 20 minutes of the movie in which the play is shown , clearly stand out but with stupid moments like `` Na Maaro Chot Lagti Hai Na Maaro , Chunmun Si Hatheliyan Hai POOCHKAARO '' It leaves you with mixed emotions . Anil Mehta never tries to go into details . He did n't explore any single character he fails to put forward the emotions of any character and how the transformation is taking place . IF only he would have tried to put the characters of lives on the celluloid the end result would have been different . Yash raj has given us great movies but something is missing now . Chak DE is the only movie coming out of this production house which comes out as a winner . `` Tara Ra Rum Pum , Jhoom Barabar , Laga Chunari Mein Daag and Aaja Nachle also fails to live up to the expectation . " ,4
" Not groundbreaking ... But its a good movie . I do n't think Aaja Nachle was meant to be a groundbreaking movie with the coolest screenplay . On a whole its even somewhat uninspired and not entirely original but its a good movie nonetheless . In the context of Bollywood however , it 's actually is pretty original . Which was the last big-scale female-fronted Bollywood movie there was ? Frankly , I ca n't think of anything in the past two decades . Nothing from of the large scale , Yash Raj fame . To the critics who think this movie was n't even worth a watch , I think you 've got the point wrong . Well sure it is a bit too polished - a bit too commercial and `` safe '' but what choice do the producers have ? I do n't think the Indian film industry is ready for something more experimental and adventurous . There had to be some trade off . Even then , some of that commercialised coat melted with Madhuri 's charm . Yes , I think Madhuri played her `` magic '' well in this movie . She sunk her teeth into the role and exuberanted her charm so well , I think she alone added a lot more color to the movie . She almost overshadows the second and third lead in the film - Konkona Sen and Kunal Kamar . Both of them played their roles well and did a commendable job at that . To sum it up , I think most critics of this movie expected too much from the comeback of the lady who 's been hailed as Bollywood 's greatest actress . As it is , she shone brightly in a movie that 's decent . Its storyline may be somewhat predictable from the onset but its still an untapped genre in Bollywood . I 'd say , sit back , relax , do n't think too much and watch it for what its worth . I 'd give it 7.5 \/ 10 " ,10
" A different form of story telling . When I first saw the promos , I thought it will be a desperate attempt of a veteran -LRB- Madhuri Dixit -RRB- to make it back . But , I just wanted to see if Madhuri Dixit has lost the grace and charm after the break . And I am really glad to say that she 's still easily the best of actresses Indian Film has seen . The plot is not new -LRB- Swades , Lagan and so on have the same type of plot -RRB- , but the way story was told was really good . There were times when they dragged the scenes a bit long . But only to emphasize on different emotions . In the End , the Laila-Majnu play was just amazing . The sets and the costumes were really good . We have to give credit to that . Although the music was not so great but was good enough to keep the audience in theater . Kon Kona Sen Sharma was amazing . If you have to take names , then the list would not end . Everyone did their best for a movie that dared to showcase art . Two thumbs up ! BOTTOM LINE : Its a bold attempt to show the art as it should be and not attempting to appeal to the new generation . That is the best thing I loved in this movie . " ,7
" An ecstatic musical all the way . My categorized comment about the whole movie is like this Acting : 3.0 \/ 4 Direction : 0.5 \/ 1 Screenplay : 0.7 \/ 1 Cinematography : 0.9 \/ 1 Sound : 0.8 \/ 1 Music , Dance n Song : 2.0 \/ 2 in all 7.9 \/ 10 All in all it is a very good musical movie , actually its songs are very good and also the choreography is exceptionally good . Salim , Sulaiman should be given the credit for the wonderful music . Also , one particular thing about the movie is its song is shown in parts that gives a kinda different touch to the movie . At last the play portrayed at the end of the movie is wisely knitted . Must watch for a music lover , for choreography and ya for Madhuri fans . " ,8
" Madhuri is just pure MAGIC !!! . Madhuri Dixit 's comeback movie , though bit loose in script and the story-line , sums up the importance of arts in our life beautifully . Aaja Nachle brings to surface how the business of expressing oneself -LRB- read performing arts -RRB- is an integral part of life . Aaja Nachle has captured commendably well in the movie , the idea that everyone has an intrinsic desire to have that ` one moment of glory ' , the idea that everyone can ` show us some jalwa or the other ' , that dance , theater , music programs and such socio-artistic activities are essential to keep a society in tune with its innate desires to express , relate and emote to situations , that art forms can elevate a bored society stuck in the mundane business of life to new energy levels from time to time , and most importantly , the state has a role to ensure that the citizens have enough modes and means to avail entertainment at low costs . " ,7
" Madhuri Magic !! . `` The first opening shot sets the tone of the movie its about dance , music , art and also it is about happiness , love , culture , goodness in human beings . If you apply the first 15 min formula -LRB- word courtesy my friend , raj -RRB- , you know that this movie rocks ! It grips you from the first scene till the last scene . The story starts in flashback which madhuri tells to her daughter ... '' `` All the actors and actresses in the movie are perfectly cast . Everyone does their job best . To mention the few are Kunal Kapoor as Imraan who acts as Majnoo in dia 's show . Shushmita Mukherjee , as Mrs Chojar is good . Mr. Chojar , a boring government offices played by Vinay Kapoor is hilarious . His friend , Ranbir shorey , plays mohan , the hotel owner . He is silent lover of madhuri . Her real life majnoo -LRB- in the film -RRB- . Also the child artist who plays the role of dia 's daughter is also good . The most standout performance is by Akshaye Khanna as a young generation MP . He acts the role with elan and style . He brightens up the screen every time he is there . His character is most contemporary political character we have ever seen in bollywood movies . Both the role and the actors deserves applause ... '' " ,8
" Aaja Nachle , an Excellet Movie ... a MUST watch . . Madhuri Dixit has done it again . She mesmerizes with her powerhouse performance , dancing and on-screen presence . The story is absolutely unique and well paced . It keeps one glued to the screen . Dances have been choreographed excellently living up to the reputation of Madhuri 's dancing . The musical climax scene leaves you spellbound is an absolute joy to watch . A completely clean and entertaining movie . Go watch it and enjoy . Me and my family loved this movie . All the supporting actors have also performed very well . There are no unnecessary songs and action in the movie . Full credit to Madhuri to have maintained her so well even after having 2 kids . KUDOS to AAJA NACHLE . 10\/10 . " ,10
" Amazing colorful musical ! . This movie a musical about this girl from a village -LRB- in India -RRB- , who 's a dancer , falls in love with an American guy , leaves her family to go live in the states . Later we find out that the guy left her with a kid and that she 's making do as a dance instructor . 11 years later she comes back to the village because her dance instructor is dying and wants her to save the local theater , which is going to be demolished and a mall built in its place . To save it , she then makes a bet with the local Minister of Parliament that if she can put on a musical show -LRB- Romeo and juliet -RRB- , and the people like it , the theater stays . Well anyways , this movie is awesome because it 's not over the top emotional , its very light - hearted and the music and the performances are TOP-NOTCH . I had a bit of an issue with the chemistry between the `` laila '' and `` majnu '' , mainly that they did n't have much , but whatever it did n't detract too much from my enjoyment . 10\/10 , ENJOY ! " ,10
" excellent comeback . originally , i had high hopes for this movie . obviously , it IS madhuri dixit , who wud n't want to see her ? and welll ... it was a fantastic movie , as i expected . the songs were very well done and the dancing was . . spectacular . I 'm not such a great fan of Hindi movies mainly because their story lines are so repetitive and speak of love , which is great , but this movie IS a hit for sure . dixit has come back with great style ... one wud expect otherwise because of the years spent abroad and the difference in culture , also influencing a person over time . she apparently is still Indian , and I 'm glad :-RRB- i 'd give this movie a ten out of ten , because the acting is great and also the dance . . I 'm intrigued by their dancing and ca n't wait till i get to see more of her future up-comings . this movie is so so good , that i just HAD to comment and make a login account on IMDb . it 's THAT great . if ur a fan of dancing and madhuri , you should watch it . :-RRB- " ,10
" Performance of a heroine ... . This is more than Bollywood . Madhuri Dixit is versatile as Hema Malini , Aishwarya Rai , Rekha Sridevi . Just like in Devdas , she has performed excellent as expected in this movie after a period of R R. The music , choreography actors were excellent . The young love in the acting performance was excellent ... Laila-Magnu . The young actors playing those characters real love was romantic in the Bollywood way as in Romeo-Juliet way . The director showed that even when a man is `` jilted at the alter '' , he can forgive his love even after 11 years apart . The weakest directing is that Akshaye Khanna could have been more romantically challenging . His role was very short . In the ending , it was n't solid but dull . With the end though , it was nice to see everyone happy but making the whole villagers look gay -LRB- happy -RRB- is so unrealistic . A grumpy old man or woman should have added some real comedy . The evil man turned out not to be a strong villain . But then this movie tells you more about the society how they think or will say . The directer showed the real dilemma of a young girl 's love for her life happiness , her best friend 's obedience to her own husband , the villager 's harsh branding words insults , and a middle-aged couple whose marriage was getting boring . These are real life reflections in every country . This director showed it all in one film Madhuri Dixit acting showed that although it looked like a defeat , you need to try your best , get up your courage face your demons whether it be 10 years ago or 5 years ago . This is not a documentary , but read between the lines and see what the message is . Some songs were not so interesting but the best of all is the finale dance Ishq . Madhuri Dixit put the flexibility in her dancing that makes you wish you could dance like that . " ,9

" does not meet the expectations ... . A ` comeback ' film always holds significance . Amitabh Bachchan 's Mrityudatta Vinod Khanna 's Insaaf Dimple Kapadia 's Saagar Mumtaz ` as Aandhiyaan and Kajol ` Fanna are names you can not erase from your memory since the celebrated actors returned to the big screen after a hiatus . With Aaja Nachle , Madhuri Dixit , who reigned supreme , is back to the studios with the Numero Uno production house of the country . Does the actress still possess the charisma to ignite fire in water ? Also , does the vehicle she chooses to make a comeback with , have the fuel to reach the winning post ? Sadly , Aaja Nachle is below the mediocre mark and does n't meet the humongous expectations that you associate with the Yashraj - Madhuri combo . What 's the problem ? Without a doubt , the script ! What starts off as a story that seems real and identifiable becomes a fairy tale in the latter hour . Also , with a title like Aaja Nachle and the story harping on music , the songs had to be chart busters . That 's just not the case here ! In short , Aaja Nachle fails in the two vital departments -- writing and music . Bearing a striking similarity to the Brazilian film XUXA REQUEBRA , Jaideep Sahni 's screenplay is the biggest culprit here . The protagonist Madhuri knows that there would be hurdles galore on her way , as she embarks on a journey to realize her guru 's dreams . But she hardly struggles to achieve the impossible . Even the corrupt politician Akhilendra Mishra or the shrewd businessman Irrfan , who could 've proved to be tough nuts to crack , give in so easily . Besides , the goings-on get too unbelievable . The first question that crosses your mind is , how does Madhuri raise the funds to put up this spectacular event the set design in the penultimate song is marvelous ? Okay , that 's a cinematic liberty , but , seriously , there should have been at least some reference to where the money would flow in to fund this mammoth , lavish and extravagant event . What starts off as a ` real ' film , drifts into a ` surreal ' world as it moves ahead . Debutante director Anil Mehta knows the importance of frames\/visuals since he 's an accomplished cinematographer . But Mehta ought to know by now that it 's the content that does the talking eventually . The writing is too commonplace to make any impact whatsoever . In an effort to strike a balance between believable and make-believe , Aaja Nachle falls like a pack of cards . Salim-Sulaiman 's music is another minus point . You expect the songs to linger in your memory even after the show has ended that 's what makes a musical tick , right ? It 's not the case here . Dialogues are wonderful at places , especially the ones delivered by Akshaye Khanna and Madhuri . Cinematography Mohanan is splendid . Madhuri has always delivered qualitative performances and the fire continues to burn to this date . She 's top notch , but how one wishes the script would 've done justice to her talent . It does n't offer her a pedestal to take that big leap . The loyal Madhuri fans would surely feel disillusioned and saddened . Akshaye Khanna is tremendous . In fact , it 's a treat to watch Madhuri and Akshaye together , after a hiatus . Kunal Kapoor is likable ; he enacts his part with natural ease . Konkona is nice , but when compared to her previous work , it 's definitely not in that league . Irrfan , in a brief role , is okay . Divya Dutta too is relegated to the backseat . Ranvir Shorey is first-rate . Ditto for Raghuvir Yadav . Darshan Zariwala does a fine job . Yashpal Sharma is alright . Vinay Pathak and Sushmita Mukherjee are adequate . Akhilendra Mishra is as usual . Jugal Hansraj gets no scope . Vinod Nagpal and Uttara Baokar , as Madhuri 's parents , have nothing much to do . Felix D'Alviella as Steve -- Madhuri 's lover is passable . On the whole , Aaja Nachle disappoints big time . At the box-office , the film has embarked on a poor start and coupled with weak merits will only emerge as one of the major disappointments of the year . " ,2
" Madhuri - Spectacular Method acting . . Bad Sreenplay , yes , which is a reality of this movie . Average Music , shoddy narration , and direction that just about suffices the need for the film to progress . But Madhuri Dixit , the lead actress , is outstanding . She in every sense has given the best performance of the year as Dia . She is not even for a moment out of character and manages to catch and deliver all the crafty nuances of the character with truckloads of grace and beauty . This is true method acting . All the other actors were good too , especially Konkana SenSharma and Ranvir Shorey . But Madhuri carries this film completely . Very few actresses in Indian cinema have this much of screen presence that not even once you miss a lead actor in the movie , that is the old story behind a time-tested formula . Watch this movie entirely for Madhuri Dixit . The choreography was average and comes as a rude shock . Overall the movie does fail Madhuri , and the Chopras can be hanged for it . But the magic is still on . Madhuri Dixit is spectacular in the movie . Believe me for I have seen some top-class acting in the world , Madhuri as Dia deserves the Silver Lotus Award . " ,7
" Aaja Nachle Se Bhaag Le . Why does it happen in Bollywood ? If a person is successful , what is the surety that his kid will be the same ? Exceptions , like Hrithik Roshan , do exist but in most cases , the kids are awful . Here , I am talking of Aditya Chopra . He 's burying his father 's hard-earned name with a series of senseless movies which is bringing Yash Raj Films to an all-time low . They have already started cutting down on movie promotions . Except for Chak de , all YRF movies this year - Tara Rum Pum , Jhoom and Lagaa chuneri have bombed . We say - once bitten , twice shy . But even thrice shy is not working . Now , Junior Chopra comes with another Dumbo - Aaja Nachle . As far as Madhuri is concerned , the dhak-dhak lady has not lost it . She still looks charming and can dance unbelievably well . And as a mother of 10 year old , she looks great in the role . The problem is script , direction , music and the wrong selection of cast . The script is predictable , boring and spontaneous . By spontaneous , i mean that whenever some event happens in the movie , it is solved in the next 5 minutes . Also , the play in the end was below average . I could hear some emotions and applause in theater during the play but that was only from the audience in the movie itself . Moreover , the overall story is not strong . And if you add an average direction to a predictable storyline , the end result is definitely gon na be boring . Another problem is music which is just OK . For a movie revolving around dance , you need to have a breathtaking music but there is hardly anything there in that department . The songs are equally boring . When we talk about good actors not being given enough opportunities , we mean give them movies which lazy star-kids are ruining . If you want Konkana Sen Sharma and Kunal Kapoor to form a Dancing Couple , you have gone nuts . They are best suited for demanding roles which involve strong character . As for other actors , they do n't get much of screen presence . But , i did like the little girl who portrayed Madhuri 's Daughter . Looked an original NRI kid . Anyways , watch this movie on a boring weekend if you have nothing much to do or wait for it to come on the idiot box . Just to cheer you up , it is better than the torturous Jhoom Barabar Jhoom .

" Got my vote at the IUSB IVFF . I loved this film . I attended the Indiana University of South Bend Independent Video and Film Festival and was so impressed with this film that was created by a couple of great guys -LRB- had the chance to speak with them a bit - very genuine -RRB- . The movie was so funny and entertaining . I already had it in my mind who I was going to vote for for the audience choice award but then I watched this film and changed my vote . Watch it if you can ! There were some laugh out loud funny moments . Many actually . The acting was done in such a way that it did n't really seem like they were acting . Some of the dialogue and banter back and forth is just `` spot on '' with some relationship drama that I have experienced . " ,8
" Perfect antidote to cheesy Hollywood rom-coms . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is like the independent antidote to the sickening Hollywood rom-com . This is a funny and intelligent look at the dysfunctional relationship between two real people , no sugar coating , no bull and lots of laughs . We open with a dishevelled Dan as he lies rotting on the couch , drinking beer , wallowing in bitterness and scratching the days since his break up with Lisa off his calendar . Dan and Lisa were in a relationship , in fact they had just gotten engaged when Dan came home from work one night and caught Lisa in bed with another woman . He left her and we pick up the story a while later when Dan decides to go back and confront her . The film plays out in a series of recorded interviews , documentary style , with both characters and then the main thread of action which focuses on Dan 's return to their home and the resulting conversation which quickly descends into an emotional argument . Dan and Lisa are the only two characters in the film but there is easily enough going on between them to hold your interest . The documentary style blurs into the action and is surprisingly effective mainly because the script is really sharp and witty . The film was made by the Butler Brothers , Brett and Jason , and Brett stars as Dan . These guys are genuine independent film makers with very little in the way of budget and other than the music they seem to have done the whole thing themselves . I 'd highly recommend this , it made me laugh out loud more than once . " ,9
" Confusions of an Unmarried Couple Review . As a guy who has been in a committed relationship for about two years now , I find myself , like many people out there I am sure , seeking out films and articles or even songs that I can relate to with my own little struggles . The good times , the hard times , the lovey-dovey times . Confusions of An Unmarried Couple displays a pair of people about as far away from my personal relationship as possible - but it is one of those films where you do n't have to be either character 100 % ; you just have to see enough of yourself in them , or in your partner , or in your friends to really understand and feel where the film is coming from . It is an abrupt , to the point , no-nonsense take on one couple and their dealing with an awkward situation where one member was caught cheating on the other . As you can imagine , intense drama is to follow and it most certainly does ; but not without hints of comedy here and there . Actually , there are a bit more than just hints scattered throughout . Confusions is actually borderline hilarious . Two people who spend the entire film trying to figure the other person out , their motives and why they did what they did does n't sound like a laugh riot - but the Butler brothers , the duo responsible for the film , balance it out and deliver one hell of an offbeat comedy . Delivering a film with flashes of Wes Anderson , Woody Allen and even Richard Linklater ; showing once again that a film can be about the simple drama between two people and still carry as much life to it as any film with a vast cast of characters . The thing that surprises though is how the film does n't take itself serious , and yet gives us characters who very much do - and throws them together to combat one another for basically the audience 's amusement . I love you , I hate you and I 'm going to yell at you until I love you . I would n't go about calling Confusions a `` quaint '' film , but there 's something very likable about it and even likable about these characters who ultimately have done horrible things to one another for reasons they are n't even very sure of . Who still , even after months apart , find themselves battling each other simply because they ca n't let one another go . I am a big fan of high drama split between a small cast of characters , and have always been interested in cinema that felt like it could be taking place right up on a stage in any theater in the world - and that drew me into Confusions of an Unmarried Couple from the start , even when just reading up on it . I have always loved films like The Odd Couple or The Apartment , where the characters were the main focus of the film and the performances were the most important feature . Confusions takes up this cause , and delivers a film that would probably make a spectacular stage play - but one would have to change out all the little intricacies that make this such a `` movie '' . The actually story based segments of the film , where we watch our young couple battle back and forth , is juxtaposed between videotapes of themselves giving interview confusions of just why the relationship failed and why what happened did indeed happen . It is n't explained who is giving the interviews , who is behind the camera or for what reasons ; but that is n't really the important part . This is the way the filmmakers truly let us into the world of these characters and our way of better understanding them . Being that the two of them are so confused about one another , and people plan things a lot better than they actually are able to say them aloud - we the audience are left to decipher just what is what in this complex and crazy world of relationships gone sour . Overall , I found myself a big fan of the film and I think the Butler brothers have the opportunity to become either very large and respected figureheads in the independent community or important filmmakers who lay on the outskirts of independence and the Hollywood community . Much like Linklater , Anderson or the Coens . That seems all up to them , as with original ideas and presentation are in short supply in this day and age - and I see great things coming from these guys . I personally ca n't wait to see more from them . " ,8
" a great mix of funny , profound and risqu moments . Canadian filmmakers Brett and Jason Butler are obsessed with sex . In their film Bums , they chronicled the single guy 's Saturday night search for a hook-up . In Confusions of an Unmarried Couple , they take a look at the sexual issues of Dan and Lisa 's relationship : the excitement in the beginning , the boredom as time goes by , adultery , lesbianism , breaking up , making up , loneliness and the pre-planning needed to successfully participate in a threesome . Dan and Lisa have broken up because of Lisa 's adultery with another woman . After weeks of depression spent sleeping on a friend 's sofa consuming too many beers -LRB- and not bathing or shaving nearly enough -RRB- , Dan decides to go back to Lisa 's place to reclaim some of his possessions and hopefully a bit of his dignity . This leads to a sometimes-hilarious , sometimes-profound afternoon of their yelling at each other , revisiting old wounds and creating new ones . Interspersed throughout this present-day afternoon fight is confessional video footage of Dan and Lisa shot over the past few weeks since the breakup , where they 've each revealed far more to the camera than they ever did to each other . The Butlers ' creative use of `` chapter breaks '' that show past photos of the happy couple and highlight the issues that the couple struggle with -LRB- tact , fidelity , maturity -RRB- is a unique way to break up the film . These breaks , coupled with the videotaped confessional flashbacks , give the film a whimsical non-linear quality that avoids the potential overkill of watching a couple fight for an hour . Actors Brett Butler -LRB- Dan -RRB- -LRB- who also wrote and co-directed the film -RRB- and Naomi Johnson -LRB- Lisa -RRB- portray this couple realistically and passionately without going over the top . This is not your run-of-the-mill indie comedy-drama , by any means . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is a unique mix : an engaging relationship drama combined with a risqu sexual comedy , sprinkled with deeply profound observations about sex and dating . In addition to the obsession with sex , this film contains all of the other items I consider to be standard in any Butlers brothers ' film : solid writing , creative directing and a great soundtrack . Plus , there 's a small homage to John Hughes and an unusual ending . This film is like my favorite candy : a little sweet , a little tart , just the right size , leaves no bad aftertaste , and I want to share it with my friends . " ,9
" ` Confusions ' Clearly a Winner . The latest Butler Bros. . Brew , Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is a treat likened to finding the last brewsky in the ice chest , or enough roaches in the ashtray to make one last doob . A woman who does n't know what she wants , a man who knows what he wants but ca n't have it , two ingenious brothers from Toronto who know exactly what they want , what we want , and how to pass it to us without a bogey . Brett and Jason lead us into a searing and hysterical foray through the functions of a dysfunctional couple who are on the precipice of either marriage or disaster -LRB- is there a difference ? -RRB- , blending a unique twist on breaking up into a mash of self-discovery and self-absorbency . Lisa and Dan were a happy couple experiencing the life of love and laughter until Dan proposed . Lisa was so happy that she had to share the news with her old friend Jill who just happened to call . As often does , excitement of the heart led to excitement of the body and Jill happened to be available . Dan came home to what could have been a manly fantasy , but disturbed him beyond reason . Several months of video rehab with his brother , a few pranks and a lot of beer later , Dan confronts Lisa , and the match is on . The interaction of the couple is reflective of the post breakup meet ups of scores of people through the years , the dysfunction undeniably real . Dan 's brother provides `` documentary '' evidence of the meeting along with flashbacks and running commentary by each party . Working without a Hollywood budget means working because you love the work . That sensibility is evident in each Butler Brew , and ` Confusions of an Unmarried Couple ' is no exception . Yes , there is profanity . Deal with it . The reality of relationships is that emotions get going and grammar is gone . The reality on steroids is what makes the film such a fun jaunt . Dan -LRB- Brett Butler -RRB- , torn between his love for Lisa -LRB- Naomi Johnson -RRB- and his moral stance that cheating is cheating despite male fantasy , is portrayed believably and with true emotion ; the keyword here being believably . Sure we could have had Vince Vaughn do the dialogue in a typical west coast format , but then we would lose the essence and have an entirely different movie . I have heard the arguments that `` this is a story about messed up relationships is old territory covered many , many times '' , and I have to ask myself the question , `` Is there anything TRULY new coming out of Hollywood ? '' No . Formulas work and have for 90 years . Again , deal with it . For anyone seeking a good laugh at a painful subject which nearly all of us have experienced at one time or another , ` Confusions ' is a smart , witty ride that will leave you grateful that the indie is n't dead . Pass me a cold one , and kill the lights . " ,8
" Bloody Brilliant Butlers . The Butler Brothers have once again produced a very well-made and highly enjoyable film . Having seen their first two films -LRB- Alive and Lubricated , and Bums -RRB- I was eager to get my hands on Confusions of an Unmarried Couple , and it certainly met the high expectations I 've set for these talented filmmakers . Confusions is a very entertaining , very smart and undoubtedly very funny film . The dialogue between Dan -LRB- Brett Butler -RRB- and Lisa -LRB- Naomi Johnson -RRB- is incredibly well written and executed . The process of learning both sides of their story contributes to the development of an engaging , and amusing story , which oftentimes switches from very poignant moments to downright hilarious moments . I purchased this film in Toronto , and have since brought it out West to Vancouver , where I know I 'm doing a great service to my friends by introducing them to the genius works of the Butler Brothers . Unsurprisingly , everyone has loved this film so far ! One of my favorites ! " ,10
" An all around great flick . The writing in every one of the Butler Bros. movies is something that you would hear in real life conversations . Saw this movie at the Indie Can film festival here and loved it . Pulling no punches with the language and the situations put onto the screen are things that make this movie a genuine winner . Tons of comedy peppered with great acting and directing , make this something to be watched and talked about . Even though everyone has had a relationship that had gone south for sometimes no apparent reason at all , this one was obvious and funny as hell , and the way that Dan and Lisa deal with it all is great . Another great flick from the Butler Brothers . " ,10
" Poignant and disarming relationship comedy . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is a poignant relationship comedy that sees the Butler Brothers further developing their own unique voice . Self-deprecating slob Dan -LRB- Brett Butler -RRB- leaves his girlfriend Lisa -LRB- Naomi Johnson -RRB- after he catches her in bed with another woman just days after she accepts his marriage proposal . His clumsy attempts at reconciliation - interspersed with the couple 's revealing video diaries - are more subtle than the sometimes sophomoric Kevin Smith-styled antics of their earlier film , ultimately revealing Confusions as a more emotionally sophisticated film . But Confusions still manages to maintain a raw edge through the Brothers ' use of clever , sexually frank dialogue . Technically , it 's an improvement over their earlier efforts as well , with tighter editing , considered cinematography , and more believable acting . Equal parts Woody Allen and the Hanson Brothers , Dan 's private thoughts and self-delusions provide most of the film 's spot-on humor , and though the results are n't laugh-out-loud funny , Confusions is still a cut above most indie relationship comedies , and deserves to be seen by a wide audience . " ,8
" One Step Closer to an Indie Masterpiece . The Butler Bros. continue to amaze me . As filmmakers , they have a mental library of great directors they draw upon to make their own works . More importantly , I never feel that they are unworthy of the significant comparisons . Take the Bros. newest film Confusions of an Unmarried Couple , for example . The influences of John Cassavetes are unmistakable . It 's easily the strongest film to date from two of the strongest voices in indie film . But that also means it 's time for them to step it up to the next level of film-making . Confusions follows Dan , who months after finding his girlfriend Lisa in bed with another girl decides to collect his belongings from the apartment they shared . Apparently looking for a confrontation , Dan makes sure that Lisa is home before he barges in . An argument , months in the making , it lives up to everything a knock-down , drag out relationship fight should be , right down the sex part . Confusions is the Butler Bros. most inspired and most flawed achievement . It 's inspired because the Brothers take their usual topic -LRB- a break-up -RRB- and turn it into a fresh cin ma v rit relationship film . The life and intimacy in the production that differentiates the Brothers ' work from the films that inspire them . But the Brothers have outgrown the style that made them famous . In an interview with co-director Brett Butler , Brett said that he and his brother Jason have matured , but their characters have n't . It 's apparent on screen . The story does n't need the Butlers ' signature humor , which is rooted in debates groups of friends , not two lovers , would have . Some of the lines just fall flat . In spite of that , the film holds together . Maybe it 's the aggressive intimacy that makes the film work . The Brothers are able to dig up conscious and subconscious insecurities in their characters . The devastating honesty in the interviews with Lisa and Dan -LRB- made into a documentary by Dan 's fictional brother -RRB- goes beyond the pop culture references to Sixteen Candles or Angelina Jolie . I would hate to pull another Kevin Smith comparison out for the Butler Bros. , but I will only as a warning . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple , through all of its inspiration and artistry , could end up being the Butlers ' Chasing Amy if they do n't proceed cautiously from here . Sure , they do n't have Ben Affleck , but Confusions is the type of soul-searching project that can make or break a filmmaker . Before he made Clerks 2 , Smith 's films had an empty quality to them based in his inability to leave something behind . When he made Clerks 2 , he was n't just revisiting ; he was growing . The Butler Bros. are on the verge . They 've already proved they are ready to grow beyond their first two productions with the refreshing addition of Ryan Noel as sound and music guy . All I 'm asking now is for the Brothers to move past what they are doing and finally make that indie masterpiece that I know they have in them . " ,9
" Well Worth Watching . The characters are believable . The situation is believable . The acting was n't Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall but what the acting lacked in skill , it more than made up for in raw presence . There were long exchanges between the two and in the final cut both actors did a fantastic job of delivering their often pornographic jibes and counterpoints with an expertise that seemed to come more from hunger than experience and I often find this sacrifice refreshing in an Indie film . There were several points when I laughed out loud for minutes at some of Dan 's statements . Lisa seemed to be playing catch up throughout most of the movie , either on the defensive from Dan 's scornful and lewd attacks or trying to gain a little ground on him in their war of love . This couple is totally effed up but you leave the movie rooting for them and their bid to keep a little independence as they die to their selfish individual natures . Great job , Butler brothers I 'd recommend this movie to anyone who is n't shy of cuss words and sex talk . " ,7
" A snappy indie comedy . . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is a snappy indie film made by the Butler brothers , who split writing , directing , editing , cinematographing and starring duties between them . The film is structured around a lengthy conversation between Dan and Lisa , a couple that were engaged until he walked in on her with another woman . It 's full of crackling , funny dialogue and fairly insightful observations about people and relationships . I 'm sure the filmmakers have heard this from countless viewers , but the film fits in the same stylistic and thematic universe as early 90s indies like Richard Linklater 's work and , in particular , Kevin Smith . From Linklater we 've got the dialogue based film , echoing something like Before Sunset . The Butlers clearly love the way people talk and take great pleasure in crafting literate , but profane banter for the two lead characters . In that respect , there 's a lot of Kevin Smith in here . He 's become the target of a lot of haters , and certainly his recent films have their flaws , but I still really like Clerks and love Chasing Amy . Confusions exists in the same universe as these films , and is perhaps even more professional looking and certainly better acted than Clerks . The film centers almost exclusively on a real time conversation between Dan and Lisa , which is occasionally interrupted by talking head video of Dan and Lisa reflecting on the relationship . The talking head segments keep things from getting tedious , it 's not easy to keep an audience interested when your film has only one setting and two characters , but the fairly consistent hit ratio on jokes made it work . The film uses slightly stylized dialogue , the characters speaking the way we 'd all want to speak , in witty , literate sentences , rather than the halting , um interrupted way that most of us actually speak . I like this kind of dialogue , it helps to keep things a bit lighter . The film works best when it remains in an emotionally real universe , and allows the characters to go to a darker place . Dan vacillates between likability and douchebaggery in a way that makes us understand why she could like him , but also sympathize when she rejects him . In the way that a lot of male filmmakers do , our point of view character is the male , we understand what he 's doing , but Lisa remains more enigmatic . She seems like an artsy person with larger concerns , why was she attracted to Dan in the first place ? The film does a good job of showing how he can be charming at moments , and that the two of them can work well together . Because we 're coming in after the relationship is over , the two of them focus on the bad times , but there 's still that rapport and connection that draws them together . Not to dwell on Smith , but the emotional arc of their relationship is reminiscent of Chasing Amy , with a less experienced male letting his insecurity destroy the relationship . It 's a relatable arc , and I think it works here by giving Dan a motivation for some of his hurtful moments . Not that Lisa is devoid of negative characteristics , there 's a balance in the relationship , but I feel like we 're given less access to her internal motivations , or perhaps they 're just less relatable to me . Either way , the characters work fairly well . While I liked the dialogue , I had an issue with the way it was filmed . A lot of the scenes were shot in lengthy singles , with the camera panning from character to character as they spoke . The problem is , the characters would always pause as the camera panned , then start when it was on them . This made things feel a bit unnatural . It would have been better to keep the conversation flowing naturally and just catch up as they panned . There 's not that much to do with this film visually , but there are some interesting shots , the final scene is really well staged , definitely the visual highlight of the film . In terms of acting , the film 's got its on and off moments . Naomi Johnson , who plays Lisa , is great in the talking head scenes , but not as believable in the real world scenes . Brett Butler as Dan is really funny , but not always believable on an emotional level . But , ultimately , the film has enough to entertain . I love snappy banter , and this film provides that in spades . There 's a lot of really funny stuff here , and also a believable emotional story . That 's more than you 'll get out of virtually all Hollywood comedies . It 's a bit reductive to say , if you enjoy Kevin Smith movies , you 'll enjoy this , but really , that 's the best thing I can say . It 's that same style and the same satisfaction . " ,8
" lol . I 've seen this film 3 times and each time I find myself laughing more and more . The character concept and developments is genius . For example Dan 's dilapidated sense of reality is beautifully executed by Brett Butler 's acting . His nonchalant delivery of some ridiculous linage would be enough of a film . Throw in his counterpart Lisa played by Naomi , brilliant . Initially one thinks ; here we go , another story of opposites in a tough relationship . But to go against the grain the Butler Bros develop a counter character equally as dilapidated as Dan - the two just do n't get it . It would have been great to see a little more dynamic with the settings but the production values for an Indie film more than make up for it . The use of music in the back was also tasteful . I 'd recommend hitting the L.C.B.O picking up some peach schnapps a century Sam and a copy of this film . 9-10 . Great film . " ,9
" Awesome . . I love this movie . I scored one of the 10 autographed copies when this was first released . When ever there 's guests over at my place , one of the first things I mention is `` Confusions '' and that we need to watch it . I love Dans keen insight into love and women . The mans a genius . All the shots are great and the soundtrack is amazing . This is a must see and the guys who made this movie are definitely going places . My favorite part is Dan 's speech on fidelity and how Angelina is `` safe '' . The banter is great . Its like they 're real people fighting and do n't know the camera is rolling . Definitely check this movie out , you 'll love it . " ,10
" ' A fresh brew ' . `` Confusions of an Unmarried Couple '' is the third feature film by Brett Butler and Jason Butler , two Canadian-born brothers who love movies as much as they enjoy making them . Their two first efforts , `` Alive and Lubricated '' -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and `` Bums '' -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , proved that they could be filmmakers . This time around , they are filmmakers and not only is `` Confusions of an Unmarried Couple '' their most mature film but also their most genuine . `` Confusions of an Unmarried Couple '' is film that is not difficult to follow or comprehend . It examines the ups and downs of a relationship without dramatizing the painful process of `` getting over '' an ex-girlfriend or boyfriend . The Butler brothers deserve their share of praise for creating a film that is true to life , funny , touching , and equally abstract . They have found a formula that works and with this third film no one can deny that they are on their way to stardom . " ,7
" Best yet from the Butler Brothers . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is , quite simply , a hilarious movie . There are plenty of reasons to watch - intriguing characters , solid acting , huge plot twists - but even if those elements were absent the film is still a must-see for it 's sheer comic brilliance . From Dan -LRB- Brett Butler -RRB- and his rants on what type of girl he would cheat on his girlfriend with , to Lisa -LRB- Naomi Johnson -RRB- and her soulful , improvised break-up tunes , and the dialogue that the two share , there is no shortage of laughs . Confusions has all the witty scriptwriting and hilarious characters that made the Butler Brother 's previous films -LRB- `` Bums '' and `` Alive and Lubricated '' -RRB- indie hits . Instead of just putting out another good movie , however , they raised the stakes . Technically speaking it is a much better-made film , the situations that characters work themselves into are more outrageous , the plot twists are more extreme , and the improv work is simply phenomenal . Top it off with explicit sexual discussion , a whole lot of beer -LRB- plus the drunken philosophy and logic that often follows -RRB- and an unusual sex scene , and you get an idea of just how entertaining this movie really is . But , most importantly , it will make you laugh . A lot . So if you 're a fan of Substance Production 's other films , or if you enjoy laughing your ass off , this really , truly is a must-see film .

" Confessions of another Independent Filmmaker ... . Okay . My best friend and I were able to be at the South Bend Film Festival this year , and we were really excited to see what everyone else was doing ... and how everything works . We learned a lot from the festival , and met a lot of great people . But I have to say that it was Jason and Brett that really made an impression on us . We talked to them for at least a few hours through the festival , and bought `` Confusions '' before we had seen it . Out of all the films there , this is the one that stood out the most . The one that made the most sense to us . Confusions shows how things are in the real world . The real world is dirty , gritty ... and you hear a lot of the language on a daily basis . To try and accomplish that story without the dialog it had would be tasteless ... and untrue to reality . I personally can not understand how anyone could be offended by a film , regardless of its contents . Its all personal , its nothing against anyone . And I found nothing ` offensive ' in Confusions . The only reason , that this film did not get a 10 hands down , would be that the reaction time between the characters seemed to slow down with the camera movement , which kept them paused in action until they were in frame . This did not take away from the effect at all , and I am still very impressed with what I saw . I have watched the DVD 4 times ... Guys , keep up the good work ... and we cant wait to see you next year ! " ,9
" My view on `` Confusions of an Unmarried Couple '' . Despite what some people say , `` Confusions of an Unmarried Couple '' , was my favorite films that I viewed at the IUSB IVFF . I walked away from the film and was speechless . I loved the humor that was presented as well . Someone commented that it was `` Offensive '' , and `` Rude '' . The fact of the matter is , is that this film depicted life , and real situations that someone has gone through in one way shape or form . My overall review of this independent film is none less than amazing . The Butler Bros. are amazing filmmakers and are extremely talented . I think that these brothers from Toronto , have what it takes in independent film . Keep it going guys . Your doing great . " ,10
" the Butlers ' best yet ! . I 'm no film critic , but having seen all three of the Butler brothers ' eclectic flicks , I can confidently say that ` Confusions ' blows the others out of the water . Brett Butler 's hilariously twisted take on relationships finally finds its voice as this film dives into the many contradictions , insecurities , expectations , and indeed , confusions experienced by this couple when they confront each other for the first time since breaking up . Sexuality , ego , loyalty , and love are all thrown into question as Dan -LRB- Brett Butler -RRB- and Lisa -LRB- Naomi Johnson -RRB- meander through their mess of dashed expectations and clouded judgments . The dialogue is dense and rapid fire , sometimes straying beyond what is believable for the characters , but continuously delivering both sardonic humor and ruthless scrutiny of these surprisingly similar personalities . And even though it was shot on a shoestring , the photography and sound come together to bring the audience almost uncomfortably close to the story - right where the Butlers want them to be . All in all , a brilliant and profane triumph - definitely one for the grandkids . " ,7
" the butler brothers just get better with every film ! . Confusions of an unmarried couple is an honest , at times brutally so , look at relationships and the complexities that naturally evolve over time . The opening shot of Dan shows vulnerability and raw pain and it really sets the pace for the entire movie . Through the comedic sequences and at times , angry dialogue you still see it as the underlying theme for everything Dan does . I also found the balance between video clips , montages and dialogue to be pitch perfect . While viewing the film I never felt that anything was lacking . The acting was very true and on target , if not perfect , always genuine . I highly recommend this film for anyone who has ever been a boyfriend or a girlfriend , because surely it has something everyone can relate to . " ,10
" A film definitely worth checking out . . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is a comedy about a couple who are having relationship problems about two people who do n't know , if they love each other . They have a troubled past that includes an ugly break up and a very odd attempt at repairing the relationship . Soon Dan and Lisa try to find out where the relationship went wrong and try savage what 's left of their friendship . Confessionals of an Unmarried Couple is very good entertaining film , as it focused on the troubles of a relationship . The directing by Brett and Jason Butter was excellent . They intertwine the confessionals aspect within the argument the couple is having in the film . It is done well , as it gave good detail about the couple 's relationship problems while focusing on the development of each character . Also , the acting in this film was great . I thought Bret Butler and Naomi Johnson were into their roles . Their on screen chemistry was great and sold the fact that their characters were a dysfunctional couple . Confusions of an Unmarried Couple is a funny and interesting look at the ups and downs of a relationship .

" A totally decent flick . . I met Dan . I met Lisa . I really enjoyed meeting them . I really enjoyed the film . From the first moving image , each detail . The movie is intelligent . Anyone who has had a relationship longer than skinny pants have been in style should be able to relate to elements of this fantastic story and appreciate it for as much . Like any relationship , the film did have its up and down moments . Moments , I think , that were needed for full effect ; a ` surround sound ' of experience , if I may ... I actually laughed so hard that I slapped my knee -LRB- embarrassed -RRB- - it is true - and really - I even had to wipe away a giggle tear or three . Honest . I even yawned a bit , -LRB- see I am honest -RRB- , but mostly I enjoyed each moment of opportunity I was allowed to witness a convincingly honest dialogue between two freaks that are ` in like ' with each other and even may be in love . The music -LRB- or score to sound like I know what I am talking about -RRB- was wicked and perfectly in tune to the story . I noticed enough to notice that it worked for me and made a difference . And should the need arise to judge a book by it 's cover , the poster which included the portraits of Dan Lisa emotes a similar mood and energy as the film if I do say `` Confusions of an Unmarried Couple '' is a different kind of film and very much worth seeing . " ,8
" Relationship Film Or Soft-Porn Without The Sex ? . Never having seen a Butler Brothers Production before , I came into this film fresh and with no bias one way or the other . I 'd read both pro and con reviews of their previous movies -LRB- ALIVE AND LUBRICATED , BUMS , etc. -RRB- and thought these zany brothers might be worth checking out . Having received and watched CONFUSIONS OF AN UNMARRIED COUPLE , I must say that there are both pro and cons in this one little film and , unfortunately , the cons tip the scale a bit too much for a positive rating . The most appealing aspect of the film is undoubtedly the snappy dialogue and the comedy it contains . Watching Dan -LRB- Brett Butler -RRB- try to sneak his old mattress out his ex-girlfriend 's apartment was pretty damn funny -LRB- note : this is attempted while his ex is still in the apartment -RRB- . His comment `` We need to talk '' while peaking out from behind the would-be stolen mattress is quite hysterical . The downside to the dialogue is its delivery . Brett may be a fine film maker , but he 's not an actor . His lines are delivered in queue-card fashion with poor -LRB- or little -RRB- emotion . Naomi Johnson as Lisa -LRB- his ex -RRB- does a more admirable job , using both good facial contortions and voice modulation to get her side of the story across . The fact that this is a story about messed up relationships is old territory covered many , many times , too . This accompanied by the continual panning back and forth of the camera during conversations\/arguments makes for an old and stilted feel . I 'm sure the intention was to give the audience the sense that they were the camera , watching this story unfold , but the effect gets tiring and irritating after a very short time . The other sense -LRB- for me , at least -RRB- was that I was watching a soft-porn film without the sex . The verbiage was there the f-word being used liberally , as well as other profanities and felt abused\/overused rather than natural flowing dialogue or shocking . I 'm no prude and enjoy the occasional merry chorus of `` F-yous '' , too , but Confusions of an Unmarried Couple went overboard . I understand the budgetary constraints of such a small production and seriously appreciated what Brett and Jason Butler were doing here . They just needed to avail themselves of better filming techniques -LRB- i.e. , not the continual panning -RRB- and find an actor who could play the Dan character with an edgy style , and I feel almost certain that the film would 've received much more praise from me ... and perhaps others .

" You have to watch this episode !!! . After months of speculation , we now know what the Demon was looking for in Sam - a leader of his demon army . Sam wakes up in a mysterious ghost town - nothing is there . He meets up with fellow psychics Ava and Andy and they try to work out why they are here . They also find new special children , Lily - who stops peoples hearts when she touches people and Jake - who seems to have super strength . Sam explains to them about the Demon and they all are trying to figure out how to get out of the ghost town . Meanwhile , Dean is with Bobby and they are trying to work out where Sam is . Dean gets a phone call from Ash at the roadhouse saying that he has some important information . They travel to the roadhouse , but something unexpected has happened . Im not going to give too much more away , but this episode was one of the best of the season . We get to learn a bit more about the boy 's mother Mary and the question we all have is - how is she involved in all this ? With twists and turns and unexpected occurrences , this episode is not to be missed and if you love the boys as much as i do , you are going to need a tissue for the last part of the episode - it 's heart warming .

" Last Man Stand . Dean parks the car in a diner and waits in the car while Sam brings some fast food and pie . Suddenly he realizes that Sam vanished and finds the staff murdered . Without any lead , he meets Bobby and calls Ash ; later , Ash calls Dean and when they arrive in the Roadhouse , they find the place burned to the ground , Ash and other hunters dead and Ellen missing . Meanwhile , Sam awakes in the ghost town Cold Oak , South Dakota , with Andy and Ava and they meet two other strangers , Jake and Lily . The Yellow-Eyed Demon visits Sam in his dream and explains that only one member of the group will survive and become a soldier in his army of demons . `` All Hell Breaks Loose : Part 1 '' is another engaging episode of `` Supernatural '' . Now it seems that the war of the Yellow-Eyed Demon and his army of demons is set in motion with the contest of the gifted children in the haunted town . The conclusion is absolutely unexpected and probably Dean will make a deal to save his brother . My vote is nine .

" Works better the second time around . This is one episode that is definitely better on a re-watch . I found the commercial breaks to be distracting during the original airing , causing the entire episode to feel disjointed and off kilter . When I was able to sit down and watch the episode without interruption , I found that it worked much better for me . The plot is heavy on the `` Special '' kids storyline , as the summary implies , and light on much of anything else . We do find out some new information , though it remains to be seen exactly what will come of it . As a whole the episode is flawed and far from perfect , but still good . Jensen Ackles hits us again with his powerful acting skills , and Jared Padelecki shines as well , despite a few false moments from him in the course of the episode . Katharine Isabelle and Gabriel Tigerman are wonderful in their respective roles . And despite the fact that the promo for this episode gave away one of the most emotional moments , that moment is still moving and wonderfully portrayed . All in all a job well done , but one that desperately needs its second half to feel entirely correct . " ,7
" Yellow Eyes Has Plans for Sam WInchester . This is it . We 've waited all year to find out Sam 's role in the Demon War , and now the truth has finally been revealed - since his infancy , Sam Winchester has been destined to be the leader of the Demon Army . In All Hell Breaks Loose , Part 1 , Sam 's destiny finally seems to be minutes from being fulfilled . After a seemingly innocent stop at a diner , Sam mysteriously disappears , leaving Dean frantic . When Sam comes to , he finds himself in a ghost town , with no way out ; and he is trapped with his fellow psychics , as well as a few newcomers , including a soldier named Jake . As time progresses , it is revealed that only one man is supposed to remain alive at the end of Yellow Eyes ' little game ; and that man is ultimately the leader of Satan 's army . As we find out at the end of the episode , sometimes even the best laid plans fall short . Meanwhile , as Sam and co. try to escape , Dean and Bobby search for the missing Winchester . It is soon revealed that the Roadhouse has burnt to the ground , and Ash is dead . What of Ellen and Jo ? Despite the devastating setback , Sam manages to use his powers to communicate with Dean , who has visions of where is brother is being held . They rush to the scene , in time to see Jake go attack Sam from behind . All Hell Breaks Loose 1 was an absolutely phenomenal episode of Supernatural , written quite well by Sera Gamble -LRB- who seems to be taking a lot of crap from fans now that Kripke is out of the picture . Sure , it 's not quite the same without him , but I think fans should lay off a bit . That , however , is another story and so we will leave it at that -RRB- . Again , I was blown away by Jensen Ackles ' performance , namely that final few minutes after Sam has been stabbed . He holds his dying brother in his arms , repeating to him that everything will be fine , more to convince himself than to reassure Sam . The pain in his eyes when Sam goes limp is so genuine , so heart-wrenching . This man has lost everything ; his mother , father , and now the only one he has left : Sammy . Ackles is brilliant at nailing the subtle gestures in his acting , from the tender touch of Sam 's cheek to the gentle kiss on his shoulder . I have always found that Ackles performs better as the grief stricken brother than Padalecki -LRB- though I thought Jared was great at the end of No Rest for the Wicked , I always found Jensen 's performance at Sam 's death to be more emotional and effective than Jared 's at the end of season 3 -RRB- . In all , it was a great episode , ten stars . " ,10
" Sam and Dean are separated , and the reunion is what you 'd least expect . . For me this whole episode was about the final few minutes . Sam and Dean becoming separated , the ` competition ' between the demon-babies , and Dean and Bobby trying to locate Sam was all just a precursor . That final scene , Dean 's anguish as he runs to his brother , the hope fading from his eyes as Sam slips away and his heart rendering cry at the end , were the most profound moments I 've ever experienced watching ANY show . I can watch the end of this episode over and over . Excellent work all round . " ,10
" wowzers . I have been neglecting my reviewing duties and so have n't gotten around to doing one for the finale until now . And wow , what a finale it was . \* bows to the creative genius of Kripke and co. \* The reintroducal of Ava and Andy was brilliant , and they worked brilliantly against the two new characters also . This is one of those brilliant but oh so sad eps . We got to see Ava and Andy again , but then had to say goodbye to them \* sniff \* I totally did n't see the whole evil Ava coming ... and neither did Andy it would seem . Ava was a great special guest , which is why i was sad to see her go too , even with her new found evil character self . And if loosing Andy and Ava was n't enough , we also had to say goodbye to Ash !? I loved his character and took it pretty hard . Excellent use of him brining in a big secret though , and then dying before revealing it . A definite way of keeping the mystery about the show . And the hands down saddest moment of supernatural so far ... Sammys death . We all know he was going to be brought back to life because you know , whats supernatural without dean AND Sam ?! But it was still one of those heart wrenching moments which had me in tears -LRB- im a girl , its OK to cry at supernatural ... saying that though i defy even a boy to not cry at that scene ! -RRB- . Especially that heart tearing ` SAM ' from Dean . Got me right in the gut that one . oh before i go , i loved the whole dean having a vision thing , and his whole ` bring me some pie ' routine in the beginning . It reflects the brilliance of the supernatural team when even during the most tense and saddening finale , they can still manage to inject some humor to keep things from becoming emo sad . -LRB- no offence meant -RRB- also round of applause for Jensen 's comic timing which turns brilliant writing into fantastic delivery ! awesome , that is the word i would use to sum up All hell breaks loose part 1 ! XsarahX make sure y' all watch it ! " ,10
" Brilliant . The first time I saw this episode I was in total shock . Yes , I knew Sam will be back , But still I was stunned and angry . How could they do this to us and how could they do this to Dean ? But , I realized that this right there is what makes Supernatural what it is , They are never afraid to take us to the extremes and shock the viewer with our biggest nightmares . They are not afraid to provide us with answers and at the same raise new questions . This episode right there is the essence of Supernatural and they will dare to shock us again on every season 's finale taking our breath away . Sam is abducted and he finds himself in a hunted town , not knowing what could have happened to Dean . He meets up with Ava , Andy , Jake and Lily , All are kids with special abilities . Though , Freaked out himself , Sam has to hold on to calm down the others . Meanwhile , Dean and Bobby are searching everywhere for Sam when Dean gets a call from Ash telling him to come over to the Roadhouse as he found something dangerous and ca n't share on the phone . As they arrive to the Roadhouse , they found the place destroyed and every body is dead . Furthermore , Dean gets a vision of Sam 's whereabouts . On the other hand , Sam and the others find themselves trapped in the hunted town when Lilly is killed trying to escape . Sam teams up with Jake who seems to have a superman like powers , and try to protect the others . While on guard , Sam falls asleep and is visited by The Yellow Eyed Daemon in his dream , who tells him the truth about his mother 's and Jessica 's death , he truth bout his powers and about the upcoming apocalyptic war . He wakes up to find Ava is missing and he and Jake go searching for her , upon hearing her scream they rush over to find her standing over Andy 's corpse . She then reveals to Sam that she had been in the place since she disappeared five month earlier and that she is the only survivor of all the psychic kids coming to town . When she calls out a daemon to kill Sam , Jake kills her and saves him . Sam then tells Jake that they have to escape the place and not bow down to the daemons plans but Jake refuses telling him that only one will survive . They engage into a fight but Sam knocks Jake out when Dean and Bobby arrive to the place . As he runs towards his brother , Jake comes behind Sam and fatally stabs him in the back , leaving Sam to die in Deans arms . This episode have some nice moments and some sad shocking ones : 1 - I liked Bobby 's reaction to Dean 's headache . He was so fatherly concerned about him . 2 - It was sad to see Ash and Andy die . Those where very likable characters . 3 - Sam 's happiness upon seeing Dean was heartbreaking . 4 - Dean 's grieve over Sam 's death and seeing the life fade away from Sam 's eyes . This right there can definitely bring tears to your eyes . This one also raises some important question , some of which will be answered in the finale and some later on . - What did Ash know before his death about the upcoming war ? - Did Ellen and Jo die in the Roadhouse ? - What did Mary know about The Yellow Eyed Daemon and what was she apologizing to Sam for ? - What was the end game of the apocalyptic war ? - Why did The Yellow Eyed Daemon talk to some kids and not others ? - Why did other kids have far more developed powers than Sam did ? - What are Sam 's true powers and will he ever know the extent to what he can do ? - And most important of all , What will Dean do next ? " ,9
" A truly Sammy-centric episode . . Okay , first off to really appreciate this episode you need to be a huge ` Supernatural ' fan , or more specifically a Sam Winchester fan as nearly the entire episode centers around him . This is actually my favorite Supernatural episode of season 2 , and it has to be because of the wonderful performances put forward by the actors and actresses , not only Jared and Jensen 's , but those of Katherine Isabelle as Ava , Gabriel Tigerman as Andy and Fredric Lehne as Yellow-eyes . I remember i was busy the night that it aired and had to tape it . I got home at about midnight that night , but insisted that i watch it before i was able to sleep . I ended up watching this amazing episode on this crappy tape with bad reception about 6 times . Each time i watched it i became enthralled with a different aspects of the ending . - Spoilers - Comments like ` No goodbyes for Dean ' and ` Sam dies in his brother 's arms ' are just small , seemingly insignificant comments that mean so much . For Supernatural fans having Sam die in such a sudden , almost unexpected way was effectively executed and felt almost as if someone close to them had passed -LRB- i knew some people who , the next day , wore black arm bands in respect -RRB- . The performances , from Jensen especially , are amazing . As an audience we are pulled into this situation . These are brothers . One is dying . What would you say if you knew this could be the last time that you spoke to the person you love the most ? The relationship between the brothers has become so deep that it is a real shock to the system when anything this horrible happens to one , or really both of them . I urge you to watch this , or if you already have , to watch it again more closely . The way in which Dean lovingly strokes Sam 's lifeless face , Dean 's anguish as his brother slips away and Sam 's empty eyes would make even the most cynical person believe that this episode is a true masterpiece . The only quarrel i had was the fact that i knew the ending before it happened , thanks to an all too detailed description in TV week the week before . Thanks for nothing you guys . " ,10
" The Best Show Sinnce X-Files , No worries ... Sam is not truly dead . . Okay , the episodes are pretty much all excellent from Seasons 1 and 2 , this episode was well executed . Jensen and Jared are exceptional actors and are always surrounded by wonderful counterparts , whether a guest appearance or a regular . `` My take ; Sam and Dean 's Mother is some sort of part supernatural being and was kind of hiding out from whatever past she had . The yellow-eyed demon finally found her and corrupted Sam because he was an infant , Jared was older and more self aware . In the final episode Jared will somehow trap the demon and be forced to make a deal where the demon will bring Sam back and Dean will let the demon go . '' Or , Sam 's real father is the yellow-eyed demon , which would make for a really bad clich . I have faith in the writers that they will not make this show just another clich . Peace , Slackwoo " ,10
" Everything Happens for a reason , at least that 's what I hope . Okay , what is there to say about this episode except for `` WOW ! '' and `` I ca n't wait till part 2 of ` all hell breaks loose ' '' . I am a great fan of this series and I usually root for Dean but today I 'm rooting for Sam because something BAAAAD is gon na happen and Sam got all to do with it . His death is not without a real good reason . because if you pay attention to the different points raised during the season , we know that GOD , LIFE AFTER DEATH , Sam and their mother , their dad too and obviously HELL and the Yellow eyed demon will be key factors in part 2 . I just hope the inevitable does n't happen , Sam going darkside and SUPERNATURAL turning into Sam vs. Dean ... Evil vs. Good . because even though Dean is tough he is no match against a possible ` demoniac Sam ' . I think I 've said enough and most of it was n't about this episode . all I 've got left to say is i feel sorry for Sam , I empathize with Dean and i 'm disappointed with Ava 's reappearance and missing Jo Harvelle ... she is got ta appear again . " ,10
" One of the weaker episodes . One of the weaker episodes . Why ? For being a great show and all the plot build up the writers of Supernatural had a hard task at hand . No one can blame the writers for the story climax of season two being such a let down . The town , the special kids duel and Sam 's mother knowing the demon where all cheesy . The story would have made a great regular episode , but the writers had hard time trying too match the brilliance of the season one 's final episode . I was not surprised if the writers are tring to add new ideas for the season 3 story lines . 7 out of 10 . I feel like there is a need for more . Maybe I need to watch this episode a second time , or wait to see if season 3 will make sense out to the season 2 's story climax . " ,7
" Brilliant and Wonderfully Heart Wrenching !!! Must see !!!! . For the Supernatural regulars out there , we know how marvelous this show can be . This episode goes ABOVE AND BEYOND any of the great shows we 've seen so far !! Far from the comedic atmosphere of Tall Tales and Hollywood Babylon , this episode is much more somber . Jared and Jensen are both brilliant actors , and , especially in Jensen 's case , this episode shows just how talented they are . I taped this episode and have watched it four times in the past three days . The insight into the mind and soul of Dean Winchester makes this episode a must-see . It is touching , tragic , inspiring , and simply wonderful . This episode has just become my favorite Supernatural to date . I HIGHLY recommend that long-time fans and newcomers alike see it is at all possible !!!! " ,10
" Outstanding . At first glance , this episode is wonderful . Funny , achingly sad , and adorable all at once . But look a little deeper and you 'll find that What Is and What Should Never Be shows a level of sophistication , acting , series and character continuity , and polish , that will blow you away . Jensen Ackles knocked this one out of the park . Though he always does an exceptional job , he really took it up a notch this time . Never an off moment in the whole show . I have heard him referred to as a subtle actor before , and I think that comes through in this episode . The facial expressions , the gestures and movements are all spot on . You do n't have to wonder how his character is feeling ; it 's written right there on his face , and in his eyes , for all to see . He 's heartbreakingly sincere . Spectacular . Jared Padalecki also did an excellent job in this one . A definite must see for newcomers and regulars alike . " ,9
" That Was Just a Dream . In Illinois , while chasing a Djinn in an old building , Dean is attacked by the creature and faints . When he wakes-up , he is in Kansas , living with the sexy Carmen ; his mother Mary is alive ; Sam is graduated in Law School and engaged with Jessica , but they do not have a good relationship . Dean wonders whether his innermost wishes have been granted by the Djinn , but he is haunted by visions of a weird young woman . `` What Is and What Should Never Be '' is another great episode of the Second Season , actually one of the best of this series . The acting is top-notch and the dramatic story with another reality is excellent . One of the funniest moments is when Dean questions whether the Dijnn gave a `` supernatural acid '' to him . My vote is nine . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : `` Apenas um Sonho '' -LRB- `` Just a Dream '' -RRB- " ,9
" absolute , hands down brilliance . This episode has to be one of my most favorite , FAVOURITE eps of all time . It was heart wrenchingly beautiful , enormously sad , and absolutely charming . I had heard a lot about this episode before i actually got to watch it , but it lived up to , and blasted past , all my expectations . Dean gets to see how life could have turned out had hunting never been apart of his and Sam 's lives . The acting surpassed anything i could and would have expected from Jensen and Jared , Jensen especially . His reaction upon seeing his mother for the first time , was so heart wrenching . He played the confusion factor brilliantly , the guys face is like a book , you can read everything Dean is feeling throughout the whole ep . There is an absolutely adorkable moment with a lawn moment , I just wanted to hug Dean and squeeze his cheek lol . Jareds acting as the wussy brother was brilliant . Sam would have been a complete soft touch if the deamon had n't shown up when he was a baby put it that way lol . The addition of pictures of Jared and Jensen when they were younger , as a younger Sam and dean were such a brilliant touch lol , loved it . The attention to detail on this program is phenomenal . Especially things like drawing your attention to the fact that Dean did n't have his usual amulet necklace , by using an uber shiny one which makes you go ` hey wheres dean necklace ? ' Anyway , the ending is brilliance on screen , the choice between everything you ' v ever wanted , or the lives of everyone you have ever saved i bow down to the brilliance of kripke and the acting abilities of our guys \* bows \* definitely one to be watched over and over ... and over ... and one more time :D XsarahX " ,10
" Dean Winchester , This Is Your Life ... . What would life be like for Dean Winchester if he was not a hunter ? If Mary had not died in the house fire ? If Sammy had stayed in college ? In What Is and What Should Never Be , Dean sees just that . And begins to question whether the apple pie life is what he truly wants after all . It all begins when Dean is attacked by a djinn , a malicious genie who grants Dean the wish he has always wanted . When he comes to , he finds himself living with a beautiful woman , his mother is alive and well , and Sam and Jessica have just announced their engagement . Dean is happy , or so it seems . Unfortunately , John has died of a stroke , Dean has treated Sam like crap , and -LRB- worst of all -RRB- , the people that he and Sam had saved in the past year have died . After all , if the Winchesters are not hunting , they most certainly are not saving people . Thus Dean is faced with a dilemma - keep living in his fantasy world , or return to hunting . Because that is what Dean 's new life is - a fantasy , a hologram created by the djinn who had poisoned him earlier . He and a reluctant college boy Sam return to the warehouse where Dean had been initially attacked , where the eldest Winchester meets face to face with his loved ones . As Dean listens to their pleas , he debates whether or not to stab himself - live what seems like years with his family but ultimately die in hours , or force himself to wake up and lose the life he so desperately wanted . What Is and What Should Never Be is a beautiful episode which deals with Dean 's emotional struggles as he lives his fantasy life . His happiness when he hears of Sam 's engagement , his emotions when he reunites with his mother , and the horror when he learns that those he and Sam had saved had died : brilliant acting on the part of Jensen Ackles . This man is so underrated , would love to see him expand his horizons beyond Supernatural . He can make you laugh with his schtick and physical comedy , and make you cry with a facial expression or a monologue . And this episode , there is no exception . You feel for him when he realizes that he must give up the life he dreams of . I absolutely loved this episode ! I give it an 9 :-RRB- " ,9
" Fantasy land . Director and show creator Eric Kripke takes Dean -LRB- and the viewers -RRB- to fantasy land , we get a chance to see inside his head , to peak at his dreams and his deepest desires , to see what his life could have been like had hunting been off the table and his mother never died in that fire . The Winchester brothers are hunting a Djinn , when Dean is attacked by one and slips into unconsciousness . And Dean wakes up in a world where he and Sam are having a normal life , his mother never died , his father earlier of a stroke , Sam is in law school and is going to marry Jessica and he himself is working in a garage and having a beautiful girlfriend . Yet he and Sam are never close and probably will never be . And though he knows Sam does n't need his protection in a world where evil creatures are just a myth , he still misses his brother . Furthermore , he discovers that all the people he and Sam saved in their lives are in fact never saved because he and his brother were never hunters . So Dean has to make the most courageous sacrifice and give up his most desired dream , his and Sam 's only chance of happiness , and choose to save people 's lives as well as to be there for Sam in the real world . The writers have given Dean 's character a tremendous amount of depth and Jensen Ackles seized the chance . His top notch performance takes us on an amazing journey to see a whole new side of Dean . He was amazing showing every emotion . The guy could literally break your heart in every moment through the episode : watching Dean 's face when he saw his mother alive , his reaction to her touching his face leaning with her hand so as to prolong the touch , watching him enjoying her sandwich with great longing , his goofy smile mowing the lawn , his satisfaction just sitting on the porch drinking beer , his happiness seeing Jessica alive , his disappointment to being not close to Sam , his speech on John 's grave , and his unselfish ultimate sacrifice . This writers also dare to discuss the Sam and Dean relationship if they were not stuck 24\/7 in the Impala . What Sam would be like , how would he respond to Dean 's character and how would he accept his brother 's fallouts ? It was sad they did n't have the brotherly bond they share in their real life , and , Come on ! , he does n't even like Dean calling him Sammy , It 's like we are back to square one . This episode was sad to its last detail , reminding us how much the boys lost and how much they sacrificed along the way . On the other hand , The monster of the week was cool in a creepy kind of way with all the tattoos and his somewhat merciful way of killing . Bang up job Kripke on this one . Jensen and Jared , you sure excelled yourselves . It was nice to Samantha Smith and Adrianne Palicki back on the show . Jeffrey Dean Morgan was sure missed . But all in all great one . " ,10
" Good show . What is and never should be is great insight into the character development of the two main protagonists . I love how the show talks about Dean 's need for family stability ; Sam and Dean 's relationship is glued by their work ; They are so different they complement each other . Dean 's over confidence cause the show trouble , and his duty and honor is his salvation . Dean 's life would be one of trouble if he never had the outlet of hunting . The monster is well done . The ending gives the reason for the mission , and create round characters out of Sam and Dean . 10 out of 10 . Watch the summer rerun . What is and never should be is a fresh and different episode which build depth for the series . " ,10
" Drama\/Action - Not a Bourne Rip off - Very Good - . When I first saw the previews , I was expecting a bourne supremacy\/bond film with whoooohoooooo action that makes you say `` kill , kill , kill '' and gets you all worked up . But this film is more drama\/realistic and made me actually think about life instead of tuning it out . The action parts are very satisfying . Don Cheadle was great . If you are expecting something along the lines of The Marine , you will probably be disappointed . It is a little more mature than that . The movie surprised me in its creativity\/originality with certain scenes . overall , it is a drama\/thriller\/action \/ spy that I found very satisfying . some people on IMDb were complaining that it was slow , which it was , but do n't take that to mean that the film is bad . the movie is just more of a drama film than action at times . Go see it !!! " ,9
" Also saw a pre-screener . I was offered a ticket to a screener last Wednesday , and when I heard Don Cheatle was in it , could n't pass it by . I am not a huge fan of action\/suspense\/spy movies , but this one was a cut above the normal . It was more intelligent , and delved a bit into motivations , beliefs , etc. of terrorists . I went into the movie cold , with no idea of the plot , and I recommend that . Most write ups I have read give away too much of the twists in the plot , which I was glad I did n't know beforehand . Don Cheatle was excellent , and so was Sa d Taghmaoui . It was also refreshing to see Hollywood recognizing the breadth of Muslim philosophy for once ! " ,7
" An effective and thought provoking thriller thanks to Cheadle . A few years ago , Don Cheadle rose to the top of the acting world with dynamite performances in Hotel Rwanda , the Ocean 's series , Crash , and Traffic . He even got to fight in Rush Hour 2 ! So it should come as no surprise that Cheadle is electrifying and deep in this film , and it is his performance that makes the film what it is : a deeply engrossing political thriller that will definitely make the audience think about the movie , and of course , the current state of affairs in our world . Traitor did a very good job of stepping on the audience 's toes with some lines that could 've been considered prejudiced , and then catching themselves with actual truths about the war in the Middle East , in addition to religions themselves . This obviously takes place in the dialog of the characters , particularly those of Cheadle and Guy Pearce . The film 's dialog is well written , making up for the sometimes slow pacing scenes that take awhile to transpire . I 've already heaped my praise on Don Cheadle , but I 'll do it a little bit more . One of the crucial plot points is the true allegiance of his character , and it is the subtlety of his performance that will keep you guessing what side he is fighting for , though when the answer is finally revealed , you 'll think you knew all along . Some call this ` predictable ' . I call it great acting . Guy Pearce delivers a winner of a show as well as the straight edge FBI agent chasing after Cheadle , though his character has been done to death , to be honest . Neal McDonough is somewhat annoying in a supporting role as Pearce 's partner -LRB- though I think Neal is annoying anyway ... -RRB- , while Jeff Daniels is a nice addition to the team . I thought another great performance came from Said Taghmaoui , as Cheadle 's terrorist partner . After one of the better villainous performances of the year in Vantage Point , Taghmaoui delivers a performance just as deep and riveting as Cheadle 's . This guy is one of the more underrated performers around , and he should get more work outside of being a terrorist . I like the character development within the script , but I have some issues with the pacing of the film , which I 'll take up with our director . The film seemed slow at times , as I was constantly waiting for a particular moment to happen , while 5 pacing scenes would come in the way like a roadblock and just aggravate me a bit . It 's nitpicking , but some of the action was a little nauseating because of the camera . STAND STILL , YO ! A decent plot twist within the ending of the film does n't hurt at all , and adds a great element of surprise and depth to some characters . All in all , Traitor is definitely worth a watch if you 're looking to see something different to escape what is usually the graveyard for films ... August . Cheadle 's performance alone is worth the ticket . Taghmaoui 's as well . " ,7
" thoroughly enjoyed the film . i was lucky enough to be part of the `` first audience '' to catch this at a pre-screening , and i have to say that i really enjoyed this film . i do n't know anything else i could really say . it was suspenseful , had great twists , the acting was superb , and was a great story . Don Cheatle was amazing as ever , but i do n't want to give away any spoilers at all so i wont say anything about the characters . what i will say is that Jeff Daniels for sure needed more character development . of course Guy Pierce was great , and what came as a semi-surprise was Sa d Taghmaoui 's performance . very well-done by the cast and if Steve Martin is really the man who came up with the idea , he needs to keep churning 'em out . Traitor was a fit name for the film , and i would recommend it to all of you reading this . 9 1\/2 out of 10 " ,9
" Traitor is great film with genuine action , but it also makes you think . . For the life of me , I still ca n't figure out why Traitor is getting such poor promotion , but if I were the studio I 'd be trying my damnedest to get people into the theater to this . It has got a great cast in Guy Pearce , Jeff Daniels and the lead role by Don Cheadle . Do n't be fooled by the commercials that say that `` Traitor is this year 's Bourne Ultimatem '' , because this is clearly not true . While there is plenty of mystery and conspiracy to go around , this is a completely different situation that really makes the viewer think at the end of the movie . The great thing about Traitor is the fact that politics are n't heavy-handed or one-sided a la Syriana or any of the other cookie cutter political thrillers out there . The film really allows the viewer to draw their one conclusions based their own individual moral compass . I would say that anyone who is NOT looking for just another Michael Bay-esquire popcorn flick should totally love Traitor . - J. " ,8
" Thinking Man 's Spy Thriller . I usually go to Malco 's reviewers and then Rotten Tomatoes , to see what the consensus on a movie is . Well after going to see this movie with some very hardcore friends\/critics , we all agree , the professionals are getting paid off ! If it was n't for the good amateur Malco reviewers , I would have missed a very good thought provoking movies . I disagree that this movie stereotypes its characters , they are anything but . The acting is rich , the character 's are memorable , very great acting on all levels , especially the main characters , and respect is paid to traditional Islam as opposed to its radical splinter . About Cheadle 's character , you may have heard his performance is wooden , that is untrue , he delivers a moving portrait of a tortured soul subjected to a traumatic past and exposed to soul rending choices . If you follow it , Traitor will offer an excellent , thoughtful , journey into the heart of a complex issue . " ,9
" Gritty perspective on the war on terrorism . Don Cheadle selected another excellent role for himself in a movie that tells the tail of Jihad from the Western and Muslim perspective . If you are expecting an action flick , this is the wrong movie for you . Traitor focuses more on personal relationships than high-tech weapons . The movie makes good use of the actuals tactics and methodology of present day jihadists . But some of the terms , such as the halawas , could be better defined . The way the movie portrays interaction between American security agencies is interesting , but better represents the Cold War era than modern day . The limited information presented about Cheadle 's past also leaves just enough for the imagination to wonder . The one negative is that Archie Panjabi 's character was not developed enough . She did a solid job with the few lines she was given . However , a more developed Panjabi character would have added more depth to Cheadle . Overall , very good movie that makes you think . " ,9
" Very Involving Thinking-Person 's Story Great Acting . This was an excellent movie , a very intriguing and topical story involving terrorism with the basic message that there are good and bad people everywhere , of all races , religions , sects , whatever . The question in this film , for at least half of the movie , is : `` Is Samir -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- a good guy or a bad guy ? '' I do n't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything because that could easily be done while discussing this film . Suffice to say that this will keep your interest for the full running time and is a thinking person 's movie more than most . Cheadle , Guy Pearce , Neal McDonough , Said Taghmaoui and Alyy Kahn are all fantastic in the lead roles . The direction and photography also is top-notch . Those who pick apart this movie are nit-picking because it 's a very entertaining film while not overdoing the action or the stereotypical characters . One thing that 's odd about this film : it has very strong statements which will please both liberals and conservatives , both devoutly religious folks and atheists . It pretty much covers the field . " ,9
" Excellent movie . . This is an excellent movie . This was evident by the fact that while the movie was playing the audience stayed absolutely quiet . Usually when a movie is a clunker the audience starts fidgeting and becomes restless . This movie kept the audience 's attention . The star of this movie was Guy Pearce who gives a compelling performance as a government operative . Of course , Don Cheadle gives another excellent performance , this time playing a character whose loyalty is put to the test under the strangest circumstances . The story immediately grabs the audience 's attention and dramatizes the dynamics and issues relating to the government 's response to terrorism and provides an interesting take on the challenges associated with police work and undercover infiltration .

" Entertaining but nothing new . Back in my youth it was always the case that movie bad guys were pretty much an uncomplicated bunch . The enemy used to be either Red Indians or The Germans . Then came the IRA -LRB- for us Brits -RRB- and the Russians . Sinister foe 's who were willing to go that one step further for their cause . Since 9\/11 a far more fearful enemy has appeared on the scene . A brain washed enemy that is willing to die in the name of religion - The fundamentalist Muslims . Because of the terrifying prospect of what they have done and what they could do again , Hollywood have jumped on the band wagon and profited from a string of movies about the subject . None of which have been outstanding yet most have been entertaining . Traitor fits perfectly in that bracket . When straight arrow FBI agent Roy Clayton heads up the investigation into a dangerous international conspiracy , all clues seem to lead back to former U.S. Special Operations officer , Samir Horn . A mysterious figure with a web of connections to terrorist organizations , Horn has a knack for emerging on the scene just as a major operation goes down . The inter-agency task force looking into the case meets with Carter , a veteran CIA contractor who seemingly has his own agenda and Max Archer , fellow FBI agent . The task force links Horn to a prison break in Yemen , a bombing in Nice and a raid in London , but a tangle of contradictory evidence emerges , forcing Clayton to question whether his quarry is a disaffected former military operative -- or something far more complicated . Obsessed with discovering the truth , Clayton tracks Horn across the globe as the elusive ex-soldier burrows deeper and deeper into a world of shadows and intrigue . I like Don Cheadle . I can forgive him for one of the worst ever English accents in the Ocean 's films because despite that he is normally very good at his trade . He was brilliant in Boogie Nights and i loved his performance Reign Over Me . His performance is probably the best thing about Traitor . Although thoroughly entertaining , this film has nothing new in it to recommend it any more than say - The Kingdom or Body of Lies - and if you have seen either of those films you have seen Traitor . It 's good to see Guy Pearce too . A highly underrated actor who has hardly put a foot wrong since his days in the extremely naff Australian Soap Opera `` Neighbours '' . His best performance to date being the lead in the stunning movie `` Momento '' . This film reminds me a lot of the US TV series '' Sleeper Cell '' . Don Cheadle 's character is asked to basically do the same thing in this as Darwyn Al-Sayeed does did in that show . To sum up traitor is 2 hours of fast flowing predictable fair that is hard to criticise but is also difficult heap praise on . 7 out of 10 " ,7
" Tense film about terrorism with action , suspense and an amazing final . Thrilling and exciting movie about terrorism , spies and geopolitical issues . A firm believer in the Holy Quran , Samir Horn -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- , American citizen and former soldier in Afghanistan , lives a middle-classed lifestyle along with his love interest , Chandra Dawkin -LRB- Archie Panjabi -RRB- . He is actively involved in selling explosives to Jihadis . However he is trapped and meantime in a Yemeni prison , Samir is hit , and another inmate , Omar -LRB- Said -RRB- , comes to his support . Both men become close friends , subsequently getaway from prison , re-locate to Marsielle , executing a massacre , and elude authorities for some time . Later on they re-enter the U.S. , meet with other important terrorists , and together they scheme to place bombs in 50 Greyhound buses , one for each State . Using internet and mail they recruit 50 volunteers to carry out this gruesome aim . Meanwhile , the super-powerful CIA uses technological-gizmo-surveillance satellites , super-computers for people spying and hound terrorists relentlessly . The CIA agents -LRB- Guy Pearce , Neal McDonough -RRB- scheme a plot to chase the mastermind terrorist . They form a shaky alliance with Carter -LRB- Jeff Daniels -RRB- , the boss of Intelligence to break the terrorist ring whose objective is the bombing civilian targets . They try to stop cruel group who plans terrorist bombings by means an uncanny masquerade . Story 's core is interesting and script is dense with information and drama . The ultra-brisk editing and rapid scenes movement leaves little time to consider some inadequacies . The picture takes parts from The Siege -LRB- 98 , by Edward Zwick with Denzel Washington , Tony Shalhoub -RRB- about the dangerous terrorism Arab in US ; Spy game -LRB- 2001 , by Tony Scott with Brad Pitt and Robert Redford -RRB- concerning the spy-world and Body of lies -LRB- 2008 by Ridly Scott with Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe -RRB- about sophisticated methods of the international terrorism . Don Cheadle , also producer , is the main attraction , he sustains interest in this tale of treason and terrorism . Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough are good as intelligent super-agents and Jeff Daniels 's cool displaying a brief performance . The use of interesting messages to add weight to a romantic subplot between the terrorist and the Arab woman , though feels a little forced . The film packs adequate , evocative cinematography by Michael Muro and agreeable musical score by Mark Kilian with Arabs overtones . The motion picture is well written and realized by Jeffrey Nachmanoff . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . " ,7
" War on Terror made easy . Samir Horn -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- is an African-American Muslim who was born in Sudan and witnessed the death of his father in a car bombing when he was nine . He 's raised by his mother in Chicago and spends some time in the Army in Special Ops . Eventually he sees action in both Afghanistan -LRB- with the Mujahideen -RRB- and fellow Muslims in Bosnia . Samir shows up in Yemen posing as an arms dealer and trying to infiltrate a terrorist network for a rogue CIA operative . Through the recommendation of a mutual acquaintance , Samir hooks up with a terrorist named Omar but before you know it they both wind up in prison after being captured by Yemeni government soldiers working in conjunction with the FBI . After Samir and Omar escape from the prison aided by terrorist sympathizers , they escape to France where Omar introduces Samir to Fareed Mansour , Omar 's boss in the terrorist network . Fareed is no Mohammed Atta -LRB- fanatic ringleader of the 9\/11 terrorists -RRB- but rather an urbane yuppie-type who thinks nothing of drinking alcohol in front of Omar and Samir -LRB- supposed devout Muslims -RRB- . Fareed justifies drinking of alcohol -LRB- a sin in the Muslim religion -RRB- by stating that it 's necessary to blend in to achieve victory as the ends always justify the means . Somehow Aly Khan , an actor of Indian Muslim ancestry , seemed more like a stock Hollywood villain than a representation of an actual terrorist . Even less convincing is Samir 's ideological disagreement with Fareed while they 're having dinner at an outdoor caf . Samir makes it quite clear that he feels that Fareed has misinterpreted the Koran to justify violence . It 's obvious that the film 's screenwriters are trying to make the point that Samir represents the MAJORITY of Muslims that is , they are peaceful people who reject the methods of terrorists . Nonetheless , would Samir have risked blowing his cover by getting into an argument with the very man who he must prove his allegiance to ? Omar ends up making excuses for Samir so he gets by but the screenwriters can not help but continually remind us -LRB- in the character of Samir -RRB- that the majority of Muslims reject violence -LRB- whether you agree or not with that idea , it just feels the point is made ad infinitum throughout the film perhaps in order to ` soften the blow ' or ` balance things out ' since the films ' antagonists are indeed Islamic terrorists ! -RRB- . Samir is depicted as a man who totally abhors the killing of innocents . However -LRB- and here is the big problem with the movie -RRB- , he is willing to hook up with a lone rogue CIA operative -LRB- an intelligence contractor as he is referred to in the movie -RRB- , a person who he knows virtually nothing about , and plants a bomb in the US consulate in Nice at the behest of this shadowy figure , which accidentally kills eight innocent people . It just seems that there are too many action-thrillers today that trot out the tired storyline of inter-agency government squabbling , especially between the FBI and the CIA . How does this CIA guy pull off the bombing of the US consulate in France no less ? To my recollection , most US embassies and consulates are pretty well-guarded . And why Samir would even take a chance in conducting an operation such as this when he knows that something could go wrong is beyond me . While the rogue CIA operative must end up getting bumped off precisely because he is amoral and unprincipled , the FBI fares better here . The two agents , Clayton and Archer , are your typical good cop-bad cop characters . Archer is the bad cop and punches Samir a few times in an early interrogation scene in Yemen . But Clayton -LRB- Guy Pearce -RRB- is the ` sensitive ' good cop he majored in Arabic studies as an undergraduate and ends up receiving important information from Samir via email at a critical point in the film 's story . I 'm not sure exactly how Samir pulls it off and this is probably a first in the history in the fight against terrorism he manages to arrange for 50 would-be suicide bombers to be on the same bus and they all blow themselves up at the same time . Then he also manages to shoot the two terrorist masterminds without any bodyguards being present -LRB- Note that the main boss , Nathir , again is no scary Mohammed Atta-type but rather an ordinary businessman -RRB- . Traitor does a disservice in the fight against international terrorism . It makes it look all too easy with the good guys easily outwitting the bad guys . But in reality , terrorists such as the 9\/11 conspirators were no pushovers ; to remind everybody : they beat us we did n't beat them ! Some say that Cheadle 's performance here was excellent . I would have to disagree . He comes off as too middle-class , too intellectual to be a former Special Ops guy who is able to infiltrate a gang of terrorists . All the preaching throughout the movie reminds me more of a college professor trying to convince a bunch of undergraduates that his cause is just . In the end , ` Traitor ' tries hard to be as politically correct as possible , arguing that the war against terror is not antithetical to the teachings of the Muslim religion . But it makes its argument in such a heavy-handed and obvious manner that the film becomes overly didactic . Coupled with a wholly implausible plot , ` Traitor ' fails to convince us that we 're watching a story that mirrors something that could have come close to happening in reality . " ,4
" Forgettable , but Cheadle and Pearce raise it above mediocrity . Gripping but derivative thriller about terrorists and the people trying to stop them . Don Cheadle plays a Muslim who is a secret agent with the United States , under the supervision of a single man in the FBI , played by Jeff Daniels . No one else knows his true intentions , but he is connected to a terrorist organization by two other FBI agents , Guy Pearce and Neal Mcdonough . Cheadle has infiltrated these terrorists , lead by Sa d Taghmaoui , who also played a terrorist earlier in 2008 in Vantage Point , so deeply he 's afraid that he 'll have carried out attacks against the U.S. before Daniels gets what he wants . Traitor is clearly indebted to The Departed in its plot no points for guessing what happens to Daniels eventually and the Bourne movies in tone and style -LRB- although not nearly as shaky -RRB- . It never transcends its influences , and is thus , in the end , generic and forgettable . I do n't want to be too harsh , however . For a bit of mild entertainment , it 's well worth seeing . The final twist is great , if initially confusing and unintentionally hilarious . And the performances are quite good . I saw it mainly for Cheadle , who , as far as I 'm concerned , can do no wrong . Pearce is quite good , too . " ,7
" It Overcomes A Slow Start To Become Pretty Suspenseful By The End . After a bit of a slow start and a somewhat convoluted story , Traitor manages to overcome those weaknesses and becomes a decent suspense flick about the planning of a major terrorist attack on the United States , and the fight by various members of the law enforcement\/intelligence communities to prevent it . You have a tendency to want to dismiss this as just a right-wing anti-Muslim film ; then you have a tendency to think of it as a left-wing anti-American film ; then you realize that the story -LRB- since it makes you think of both -RRB- is actually pretty balanced . The excesses of both extreme Islam and American actions around the world are both noted , but the proper critique is also made of both types of excess , leading to the conclusion that the writers knew their stuff and understood the basic principles that undergird both Islam and the United States , and are n't afraid to criticize those who would twist either set of principles for their own ends . The movie revolves around Don Cheadle , who put on a great performance as Sadir , a Sudanese born American citizen . Sadir is a mysterious character . From the very beginning you question his loyalty - who is he really working for ? What are his motives ? In the end , you have the impression that while he 's definitely working for one side over the other , he 's much like the movie as a whole - he does n't really support the tactics of either , and is really more committed to a higher cause of his own definition . The movie -LRB- as is common with these types of stories -RRB- includes a sometimes bewildering array of locations that makes it sometimes a bit hard to follow . There are scenes in Sudan , Yemen , Spain , France , the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada and Mexico - maybe even a couple more that I 've forgotten ! That might well be an accurate portrayal of how these plots are developed but it 's a bit confusing as you 're trying to follow the story . The plot is truly frightening . 50 Islamic extremists have been planted in the U.S. and are living normal lives -LRB- some married with children -RRB- waiting for their orders to put the plot into action . The plan is to simultaneously detonate bombs on 50 buses around the country to make the point that no one anywhere in the U.S. is safe . There 's an interesting look at some of the strategies that might be used to communicate . As the point at which the plot is to be pulled off approaches , there 's real suspense over whether it will be successful . Overall , this is a pretty good movie . " ,7
" A well made thriller dealing with a very tricky subject . . This film deals with terrorism , in particular terrorist acts performed in the name of Islam . As you can imagine , it 's quite a tricky subject to make a movie about , particularly in this day and age . To a large extent , and going by my limited knowledge of the subject , I think the filmmakers pulled it off . The story follows two characters , Samir Horn , a devout Muslim , and Roy Clayton , an FBI agent , out to thwart the attempts of a particular group of Muslim terrorists that Samir is involved with . Samir Horn was born in Sudan , North Africa , where he was brought up as a Muslim by his father , who was killed in a car bomb . Having immigrated to Chicago with his mother he became a soldier and trained as an explosives expert . Having served in Afghanistan he becomes radicalised and stays there after his tour of duty is over . The film picks him up in Yemen where he is visiting an old friend from Afghanistan and , at the same time trying to sell them some explosives . The compound is raided by the Yemeni police and Samir is arrested . Whilst in police custody he meets Roy Clayton and his colleague Max Archer , who try to get him to give them evidence of the terrorists in exchange for passage back to America . He refuses and ends up in a Yemeni jail . Here he is befriended by Omar , who was also at the compound and is deeply involved with a terrorist cell . They escape and head to Marseilles , southern France , where another bombing is planned but fails to take place . Meanwhile , Clayton and Archer are monitoring things trying to find Samir . He is their only lead to the terrorists . The group now moves to Niece where Samir successfully sets off a bomb at the American consulate . Moving again to London we get a hint that Samir is not all he seems when he meets a shady character called Carter . The plot then moves across the globe to Canada and then to the United States where a truly terrible act is planned . Samir is now clearly having a clash on conscience , should he follow his faith , or the terrorists . I could say a lot more about this very intriguing film , but I do n't want to give too many spoilers away . This is a pretty well made film , obviously on a limited budget , but I though it was well shot and some great locations were used . Very decent performances from all of the cast , honorable mentions go to Don Cheadle as Samir Horn , Guy Pearce as Roy Clayton -LRB- great accent -RRB- , Sa d Taghmaoui as Omar , Neal McDonough as Max Archer , Alyy Khan as Fareed and Jeff Daniels as Carter . As I 've already said , this is a very intriguing film tackling a very delicate subject , which I thought was done pretty well . It 's quite a taught thriller with plenty of plot twists to keep you watching . It did get a little bogged down in the last third , but over all I thought is was quite an exciting and thought provoking film , recommended . My score : 6.7 \/ 10 " ,7
" Sacrifice a few . Save thousands . . This film has caught me off guard a few times . At first I thought Samir Horn -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- was trying to infiltrate the terrorist organization who are suicide bombers that believes in something like the Qur ` an by earning there trust , but later it seemed that he was actually loyal to the terrorist organization or even a double agent . And thought it would show the film in the terrorist point of view from the main character , which probably would n't have sit right with most Americans . But later it is revealed that he does work for a organization that is trying to take down the terrorist group leader Nathir and get a hold of the terrorist plans . Even while playing this guessing game , I did n't feel cheated because it was well crafted and gave some clues . I found the whole premise of Samir going to prison in order to befriend Omar who is a member of the terrorist organization a bit over the top , but there is way more over the top stuff that happens in these types of genres . I found the joke about how the suicide bombers are on a mission to get laid with 72 virgins pretty funny . Since it is pretty much the truth , but the film shows that not every people that believe in Allah are bad people and even the revealing of Samir 's past shows this , who is also a firm believer in Allah . In fact I did n't necessarily hate Samir or Omar , even if Omar is a real terrorist for some reason . Maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous , although being courageous is n't necessarily a good thing . So basically agent Roy Clayton investigates a dangerous international conspiracy responsible for a prison break in Yemen , a bombing in Nice and a raid in London . And all clues seem to lead back to a former U.S Special Operations officer , Samir horn . But soon contradictory evidence emerges , forcing Clayton to question whether his suspect is a disaffected former military operative or something more complicated , like the movies tagline . I was expecting some flashy fast paced spy movie but it turned out different from what I expected in that , it has some good drama to go with the action in fact the film has more drama than action . The first hour of Traitor was simply great , but after the first hour it started to lose it 's entertainment value and became a bit tedious . The parts after the first hour was n't bad , but just was n't good as the first hour of the film which kept me guessing . After the first hour , things start to get predictable , not that I knew what the ending was going to be or Samir 's last plan , but I knew what direction it is going . The stupid character decisions that jeopardize the mission got a bit irritating as well , it just seemed illogical and irrational . It was a decent espionage thriller with few glitches to sum it up . 7.4 \/ 10 " ,7
" Intelligent and subdued . . When it comes to films about terrorism , the Hollywood market is one dominated by the exploits of cowboys and tough-headed , no-crap Americanism that one might get a kick out of every now and again if it does n't take itself too seriously -LRB- Die Hard -RRB- , but too often submerges any substance and truth to the situation by trying to please the popcorn-munching audience members too eagerly . Such ventures into the often complex and extremely conflicted area of politics , war and current social prejudices are subsequently left alone by those the film ostensibly tries to draw in -LRB- those looking for intelligent , insightful political drama -RRB- and instead adopted and loved by people riveted by your average Michael Bay movie . It 's just about safe to say that those movies have their place , as most movies do , but that when you start mixing real-life affairs and especially those linked to such acts as terrorism and religion you begin unravelling something that really should be left alone if you 're not going to deal with it in a dignified manner . Traitor , which comes from director Jeffrey Nachemanoff -LRB- known for his script The Day After Tomorrow -RRB- , certainly does n't shy away from this sense of action that permeates the average political action thriller , but it is n't ruled or dominated by it either . Instead the movie exists as a tightly wound , exciting experience , but one that draws far more of its compelling moments from elements grounded in reality through both ethical discussion and the characters that drive the thing forward . The usual twists and turns in narrative are here -LRB- so much so that I 'm consciously going to avoid giving any form of a synopsis for the sake of preserving vital turning points -RRB- , but they refuse to submit to banal contrivances and absurd mystery tangents that take far too long to reveal themselves . Rather , Nachemanoff fools the viewer many times and keeps them guessing as to where all of this is going , yet never neglects them to being mere witnesses to a bunch of calloused details and bullets flying around the screen . The script is well paced and focused , with plenty of time-out segments that develop character and plot significantly , with little excess . One could argue that perhaps Traitor is a little too long for it 's own good ; there are moments where the movie slows down to snail 's pace for the sake of filling in plot holes and making sure the viewer is up to speed with what is going on , but such instances never become overbearing , nor do they drown out any tension developed up until that point . Yet without these points , Traitor would n't be quite the experience it is , mainly because a lot of the movie 's ability to draw you in through its central characters , their moral dilemmas involving what they feel they have to do , and the repercussions of such actions . By tackling such detailed issues head-on , Nachemanoff makes sure to avoid the pitfalls of your common political thriller ; the decisions presented here are presented exactly as such ; there are consequences , there are doubts and there are conflicts inside and outside said people that manifest throughout and permeate the entire feature ; Traitor dances with the people behind the FBI suits and the skull-caps , and it makes sure that they are n't mere action-movie caricatures for the sake of preserving its ultimate drawing point reality . Of course , a large portion of the movie 's ability to suspend disbelief is through the performances of the central cast who embody their characters with a convincing sense of realism throughout . Here , nobody is safe , and a few important characters bite the bullet , yet often they will come and go without melodramatic excess , imbued with a dramatic but grounded temperament . While I could go on about each of the actors ' performances here , it must be stated that the key portrayal comes from lead man Don Cheadle who reminds us once more of the talent he has for nuanced subtlety that he so obviously possesses . In the end however , it 's this consistency in grit and cerebrally engaging tone that makes Traitor a far greater whole than the sum of its parts . By no means is it a perfect motion picture ; as a movie it lacks an immediately definable structure that meanders from time to time , and the eventual conclusion does feel a little half-baked , but for the most part , Nachemanoff does well to craft an intelligent and subdued take on a genre too often obsessed with gung-ho escapades and mawkish sentiments . - A review by Jamie Robert Ward -LRB- http:\/\/www.invocus.net -RRB- " ,7
" Pretty solid advisers bring it home . From my experience , this movie does a pretty good job explaining why it is so difficult to get bin Laden . From the dialog at the bar in France where the debate the Haditha to the use of tradecraft , the technical advisers are to be commended for getting it right . I was n't watching for all of the details , but the movie team understands the Islamic jihad movement -LRB- in concept -RRB- and I did not see any -LRB- glaring -RRB- mistakes . I always find it funny , however , when they show the NSC meeting . It is always the huge round table with people who have `` SURPIRSE '' intelligence that they were n't sharing with the rest of the council . Riiiight . So , a little Hollywood to spice up an otherwise pretty solid movie . Don Cheadle gives an excellent performance that captures the essence of ` what ' you would have to become , in order to do what his character did in this movie . " ,9
" Move Beyond the Movie to the Message . In the middle of our world 's hard look at the Muslim religion and the Asian world in general , the movie Traitor is just one of many that has come up in the last couple years to focus on the world of Muslim suicide bombers and `` terrorists . '' I have trouble with the word terrorist because it assumes that someone is trying to cause terror . I am not sure this is always true of Muslim extremists , but in the American mindset right now , Muslim often equates terrorist . Or if you say the word terrorist , they are likely to think of those from traditional Muslim countries . The question this movie prompts in my mind is who does the title refer to ? Who is the traitor ? Does it refer to Samir , who betrays those who trust him ? Is it the men who have twisted the message of Islam to include radical killings ? Are they traitors to Islam because they have walked away from the true message ? Is it Roy , the American agent who assumes he understands the situation and is hunting down the one man who is actually capable of stopping a crime ? In this movie we meet Samir , whose father was killed in a bombing . Now he builds explosives that he sells under the table to militants . We assume he is a Muslim extremist . He goes to a prison camp and , after a rocky start , is befriended by another Muslim extremist . They escape their prison , and that 's when the fun begins . They linger in a spot , finding recruits and running missions until their location gets tracked down . Then they move onto another place . Wherever they go , they try to blend in with the locals . They are complete in their devotion to the tasks set before them . Samir gives careful training on the mechanics of setting off a bomb in a public place . Throughout the film Don Cheadle plays Samir like a patriot . He shows little emotion , but he is dedicated to the cause . Only the audience sees how much he sacrifices to stay on this course . This movie was a thinking man 's movie . There is lots of action and intense dialog . But your mind will be spinning . The issues in this film are so relevant to today 's culture wars . The cast is superb . Don Cheadle may get a nomination for this role . Said Taghmaoui certainly deserves a best supporting actor nomination for his role as the captain to the band of militants . So you could enjoy this movie just as a movie . It is entertaining , suspenseful , thought-provoking , and action-packed . But I think we can take it deeper . Movies are signs of our times . What lessons can we learn here ? There is a final conversation that ends this movie that leads me to believe this ai n't just a movie . This is real-life , and if we want things to change , we need to heed the final words and encourage others to do the same . " ,10
" This Movie Is A Traitor . If asked to guess who came up with the fun idea of winding down the summer movie season in an election year with a War on Terror thriller , most people would not name Steve Martin . But the erstwhile `` wild and crazy guy '' does indeed get the story credit for Traitor , a confused spy movie that strains to give an evenhanded portrayal of Islam even as it unwittingly fans the flames of anti-Muslim sentiment . Don Cheadle stars as Samir Horn , a devout American Muslim arrested in Yemen for attempting to sell explosives to an Islamic terror organization . While imprisoned , Samir befriends and gains the trust of Omar -LRB- Said Taghmaoui -RRB- , one of the terrorist cell 's top operatives . When his colleagues arrange a jailbreak , Omar brings along Samir and his extensive knowledge of blowing stuff up real good . They plan to bomb the American consulate in Nice and culminate with a dramatic display of deadly force within the United States . Two FBI agents are trying to prevent that from happening . Agent Archer -LRB- Neal McDonough -RRB- is the dead-eyed hard case of the `` kill 'em all , let God sort 'em out '' school . His partner , Agent Clayton -LRB- Guy Pearce -RRB- , is the son of a preacher and studied Arabic cultures in college , and he is the mouthpiece for the movie 's `` fair and balanced '' views . As such , Pearce gets stuck with all the expository dialog about how every religion has its fanatical wing , but most Muslims are good people like you and me . The movie surrounding him does n't tend to back up those words , however . There 's a terrorist around every corner in Traitor , to the point where you start wondering if `` Steve Martin '' is a pen name for Dick Cheney . Samir himself is meant to be an ambiguous figure ; in spy terms he 's an `` asset , '' but to which side ? Is he a CIA mole or has he become a fanatic ? There 's very little suspense to be found in that question , unless you can make yourself believe in a major American theatrical release starring Don Cheadle as our hero , the Islamic terrorist . We 're always one step ahead of the twists and turns Traitor throws at us , until they become so ludicrous that it 's hard to keep up . Even if you give Traitor the benefit of the doubt regarding its depiction of Muslims , the movie is sunk by its dramatic failings . Cheadle gives a low-key performance that 's a kind way of saying `` boring '' and the manufactured suspense is undercut by too many dull , talky scenes . This is one Traitor that should have never been released . " ,4
" Betrayed by the poster ! -LRB- Screen -RRB- . NB : the French poster is different from the US one !

So I choose this movie for the kid of my friend and me , looking at the poster , because I thought it was an action movie with a lot of car chases , gun fights , explosions , In reality , the hero is an undercover agent in a terrorist cell , so it is more a passive tension than an active one . It 's about moral choices , how far you can go without crossing the lines . I found it particularly interesting , especially when he set up a real bomb attack against an American consulate . On the other hand , I feel uneasy with the fact that the terrorist are integrist Muslims because my friend is Muslim . So for a kid , seeing that bad guys speak arabic like his family can be really disturbing ! Finally , we did n't know how it ends because we left in the middle , just after they arrive in America ! Will the plot succeed , will he be killed by his `` friends '' , I do n't know . Sure , my curiosity is still there and I think one day , I will rent it just for the end ! Was the movie really awkward for the kid , was he tired , uninterested ? I really do n't know . We tried to sneak to see `` Volt '' but we just seated for 2 minutes before leaving for good . My first time that I cut a movie like this and for now , the last time , we do a movie with the kid . Paradoxically , Valentine 's Day passed and everything is cut . Like the movie ! Very sad " ,4
" Why ? . This film is OK ... I guess . Good acting and a decent story . However the ending really annoyed me . Basically Samir , played by Don Cheadle , is an ex American soldier who helped the Afghans during the Russian invasion and is also a devout Muslim . Because of his history and experience he ends working undercover in a terrorist organization . This is what I do n't get . Throughout this movie , he is present in the same room as all the men he is after on a number of occasions . Also he helps them carry out an attack , but he sabotages the mission so only a handful of people die and the effects of the attack are dampened . He then kills all the terrorists at the end . WHY DID HE NOT JUST KILL THEM AT THE START , PREVENTING ANY ATTACK Occurring AT ALL . WHY HELP THEM . He was n't gathering any intel , he already knew who the bad guys were ... he drank tea with them . I do n't get it . " ,4
" Fantastic Drama \/ Thriller . Great Acting by Don Cheatle . Do n't miss this movie . Don Cheatle has come a long way from the days he acted in the serial Picket Fences as a public prosecutor . His acting is par excellence , well balanced and effortless !!! It is really refreshing to see him in this challenging role in this movie as a Devout Muslim and bringing a different perspective about the Muslim Religion . To support and come close to compliment this acting was that of Sa d Taghmaoui . He is also brilliant and portrayed his role well in the movie . The story is related to the current terrorism issues , extremism et al. . It is gripping and well spread out through the movie and the 1 hour 48 minutes flies by in this gripping drama \/ Thriller . Do n't miss this movie on many counts especially the acting of Don Cheatle !!! " ,9
" If Only This Could Happen In Real Life ! . - Were my exact words to myself after seeing the surprise ending to Traitor ! I usually avoid Americans-as-victims type movies like the plague ! But Traitor is not your typical terrorist\/war porn movie . While there 's some violence it is never gratuitous , gruesome or exploitative . What you are going to see is an intelligent story , granted it 's a fantasy , but it makes many important points . First , and foremost , Islam does not condone the the killing of innocent civilians anymore than Christianity does . And we are reminded , by example , that the Klu Klux Klan perverted Christianity by striking fear in the hearts of thousands of people by burning crosses on their property , and by committing other very serious acts of violence against innocent civilians in the name of God and country ! Another message we hear clearly is that killing innocent civilians is never justified , and the ends do n't justify the means ! Since this film review has a world audience , I would like to point out that the United States government has not learned this lesson either ! The American fire bombing of Tokyo , Japan and Dresden , Germany during World War 2 are war crimes , plain and simple ! The horrendous treatment of Native Americans during the 16th -19 th centuries are war crimes . The deliberate and\/or reckless dropping of napalm on civilians during the Vietnam War is a war crime , too . The United States support of oppressive dictators , monarchs , and other assorted thugs is also criminal . But two wrongs do n't make a right . And one not need become a thug , killer or terrorist to thwart thugs , killers or terrorists ! One of the biggest problems facing the world today is a lack of education concerning what governments around the world do in their citizen 's name . We all like to focus on the other country\/person as the bad guy , while never owing up to our own government 's sins . It so incredibly easy to point the finger ! If all the crimes that the American government committed in its 232 year history were listed back-to-back , it would be a mile long . But the same could be said about many other governments around the world . So it begs the question - when will we -LRB- the Human Race -RRB- ever learn ? Innocent civilians are the vast majority of the world 's population . Do n't we have any say in any of this ? In my humble opinion , if you really want long-lasting change shove a mirror in your opponent 's face , instead of of some weapon ! As Albert Einstein once said , the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome ! " ,10
" Tired of fake 007 James Bond ? Here is REAL James Bond and no fake actions ! . Tired of fake 007 James Bond action where even the pigs fly ? Watch this real James Bond where every action is genuine . This film is a long needed replacement for all that boring , tiring and old 007 Bond spy thing . James Bond fans must watch this excellent spy movie packed with REAL action ! Today is Election Day and Obama is going to be the president I think . Well , the James Bond is black , too , in this excellent thriller . There are no invisible cars here , no lasers that are capable of burning half of the Earth , no caviar , no cigars . There are no any fictional gizmos or gadgets in this film . The hero uses only very real and very tangible things . Yet , the Good Ole 007 can not even come close to this Modern Bond . " ,10
" Overall fair presentation . `` Traitor '' works well for what it is trying to do , but is not breaking a lot of new ground in any one area . If you 're looking for a thought provoking suspenseful thriller that covers some political controversy , well , it suits this need perfectly fine . OK , so you can tell I am not super hyped about `` Traitor '' , but I do n't want to overemphasize that . In the areas where it excels , it does so marvelously . The cinematography , with the super low-depth of field close-ups and interesting bokeh , really helped create a unique mood for the movie . The pacing was decent and the acting all top notch . The musical score did n't interfere with the experience , and helped heighten the perspective of the film . The movie does a fairly decent job of humanizing the U.S. agencies as well as the terrorists and their motivations . I see a lot of people feel the views of U.S. policy as presented in this movie as being controversial , I more feel they are pointedly obvious and find it sad people find this `` alternative '' perspective unusual or shocking . But , I guess if you can approach the film objectively , it does offer a very sympathetic and humanizing perspective to all of the characters , regardless of their malicious intentions . Overall , I recommend the movie , but also feel there are a lot of other films in the theater now that should be seen first . I guess it depends on what sort of experience you 're looking for . " ,7
" Political Anti-American agenda . This movie is a poor excuse for someone attempting to make a political statement void of true facts . Before you watch this movie , be aware of the agenda set forth as follows : 1 -RRB- America is a violent\/evil country 2 -RRB- All religions are violent 3 -RRB- Islam is no more violent than all the others You will find the casting and dialog of this movie supports this untrue agenda fully . The Americans are portrayed as hot-tempered , angry , and prone to errors in judgment . The followers of Allah are portrayed as victims of American tyranny who are generally family oriented , spiritual , thoughtful and worthy of our sympathy . This movie is an insult to intelligence and true factual discovery . This movie erodes American patriotism if you tend to believe the message it puts forth . The Crusades was an act of self-defense from Muhammad 's wave of bloodshed , violence and domination over a period of 1,000 years -LRB- with significant conquests starting in 641ad to 1683ad -RRB- and the terror continues to the present day . This movie suggests a contrary theory to this fact but fails to support it 's claim . Western civilization knows the Golden Rule and assumes that all should abide by it . The truth is : they do n't . No amount of Hollywood propaganda will change that fact . To Islam , Hollywood are infidels -LRB- not worthy to live -RRB- . I would rather see a political movie that is validly realistic and not idealistically twisted and void of factual credence . " ,1
" same old American story . this is the same old American story , and it 's getting boring . This movie does n't bring anything new , it 's the usual terrorist action annihilated by the American FBI . Samir , the highly trained marine specialized in explosives , is a Muslim that is to carry an attack against America but in the last moment he decides that what he did was wrong and betrayed his `` brothers '' . The FBI took over and everyone was happy . It was waste of my time and i do n't recommend this to anyone who want to watch a good movie . Do n't waste your time , there are a lot of great movies with interesting stories , this one is just not one of them . " ,4
" The title says it all . . On a boring Friday morning with time to kill I went to see Traitor . I did n't have too much expectations , yet I was still disappointed . And judging by the amount of people getting up to go to the toilet , I was n't the only one . Maybe I 've just seen too many movies about terrorists but I think the characters are as flat as the plot line . Even the twist in the plot could n't make up for the boring first ninety minutes . This movie makes you think ? Well yes , why on earth did I just waste two hours watching this ? Even worse , I felt more sympathy for the terrorists in this movie than for the FBI or for the American people . The next Bourne ultimatum ? Oh my , I hope they 're not planning on two sequels ... " ,4
" Hardcore Pentagon Propaganda . This movie was ridiculous . I found the story to be pretty weak to say the least . It 's about an Islamic man , grouping with some terrorists in Jemen , to plot attacks throughout the western world . The movie was obviously created as a scare tactic for the viewing public . It should be noted that most acts of terrorism are done with ideological motivation , rather than religious ones , but still in this movie you see the ` terrorists ' praying to the east every other ten minutes , and in almost every line they speak about Allah , and their devotion to Islam . Besides the blatant anti-Muslim propaganda , the movie even contains parts where flashy images show regular looking people traveling on public transportation , who according to the movie really are terrorists who could be carrying a bag , a notebook , or simply people with an Arab appearance . After the movie was over I could n't believe the actors actually agreed to cooperate with this , but then I figured the Pentagon must be sending really big cheques to buy their souls . I do not advise anyone to view this movie , because the brainwashing techniques used , will probably scare the average viewer into submission . If you happen to be studying Propaganda Techniques used in Hollywood Movies , then this one is one to watch for you . " ,4
" I 'm all Cheadled out . . OK , OK we get it ! All Muslims want to kill as many innocent people as possible ! Americans good ! Muslims bad ! This film is nothing more than more right-wing propaganda . It tries to play off this intention with a few ` tolerant ' one-liners but the message is overwhelmingly prejudiced . The FBI cops are righteous and smart , all the Muslims are deadly killers . Cheadle is the American bred non - violent faithful Muslim caught in the middle . The film plays like a bad episode of 24 . Intense situations build up , only to dissolve with lazy writing cop-outs like oh , I have a stomach ache in order to move the plot along . The dialog , brought to us by Jeffery Nachmanoff , who wrote The Day After Tomorrow , is heavy-handed and unimaginably cheesy . Most lines are standard Hollywood crap lifted from other films . The weird thing is that the one and only Steve Martin wrote this story . Even more mind-boggling is why he would hand it off to a hack like Nachmanoff . Every role would have benefited from better , lesser known talent instead of rich actor dudes that are in every other crappy movie . Not that it was an exceptionally good movie , but Body of Lies is a better take on similar material , even if Dicaprio is poorly cast as well . Cheadle just is n't believable in the role . That last conversation between him and Guy Pierce is one of the most cringe-enticingly corny I 've seen in recent memory . My roommate actually got mad at me for bringing this home . I gave the film 2 stars because one star must be reserved for regressive and subversive hate films like Deuce Bigalow : Male Gigolo . In conclusion , if you are a conservative ideologue or republican moron looking for justifications for your judgmental world-view , this movie is for you . Everyone else , stay the hell away . " ,2
" If you 've read Fisk or Chomsky this will make you vomit . . If the middle east is something you have ever taken a serious interest in this will leave you seriously disappointed . Platoon , Saving Private Ryan , Appocolypse Now all had something you could at least feel a visceral connection with . This movie has none of these things . Far more hopelessly inaccurate films about the middle-east managed to create loathing towards the stereotype Arab hate figure - this film struggles with ambiguity . It wanted to be a grown up film about the failure of the human spirit that is war , it ended up being and empty double agent non-thriller . Its like trying to cover up for the most monumental cock-up humanity ever made by saying it did n't really matter , just caused a few confused spy dramas . Garbage . " ,2
" Message : Christians are terrorists just like Muslims . If you 're a liberal looking for some anti-American propaganda then be sure to rent this movie . All the reviewers who claim it makes you think and has a message are correct but it only makes you think for about two seconds - then you realize the attempts of moral equivalence between us and the terrorists are totally unconvincing . The movie wants you to `` think '' about all kinds of unlikely scenarios that are more likely to confuse you than give you insight into the world of terrorism . 1 . Samir 's background is so odd . He 's born in Sudan , watches his father murdered in a car bombing , is raised in Chicago by a full-on Muslim mother , then joins the US Army , then leaves the army and joins the Mujahadeen -LRB- terrorist group -RRB- , then is an moderate Muslim working undercover helping the US government fight terrorism ? It just makes you scratch your head . 2 . One point made in the movie is that Americans were once terrorists to the British - yeah right ! What a profound thought . The colonists were so well known for killing civilians deliberately . 3 . Did you also know America is a racist country ? `` America uses bombs on innocent people , too . They just have darker skin . '' I have no idea what that means . 4 . Because America treats Muslims badly is why they get involved in terrorism . We 're the cause . Very original . 5 . When Samir makes the FBI ten most wanted list -LRB- or whatever it is -RRB- , the terrorists tell him American put a fatwah on him . So again we 're just like the terrorists . 6 . The Klan burns crosses and calls it Christianity , so you see all religions have their fringe elements . So do n't single out Islam . I do n't even know how you could accept this argument . Maybe because there is n't one mainstream church that would speak in support of any Klan activity while no Muslim leader that I 've heard has condemned Islamic terrorism . I 'm usually good at not renting movies I 'm unfamiliar with unless I 've read some reviews , but I got this one solely based on the cover and got burned big time . It was only a dollar but out of principle I still feel dirty having supported this movie in any way . " ,3
" Are you serious ? . That 's a very convincing point you made . So let me get this straight , you did n't say wow , it was great for adults and teenagers -LRB- so they 've killed their chances at the toddler and senior citizen market ? -RRB- , it was above average but failed at being a really good movie , BUT kept you on the edge of your seat . Very concise and to the point , good job . I 'm definitely gon na go and probably see this movie or another one . Traitor was very edge of your seat thriller . The movie just does n't really ever make you say wow . The whole movie was the SAME from beginning to end . It was just mostly bombings . The story was way to confusing and was jumping all over . Despite that the movie was ABOVE AVERAGE . If the movie was n't so confusing and boring it would have been great . This movie had so much potential to be a good movie but failed . This was a GREAT MOVIE for adults to see though . I think most teenagers would n't enjoy it as much . So I do recommend this movie to adults . The acting was very good and Don Cheadle did n't fail once . He was great and really was a blast to watch in this movie . Overall though the movie was alright with very good acting . Go see it if you like thrillers . " ,10
" this movie is sick . I think that this kind of movies is unreal , and why is that ... its because this kind of movies makes all the muslims terrorist but the truooth that the Islamic religion is peaceful religion , like any other religion and muslims people which they are 1.5 billion are good , in the most , yes there are some bad people like any other race or religion , the people who makes the films just want to deform the image of Islam , for there own purpose , the stupid who judge people or religions and he do n't knew nothing about the truth , movies are made to tell you what you wan na hear not the truth -LRB- wake up and see the real news and not only what western says see what eastern says to be a judge -RRB- . " ,1
" Once upon a time , it was the Americans who were terrorists to the British . . Who is Samir Horn -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- ? The FBI wants to know that too , especially after a visit from Agents Clayton -LRB- Guy Pearce -RRB- and Archer -LRB- Neal McDonough -RRB- . Is he an opportunist selling weapons to the highest bidder ? Or , is he something more ? Maybe he is a plant by some US agency . We really do n't know . While Homeland Security is tracking down a bomb threat in the US , Horn is involved with Muslim extremist overseas . The interesting thing about this is that we visit the motivations behind the extremists in reaction to the American presence in the Middle East , and the racial profiling and religious prejudice in the US . Cheadle is perfect for this role . he presents as a truly converted and religious man who only wants to serve Allah . Is it all an act ? The tension is ratcheted up as the massive and ambitious operation in the US is set in motion . Will he make it happen or stop it ? Will they catch him in time ? Sa d Taghmaoui as Omar was also excellent , as was Pearce . The tension never lets up as the mission comes to the end . A great thriller that gives us insight into both sides . " ,8
" Delivers what it promises . As a suspense-thriller about Islamic terrorism , `` Traitor '' is tautly-scripted and well acted by Don Cheadle and a cast of mostly unfamiliar names and faces . It takes place in a breath-taking array of locales , shifting countries and continents with nothing more than a skyline and a subtitle to tell the viewer where the characters are now . The beautiful Archie Panjabi shows up all too briefly as the girlfriend of Cheadle 's character and is provided with little back story , as is also the case with most of the other players . It is difficult to become fully invested in characters about whom you are told so little -- but the story carries you along and certain of the mysteries are left hanging , even when the film ends . But , although it came and went without much notice , `` Traitor '' is well worth seeing . " ,8
" Don Cheadle channels Tim Meadows . Is Don Cheadle a terrorist or an undercover operative ? The suspense is killing absolutely no one . By the numbers thriller with predictable outcome . Cardboard characters , clumsy emotional manipulation , implausible storyline and clich twists weigh against decent production values , competent acting and a reasonably balanced portrayal of participants in the war on terror . Terrorist Thriller # 0988047 should turn a moderate profit . Hey , Hollywood is a business so one ca n't fault the producers for not taking risks . Nevertheless , it 'd be nice if they threw in a few curveballs so we 'd know that the script was n't written by computer . Steer clear of this poor man 's ` Syriana ' if you 're looking for something new . " ,4
" underwhelming . talk about high hopes being dashed.seeing the trailers for this film starring Don Cheadle , i was convinced it would be a great movie.sadly , i found it boring , predictable , muddled , pointless.I like Don Cheadle a lot.but i think he made a bad decision to star in this movie.Guy Pierce , Neil McDonough , and Jeff Daniels co star.a case of a great cast being wasted , except for guy Pierce , who i was impressed with.otherwise , this movie is just filled with despair and no hope.it 's got a fairly high rating of 7.2 \/ 10 , which i would say is way , way too generous.maybe i just was n't in the right mood or frame of mind for this movie.anyway , for me , Traitor is a 4\/10 " ,4
" Plot Holes . Since this was a movie I gave it 8 stars . It was interesting and absorbing with only a few plot goofs to get in the way . To talk about them means to reveal some things about the picture . The first of three glaring errors was when Samir was in the garage waiting to meet his friend when his handler suddenly shows up and , of course , consequently gets shot and killed . This had to happen as at the motel it was brought out clearly that no one else knew about Samir but his handler . Now his handler showed up at the garage when previously it was made clear that Samir would go through great lengths to meet with him . The second goof was the explanation that the control was an `` intelligence contractor '' , what ever that is supposed to be . Let 's face it , if the U.S. wanted to get Samir under deep cover it would be handled by the top echelon of the CIA . Finally , how on earth could Samir get all of the 30 bombers on one bus from around the U.S. ? It can take three days to get from one side of the county to the other . On a lessor note , I found it amusing that terrorists would even think of bombing cross-country buses . Have you even been on one of those ? Hardly the people a nation would morn for more than a couple of hours . " ,8
" Very Good . `` All murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets . '' - Voltaire `` Traitor '' is another movie in the line of Iraq war movies . And while this film does not directly deal in the actual war , it does deal in the war against terror , which I am pretty sure are the same . Reminding me immensely of last year 's `` The Kingdom '' , `` Traitor '' follows the story of a Muslim man , Samir -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- who is actually a deep cover operative for a branch of the US government . How does this remind me of `` The Kingdom '' you ask , well if you have seen that movie you know that it casts a sympathetic light on the otherwise slandered name of the Muslim . Both of these films show that not all Muslims want to blow Americans up . Samir is a deeply religious man , who wants only to serve God , after being caught while trying to sell detonators to , who we can only call Terrorists , he is sent to prison . Now before I get to ahead of myself I have to let you know that the story gets sort of confusing at times , at least for me . For instance I am not sure why , out of all of the people there , the FBI chooses to interrogate Samir , but maybe I just was n't paying enough attention . Without revealing too much I will just say that Samir escapes and gets caught up with a radical terrorist group that tests both his faith in God and in man in general . And of course the FBI is after him at every turn . The FBI are Guy Pierce and Neal McDonough , who to their credit do a very nice job , although it was a just a little too `` Good cop , Bad cop '' for the entire film . Perhaps my favorite character has to be Jeff Daniels who plays Samir 's US contact . But that is just because I am a huge fan of his . In summation this is a great thriller , if you can wrap your mind around the plot , with great acting . Unfortunately I do not foresee any Box Office records being broken , or Oscars being won , but if you are in the mood for a good ride then I would recommend `` Traitor '' " ,7
" Oldfashioned in the good way . Sometimes good is bad and bad is good . Or put more simply : everything is just a shade of gray . What kind of shade just depends on the viewer , the perspective . Steve Martin -LRB- yes , the comedian Steve Martin -RRB- co-wrote a solid modern day spy saga that is fortunately neither black nor white . The only thing this movie lacks is emotion . By trying too hard to get the message across , director Jeffrey Nachmanoff has lost eye on the need for viewers to be able to identify with the characters and has thus made it harder to empathize with persons and causes . You will , but only in the second half of the movie . Still , the storyline is solid . And the acting is more than that . Don Cheadle is -LRB- again -RRB- magnificent and so is Sa d Taghmaoui . This is not an action movie , but a thinking man 's movie . And a good one too . " ,8
" A great film . Hollywood may be comprehending that the movies with political and war subjects saturated the taste and they left the unhappiness from North American people satisfied.The ones who are already convinced do not need any more ; and the ones which match with the aggressive foreign policy from the United States will not stop supporting the pro-America practices.However , that has not stopped many filmmakers from looking for new material ; in other words , they are more interested to focus on the peripheral aspects of war , instead than focusing on the war itself . So , we have seen movies like In the Valley of Elah and Stop Loss , which offer discouraging visions of the soldiers who came back from war ; movies like Lions for Lambs , Rendition and Syriana , which examine the ideology behind the conflicts ; and finally , movies which could belong to the action genre if it was not because of their political message , like The Kingdom and Body of Lies.But we had never seen the conflict from the enemy 's point of view , and because of that , Traitor is a refreshing and fascinating portrait of the causes which motivate the rebellion and disgust against the North American expansion . The screenplay from this movie has unsuspected levels of intellectual and emotional provocation.Screenwriter Jeffrey Nachmanoff -LRB- who is also the director from this movie -RRB- refuses to bring us easy answers about the ideological conflicts , and he portrays a discouraging vision of international politics , where concepts like loyalty and treason are neither good or bad , but only useful tools for manipulating opinions , public perception or legislation . Traitor is a truly audacious movie which goes more far away from the easy complaints of patriotism and human rights which other movies make , showing us that in fact , the world works on a gray scale , and not on the simplistic black and white the politicians want to make us believe . But , besides of all the ideological background from this film , Traitor work perfectly as an ambiguous and incredibly tense thriller , which has perfectly developed characters who occupy their ambiguous positions without revealing their clear porpoises , provoking a delicious suspense on the spectator , at the same time it is difficult to know where the story will take us.Nachmanoff 's direction is sober , something which works very well on the context from this movie.The performances are excellent , not only the one from the great Don Cheadle , but also the ones from the supporting cast , where the members who mostly stand out are Sa d Taghmaoui as a terrorist and Jeff Daniels as a security contractor , which is a role where this underrated actor shows his wide range , which goes more far away than the family films where we usually see him.The only fail I found on this movie is that the ending could have been a little more polished.But , in spite of that , I recommend Traitor with a lot of enthusiasm , because it is an excellent movie which does not only entertain very much , but which also leaves the spectator thinking . " ,9
" Traitor is Good Treason \*\*\* 1\/2 . Don Cheadle turns in another great acting performance . As a soldier of fortune in Afghanistan , who allegedly becomes a Moslem fanatic and throws himself in with Moslem terrorists , Cheadle etches a very interesting character . The truth be told , Cheadle is nothing more than a government operative living the life of a double agent . It is such a secret regarding his true beliefs that not even the CIA knows that he is really a good guy . For a change of pace , Jeff Daniels appears in a good film although his part is too brief . He is the agent who consoles Cheadle when a bomb that Cheadle has detonated killing 8 people only to fall victim to a bullet fired by Don to show the terrorists that he is one of them . The picture is fast paced and nicely done . The ending will make you smile . " ,8
" Quality Thriller shedding more light on terrorism than many recent efforts . It 's likely that many people have not heard of this film , as the press coverage has been relatively low key . This does not however reflect the quality of what is on offer . This is a great brave film and deserves your time . This films strength is that it is prepared to show logical and well reasoned arguments used by terrorists to recruit and carry out bombing , rather than other films that have created lazily caricatures that simply depict them as nutters . I.e. it treats its audience as intelligent . I imagine that for many distributors this was seen as risky and those with a conservative viewpoint were hesitant in supporting it - hence the lack of recognition . Ultimately showing the evil at the heart of terrorism , the main theme is the difficult choices facing those protecting us , and the damage that these choices can inflict on those in the front line . To pull this off the actors and director needed to be on top of their game . The pace at some stages flags but overall it all hangs together well and much of the slower stuff is needed to bring value to the action . The set pieces prove to be compulsive and realistic and worth the wait , with the ending rounding off the story satisfactorily " ,7
" This film contains an illogical conclusion . Why did Samir Horn use real explosives to make the bombs that were to blow up the Greyhound buses ? Not one of those terrorists were likely to test out their bomb kit to see if it worked . He needlessly caused the deaths of all of those people on the bus by using real explosives . I reasoned that he used fake explosives and I was eagerly looking forward to the look of utter frustration on the faces of the terrorists when they pushed their buttons and nothing happened . I was shocked when the bus exploded and killed all those innocent people . I am assuming it was some smart ass writer 's clever way of getting rid of all the terrorists at once . It was stupid and instead of Horn being considered a hero he should have been charged with multiple murder for that one act alone . Since no one else seems to have seen it that way , maybe it 's just me . Christopher R. Mohr Sr. " ,8
" A Solid Spy Thriller . Traitor is a decent spy movie that could 've been great , but was held back by a few problems . Run of the mill direction and a lack of consistent suspense were chiefly among them . But it is still a good experience for the most part . Don Cheadle is good , as always , in the lead role . He gives much subtlety to what could 've been a boring character . Guy Pierce is also solid , and Neil Mcdough is funny as a scene stealer . Jeff Daniels is given very little screen time and pretty much is wasted Traitor 's dialog is average , but manages to push the story along and create a little character development . The movie 's plot is its greatest asset . There are many unique events in the story . Traitor has multiple plot twists including one at the end which should surprise every viewer . Traitor 's direction is rather dull . It is adequate from a technical standpoint , but lacks personal touch . Traitor lacks a strong atmosphere . It could have been much better . If one chooses to judge Traitor as a thriller , he finds a mixed bag . There are several fights and small action sequences in the movie . These are decently choreographed and get the heart pumping . But the film lacks the constant suspense , even in calm scenes , that political thrillers need . This can probably be traced back to the direction , once again . Traitor will please most audiences . Fans of spy films and political thrillers will eat it up . But with better direction it could have truly been something special . " ,7
" A very good modern terrorism and espionage thriller . A good character study -LRB- excellent rendition by Don Cheadle -RRB- , a well crafted story , an action thriller film mingled with ingenious espionage and conspiracies . The greatest line of the film , perhaps the morale of the story , I think , comes at the very end : The Qur ` an says that if you kill an innocent person it 's as if you 've killed all mankind , but it also says that if you save a life it 's like you 've saved all mankind . Any gospel can be used to justify anything , but all affirm God , as the one who gave us all , regardless of religion , ethnicity , political affiliation the most precious gift of all , the gift of life . And no matter how we imagine the after-life -LRB- Paradise , eternal life ... -RRB- , we should respect and protect life , for as long or short it 's given to each of us . " ,8
" Successful flirting with a very sensitive topic . OK first things first . This is by far the closest portrayal of a Real Muslim . Samir has moral principals that are based on Islam . And in all the dialogues that he conveys he tries to show what a true Muslim thinks and believes in . The story revolves around Samir an explosives ' expert working with a terrorist group that exploits Muslim 's Faith for their interests . It flirts with the gray areas of Muslim Beliefs and tries to separate the black from white . An excellent film if Muslim Beliefs are seen through the eye of Samir . It however leaves a distaste regarding the ease with which suicide bombers are recruited from every walk of life , which is a bit difficult to believe . An excellent effort from Jaffery Nachmanoff .

" A modern thriller that gives a great perspective on the enemy . One thing in this movie really stood out to me , much unlike other spy\/espionage thrillers , and it 's the fact that this movie really captivates the lives of the terrorists in the middle east . Don cheadle does an excellent job acting , and though Guy Pierce was a bit lacking , the rest of the cast was very believable . And though you may think this movie does n't take this whole theme seriously because its PG-13 , think again . Traitor is actually very violent , but nowhere near graphic . In other words , it did n't need severed limbs and blood spurting everywhere , simply because it did n't need to . Action : 7\/10 Acting : 8\/10 Effects : 8\/10 Storyline : 9\/10 Overall score : 8\/10 " ,8
" Insight into Complex Characters . Most spy\/espionage\/terrorist films are so unrealistic as to be almost laughable albeit entertaining . The good guys are always totally good , and the bad guys are always totally bad , and no matter how much physical contact they have , they never show even as much as a bruise in the next scene . Traitor is not your typical film of this genre . The good guys are not all good , the bad guys are not all bad , and they bruise and bleed as do normal men . The film begins with a young Samir Horn witnessing the bombing death of his father . It is never known why his father was murdered but one assumes the motive was either political or religious . Time has passed and Samir has become a black market dealer in the Middle East . He is arrested and imprisoned with several members of a terrorist group . They escape , and Samir joins the group . Because he has lived in the United States for most of his life and speaks with no accent , he is chosen to be sent to the US to help organize a massive terrorist attack using suicide bombers - members of sleeper cells who have been embedded in the country for many years . Samir has come to the attention of the FBI , and the security community is attempting to track his movements . Viewers of Traitor are treated to a realistic and insightful look into the actions and personalities of all of the participants in this international conspiracy . One of the elements of this film that impressed me is that there are no duplicitous characters lurking in the background . There are spies that have worked themselves into all the organizations , but none is one of those cookie-cutter characters that show up so often in films of this ilk - the megalomaniac who performs acts of treachery due to his overblown opinion of himself . The superior acting and excellent script make Traitor a film to be thoroughly enjoyed and pondered . You actually have to think about the characters ' motives and actions in order to gain the full benefit of viewing . Don Cheadle as Samir the traitor , and Guy Pearce as the FBI agent searching for Samir are needless-to-say , first-rate in their portrays of two strong-willed and intelligent men . These two actors never give the audience less than sublime entertainment in any of their performances , and the ones in Traitor are no exceptions . They are mightily supported by a number of other excellent actors . Sa d Taghmaoui plays Omar who is Samir 's contact man amongst the terrorists . He shows us a man who would generally be painted as totally evil who is actually just a man dedicated to a cause in which he believes . There is also a rewarding understated performance by Neal McDonough as the assistant FBI agent . McDonough has lately fallen into the trap of playing a total nut case hiding behind a handsome face and those extraordinarily piercing eyes . He is a , somewhat , loose cannon in this film , but under control . It is a very good part for him . It seems more reasonable to classify Traitor as an exciting drama rather than an action flick . There is action , and the climatic scenes bring you to the edge of your seat - one a rewarding dose of very black humor . But it is the drama and insight into the complex characters that make Traitor a highly rewarding film . " ,10
" Excellent movie . As an Arab Muslim , I am mostly impressed at the effort that went into researching various verses in Quran , the understandable Arabic spoken by Mr. Cheadle , and the ` correct ' way that he did his prayers . I am used to people not praying correctly and putting in a show for the Camera . Mr. Cheadle was praying correctly . He has researched his role very well . The movie itself was excellent . The views presented of a more moderate Islam that abhors the violence on civilians and that does not support the more radical version is greatly appreciated . We are the silent majority . Well done to the team . AND thanks for a researched movie , and a balanced view . Thank You . " ,10
" It was in the eyes . For once I went to the theater with an open mind not knowing a thing about this movie . And being somewhat of a jaded fan of cinema , I was actually a bit surprised at the several plot twists in this story . However , thinking back Samir did look very pained and conflicted when interacting with the terrorists , executing the terrorist acts , etc etc. . Not gloating or triumphant , indeed he was on his knees in remorse . I should have known right then and there . I was impressed with this flick , a little edge on the seat and satisfied at the end . Cheadle and Pierce , Daniels , Taghmaoui , are fantastic , believable . Subtleties abound so you have to pay attention . Like I said , it 's in the eyes , and more . " ,9
" Good Post 9-11 Era Thriller . This film examines Islamo-Terrorism from Al - Qaeda 's perspective in a very interesting manner and without moral equivalence between US interests those of the terrorists . There is some US bashing on the part of the terrorists but it does n't crowd out or ruin the larger story . There are good guys bad guys , with shades of gray in between . Yet the story is a compelling one and Don Cheadle gives an Oscar worthy performance in the lead role as a terrorist\/traitor . He has a strong supporting cast , including Guy Peirce , as the lead FBI agent tracking him down , Neal McDonough -LRB- from HBO 's Band of Brothers '' -RRB- assisting Peirce , Jeff Daniels as an intelligence contractor with a shady persona , and many others , all excellent . The plot is complicated and I wo n't spend a lot of time re-hashing the movie . The movie begins in the 1970 's with the Don Cheadle character as a young boy in Sudan , fast forwards to present day Yemen , with Cheadle grown up and making a weapons sale to Al Qaeda -LRB- or the terrorist group , the film never explicitly mentions Al Qaeda -RRB- , and the location switches between Yemen , London , Paris , and Chicago . The main terrorist plot involves mass bombings in the US of passenger buses , all to be detonated at the same time , for maximum impact . This is definitely worth seeing . It 's a good action thriller that also provides some realistic international perspective sorely lacking in most of today 's spy movies . " ,8
" interesting . what a thought provoking movie , , it really makes you think about what is going on today in the Middle East , , Afghanistan , all of those places . Jihadists are a tricky bunch you do n't wan na make them mad , , apparently our main character Semir seemed to feel betrayed , and decided that he was gon na single handedly get back at all of those who had done him and his religion wrong for so many years , , interesting footage of a might be Jihadist might do in a terrorist situation , , like making a bomb for instance , , um the suicidal bomber , , stuff like that , , this movie is not so much into action as it is more of a political thriller type , , it shows the emotions of many of the jihadists and what they are going thru , , i 'm not sympathizing with them i 'm just saying some of it is interesting to see what happens from their point of view . " ,8
" Not So Bad . Not as political as I had imagined and expected , which is actually a relief considering the slew of preachy , self-righteous and pretentious politically-charged movies out there spawned since 9\/11 . Traitor is neither pretentious or preachy , it 's actually more akin to Hong Kong crime flick Infernal Affairs , where the police force has a mole and the triads also has a mole . Here , Don Cheadle 's ex-US Special Operations Officer is on a sting mission posing as an Islamic extremist to bring down a terrorist faction . All the while , Guy Pearce 's FBI agent is on his tail believing he 's really a terrorist . I 'm glad that the political preaching takes a back seat on this one , so that let 's the action and story move along at a good steady pace . " ,8

" Telling a story . The movie is trying to tell a story about the actors in this great performance called The War on Terror . It shows the true Muslim fighting for his religious beliefs , the zealot manipulated to die for some cause or the other , the people caught in the middle , the forces trying to stop terrorism and becoming more and more like their enemies . For this , I applaud the film . However , as a film , it was n't that great . It was technically well done , but the story was straight and predictable . All actors played very well , both Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce , yet I felt Sa d Taghmaoui was the star . An incredible small role from Jeff Daniels . Bottom line , the movie it is just a prop to a story . The story itself is simple and , I thought , too shallow . It is interesting , but not very real , in my opinion . Maybe because there are too many good guys in it :-RRB- " ,7
" TORTUOUS TRASH ; - 10 and Not Fahrenheit either . Based on the glitzy DVD jacket , I did n't see it coming : the disappointment Had I bothered to read the credits , I would have drop-kicked this one back to the bargain bin 's bottom . Writer : Steve Martin ? Are you kidding me ? Inspector Clousseau should have made a cameo . For certain , this oh so dreary spy\/political film was in dire need of comedic moments . EG . How about a word from the disgraced Inspector . Hello , my friend the internet . Speaking of comedy , why 'd they include Jeff Daniels ? He of little or no faith added nothing to the already convoluted , Ahem , plot . A good ` bad ' example . When he and Cheadle tried to disguise their clandestine meeting after a crazed terrorist ` friend ' showed up -LRB- unannounced -RRB- I half expected Harry to blurt out what he does best . I 'm shaving ! BANG ! BANG ! One and Dunn . Dead . Gone ! Even his designer threads could not belie this mistake in casting . And it showed . Jeff , even stood out . In the rain . Fake though it was . I 'll back it up a bit ... This film lacks substance . And a plot . And some good intelligent subterfuge . But what it lacked in substance it more than made up for in horrible acting . Don Cheadle , as the lead character , Samir Horn , the American Muslim-come-lately but always high on Koran quotations is unconvincing . To wit , we do n't know who Samir is-was-or his wannabees . For hours Cheadle 's expression is rigid ; speech is stunted ; his interaction -LRB- other than a few clumsily staged karate chop-chop scenes -RRB- with the other characters both baddies and goodies is bizarre . Same case can be made for the pursuers : the FBI . Guy Pearce as ` good cop ' Roy Clayton is a study in twisted logic . Not the J. Edgar type we have grown accustomed to . Other than a constant grimace and an over pierced U.S. Southern accent , Pearce , like the film , looks tortured for the most part . Acts like it too . Make that all the time . Ditto . For his partner in anti-terrorism , Max Archer -LRB- here we go again with those fake designer labels -RRB- played by ex-Hawaii 5-0 cop , Dano . Er , make that Neil McDonough . In appearance , the whole FBI anti-terrorism central command skits are knock-offs and really sound like episodes from CNN 's Wolf Blitzer 's ` Situation Room ' . Martin , perhaps should have wrote this horrible script for the fake newscasters instead . Sans the comedy ... Moreover , the Muslim terrorists are equally bad-good-inept . Depending on which verse of the Koran is quoted . Even Pearce gets into the act . He , of deft\/daft intellect is so quick to wipe the crime slate clean ; for any heinous deed , including murder . In his defense Guy growls : The Koran says so . So did my Baptist Minister daddy . Guess this line was necessary . To create religious tension . So far , the marauding Crusaders of yore are spared blamed . That title is reserved for America . All of its people . No one is spared . Then a toast . The terrorists raise their champagne glasses . But not to Allah . Unless the flutes are without alcohol . Righttt ... And chief terrorist , bottle-washer and bag-man , Nathir , played by Raad Rawi , who likes to hold mens ' hands in tightwad prayer circles comes across , well , like TV 's Monk . Looks like Tony too ! Hard for me to find a bright spot . There were some glimpses . Fleeting though . Those came in the form of Mozhan Marno , as ` Leyla ' . Including the classic rock song may have pushed Martin 's I 'm - to-be-taken serious boundaries . Seriously , where were those ? Time for one more , memorable but deplorable designer moment . Another fake name . Maybe straight out of People Magazine : Archie Panjabi , as , Chandra Dawkin . No doubt about this one : another fake and useless character inclusion . Wo n't torture you anymore . Do yourself a favor . Do n't rent or buy this foible of a film . That was really all about horse chit . And dumb chatter . Except for Harry Dunn . Jeff 's only real , believable character . " ,1
" A Nutshell Review : Traitor . It sure took a long time for this film to debut here , and if memory serves me right , it took almost a year , and the DVD has already been released . If not for a press screening already held , I would have thought that the film would be one of those that are difficult to pass by the censors and required some lengthy debate as to the merits for its theatrical release . That 's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner , with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists ' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom , Syriana , The Siege and Body of Lies , to name but a few films dealing with the topic . I am a keen admirer of Don Cheadle 's film performance , especially in dramatic roles , and here he plays Samir Horn , a devout Muslim and US citizen caught up in a web of intrigue and international terrorism acts . We see how he employs his skills of bomb-making , honed from his US Special Operations days as an officer , and seemingly looks like a rogue , US domestic terrorist aiding foreign groups in their operations to harm the world . But there 's more than meets the eye to Samir , and here 's where Cheadle excels in putting that level of ambiguity into a role that raises moral questions about doing something for the greater good , no matter the costs . Chasing him around the world are FBI counter-terrorism agents Roy Clayton -LRB- Guy Pearce -RRB- and Max Archer -LRB- Neal McDonough -RRB- , who are clearly like fish out of water when operating outside their legal jurisdictions . Unfortunately for the two actors , their roles here as the downright good guys are always a step or two behind the terrorist cells , which in some ways mirror that in real life . Without good intelligence , you 're always reactive , and it takes a lot to be on top of the game , especially when tactics employed are normally innovately discharged . We get to see a number of no-brainer tactics that the cells employ which are effective if you think about it , which makes it all the more dangerous should they be used because they actually can be . But the most dangerous game to be playing from the side of the good guys , is the refusal to share intelligence or to combine resource , drawing lines in the sand and setting up turfs . The bickering between agencies all point to missing out on the bigger picture on one hand , while on the other the need for confidentiality also brings up operational sensitivity in order not to jeopardize any current missions , and this need to know service also stems from being overly cautious of any internal moles that would betray efforts in progress . In some ways , this is like Infernal Affairs being played all over again . I suppose that without the balanced view and very verbatim statements made toward the end renouncing violence and misguided teachings , this film would probably not be given the green light . But it did , and presented a very though provoking thinking man 's action thriller set in this age of cloak and dagger terrorism . Sure it has some loopholes and the unnecessary -LRB- and unavoidable -RRB- collateral damage , but watch this for the performance all round and an engaging storyline that might not keep you guessing all the way once the cat is out of the bag , but does enough . " ,8
" He 's a traitor ... but to whom ? Or what ? . Samir Horn -LRB- Don Cheadle , awesome as always -RRB- is on the run . Perpetually . He 's an American ex-pat who has joined various groups of small cells of Islamic activists who are `` taking it to '' the West in various sorts of bombings and attacks . He has some reason : raised Muslim and having watched his peaceful father die in a car attack , his faith and apparent disillusion with Wester morality and values has caused him to decide to fight for a cause . Or has he ? As it turns out , no ... or at least not really . This film , conceived of by of all people actor\/comedian Steve MArtin -LRB- ! -RRB- and directed by Jeffrey NAchbarr , is a fast , unrelenting tale of pursuit as Horn 's true nature and his own missions are being tracked by two dogged Feds -LRB- Guy Pearce is Clayton , the perceivable `` good cop '' and Neal McDonough is MAx , the `` bad cop '' -RRB- and is being kept up to speed by a high-to-low level CIA spook -LRB- Jeff Daniels , in what 's a little bit more than a cameo -RRB- . Some great support offered by SAid Taghmouri -LRB- as Cheadle 's comrade in arms and impressionable prot g -RRB- and Archie Punjabi -LRB- as Samir 's old flame -RRB- are able to put substance behind what could 've just as easily been turned into another post-9 \/ 11 chase-and-catch terrorism story , a sort of lighter shade of yet another theme movie and\/or episode of `` 24 '' . But this show is made just competent and intelligently enough to keep it interesting and mostly true . Maybe not as sincerely intelligent enough to be a great movie of its genre , it still makes the rent\/ticket price worth purchase . " ,8
" A very excellent twist on the usual terrorism movies . Don Cheadle is a former Army man and a devout Muslim who is now living in the Middle East , selling weapons to the highest bidders . Then he gets caught up in a counterterrorist raid and is thrown into prison -LRB- even though he never actively participated in any terrorist acts -RRB- . Cheadle gets out with the help of some actual terrorists and decides to help them . He begins to build bombs and train suicide bombers in future attacks . Meanwhile , Guy Pearce is an FBI agent searching for answers to the elusive Cheadle 's suspicious activities and the questions Pearce has are `` Is Cheadle a dyed in the wool terrorist ? If so , where will he strike next ? '' If you 're looking for a film that is like 24 -LRB- where Jack Bauer runs in and kills all of the terrorists in 24 hours -RRB- , you 're looking in the wrong place . This is more along the lines of Syriana or Body of Lies -LRB- where nothing is cut and dried -RRB- . Most of Traitor is from the perspective of the terrorists , instead of the counterterrorists . This move by the producers was very gutsy and unique . Second , the notions of Islam ranges from the fundamentalists to the moderates to the hypocrites . Islam is n't painted with a wide brush , and every Middle Eastern is not a terrorist . Even agencies of the US government in Traitor have different agendas , and are all jockeying for their piece of the pie instead of fighting terrorists in a coordinated fashion . There are some plot holes and confusion , but Traitor gives a lot for you to think on . It deserves a watch , at the least . Cheadle is the heart and soul of this film , and helps to carry it along masterfully . " ,8
" Not bad considering ... . This was a different spin on your typical contemporary film dealing with terrorism . Don Cheadle plays a character dealing with internal conflict after the death of his father from a terrorist blast . Throughout the movie the audience is left guessing which side he is truly on . Of course , it does n't take a genius to figure this out but the creative idea driving the film and the protagonist 's motivation to act puts a new spin on contemporary films dealing with the same subject matter . For example , Body of Lies was boring because it offered nothing new to audiences . I credit traitor for offering me at least this much . I wo n't spoil the ending for viewers , but I think most people will `` spot it a mile away . '' The climatic ending works for this type of film , but not sure it succeeded in allowing me to `` willingly suspend my disbelief . ' " ,7
" A film that keeps you guessing . I never saw any trailers for this movie that I can recall but rented it on someone 's comments as well as for the lead actors in the movie who I 've seen in others movies and thoroughly enjoyed . This film keeps you intrigued all the way through and waiting to find out how things will play out . There are many things the writer and director bring to the screen that have you wondering how real this could be in our current day and time . Goofs : During the end of the film they fly to Halifax , Nova Scotia to stop a ship with our bad guys on it but in the next scene you see the good guys get into a dingy and steer out to sea but in the distance is the Hamilton , ON Skyway bridge ... oops ! " ,8
" Far-fetched awesome and here 's why . I start with the ending , so major spoiler warning - ---------- You have to admit that the idea of 30 sleeper-suicide-bombers duped into boarding the same bus has a funny side to it . But it probably would not occur to you till way after the credits roll . Steve Martin had to contend with all the usual trappings such movies inevitably run up against , and he handles them decently , but in doing so he had to sacrifice some of the reality he attempts to portray . Here 's a partial reality-checklist ; 1 . Sleepers awaiting their suicide-mission is ludicrous . The indoctrination is intense , the brainwashing is constant and up to the last minute , the candidates fit a certain profile and they would not function in normal society for a week , let alone for years on end . Albeit , the ` threat ' must be insidious , exceed our expectations in some novel way and as such it 's a passable premise . 2 . The idea of a ` leak ' within the agency is preposterous , we 're well aware of lie-detectors , background checks , screening , etc. . On the other hand , they have no choice but to level the playing field , the suspense\/buildup would fizzle out were it to remain in first gear . 3 . The obvious solution for Samir -LRB- Cheadle -RRB- would have been to neutralize \* all \* the bombs , having ample opportunities on his ` infidel-express ' delivery route . Sure , that would have been anticipated and as such , anti-climatic , although it could have led to some great aftermath scenes of passengers tackling these individuals down . Likewise , some of the bombs did not go off , otherwise we would need to be told the sleepers were all on the same bus . Again , it could have played almost the same if at the last minute the camera traveled up the aisle , disclosing the plot-twist , yet here again , the bombers would have died in the bliss of their ignorance , much to our dissatisfaction . 4 . Upon being apprehended Samir had no reason to pursue his ` role ' , the sham is tempered with a punch to the stomach , a weak one I 'd say . 5 . The computer-generated model of the second mastermind was just laughable , the idea being that some cutting-edge software is piecing together a composite so that once it completes the 3D render , they can close in on him , please ... I guess it plays OK as a visual device , till you think about it . Fighting fanaticism with fanaticism is one way to sum up this movie , while the moral may just be that you should n't . Either way , the globe-trotting scene-settings and the overall feel and snippets of the dialogue were first-class , I saw someone dub it the intellectual 's Bourne , which is funny , considering how Ludlum 's Bourne was deemed a cut above the spy novels of its time . We 've grown too savvy for our own entertainment needs -LRB- sigh -RRB- ... " ,8
" Detailed , precise , but too much to handle for most myopics . I always find it amusing when religious groups will tell you that they find something offensive because their religion is 99.9 % good and it is only the .1 % of people who do bad things . They will tell you that said film is biased , despicable and inflammatory . The absolute worst , in my opinion , is Catholics , but Muslims are doing their best to catch up now . I think we will all agree , apodictally , that Muslims do blow themselves up in the name of Allah and why people find films about this to be offensive is something made for comedy . Traitor is a film that shows deceit , religious fanaticism , zealotry and jingoism at it 's worst . Is all of this possible ? Does everything the film show up really seem feasible ? To me , it is not only feasible , it is probably more accurate that most are willing to believe . Traitor tells the story of an American Muslim , born in Syria , as he rises in the ranks of religious loonies as they plan to blow up the world , literally . The film takes us to Spain , Syria , Canada , The United States , and The U.K. . This is like The Bourne films , you feel like you have just been around the world once the credits roll . This reminds us that terrorism is everywhere . The very idea of terrorism is to destroy life as we know it and create anarchy . To do this , these people stake their claim in all industrialized nations . This was one of the best parts of the film . You never know what is being discussed in some downtown Toronto pub or bakery or some small town fishing community . The genesis of their plans begin inauspiciously right under our noses and you never know where it 's coming from . Don Cheadle is fantastic as Samir Horn , our clandestine hero or anti-hero . His true intentions are kept secret throughout the film . He is relentlessly pursued by two FBI agents , one empathetic to him , one downright thuggish . Guy Pearce plays Roy Clayton , the FBI agent on his trail , but has his questions about the motive behind Samir 's actions . He is always one step behind Samir , but like Deputy Girard in the Fugitive , he begins piecing things together and will eventually solve the puzzle . Guy Pierce gives another stellar performance . Traitor is a fascinating study of religious fanaticism , government lies and innuendo and how far a nation will go to ostensibly protect itself and it 's citizens from the supposed terrorists that are plotting their next fiasco as you read this . And it begs all kinds of questions , the most important being , what is right and what is wrong in the name of national security . You hear stories all the time of men being held at Guantanamo Bay who have not been charged but are not allowed to leave . You hear stories of torture and other atrocities . To most , those are just words . But to the victims , torture and wrongful imprisonment is a life of hell . Traitor has the insight to examine the implications of these acts . Eventually , the bully will be taken down . All it takes is 4 or 5 of his victims to ban together and fight him . America is perceived by most as the bully . Traitor is an interesting film with much to say . Judging by many of the reviews here , most do n't like hearing or seeing what it has to say . And that 's too bad . This film wo n't solve the worlds problems , but it will certainly shed some light on them . 8.5 \/ 10 " ,9
" Good not great , but horribly advertised . I just saw Traitor today and was pleasantly surprised with what I saw . I was sort of expecting Hollywood to try and turn Don Cheatle into Jason Bourne 2.0 , but found him to be almost nothing like Bourne , and loving that about him . This movie is all about faith , and how some people in this world use faith to help themselves lead a better life , and some use other people 's faith to manipulate them . It is also a movie that , like crash , finally shows that not all Islamic people are suicide bombing terrorists . The supporting cast was solid , not the best , but still did the job well enough . The cinematography was likewise adequite . I only give it a 7 because , while it was entertaining and worth paying to seeing , and Cheatle has moved up another peg in my list of great actors . " ,7
" Quite Original a Vessel in a Sea of Crap ! . I must say I NEVER give tens when I review movies , but this was one of the more original and interesting movies in the last couple of years . It does leave you guessing and wondering a bit throughout the ride , but that is half the fun . As usual , Don Cheadle brings it , and why are the STUDIO 'S not promoting this film ... ... . . especially with all the crap they have promoted this year alone . Guy Pierce is a nice back up on this and certainly Jeff Daniels is good at what he brings , but the true fun is kind of seeing things from both sides , not very much bashing of Muslims or Americans , just a good story with some thoughts on both sides . Give this a chance and I bet you will be pleasantly surprised . " ,10
" Martin hits a triple , but his home run curves foul ! . I enjoyed this movie . It was about a subject I have great interest in , and some knowledge about . So I was pleased to see Steve Martin et al give it a decent shot . He takes the TV show `` Sleeper Cell '' and adds some intelligence and expands on the education about the difference between Jihadis and good Muslims - a distinction many Americans have n't made yet ! Don Cheadle plays an American of Sudanese origin caught up with terrorists in Yemen who get captured , and who turns down a proffered `` free get out of jail card '' by counter terrorist FBI agents -LRB- played with nice tautness by Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough - who finally gets decent air time -RRB- , opting instead to share a prison in Yemen with a jihadi cell . Can you guess why ? Yup , anybody who knows these kinds of movies does , but Martin 's story does give a decent attempt to throw us off track , but he ca n't fool us fans who know these tricks . It ends up being a warmish Le Carre type thriller , but falls short in the believability part at the end . There is the point counter point of `` sleeper cell '' and it takes more risks than that formulaic show , but in the end it pulls it 's punches , and unfortunately puts in some ludicrous plot twisters to wrench it away from the much more likely , and to me much more satisfying , ending . Cheadle is a decent enough actor , brave in going after the movies that have a message , but his range is limited and he never seems comfortable enough when he 's serious giving off a flat affect that reduces his aura . Pearce is the most interesting as a decent `` religious '' FBI agent who acts as counterpart to Cheadle 's `` religious '' double agent . But the guy I like the most is Sa d Taghmaoui , by now a recognized journeyman of these kinds of movies , whose tough guy persona fits well with our stereotype of a jihadi , but who 's allowed here to expand the type with some depth . \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* SPOLIERS \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 1 .

" A very good movie ... I just watched it at an unfortunate time . . TRAITOR I really enjoyed it . Again , this is one of those movies that I had never heard of but saw the DVD cheap and thought I would try it . It 's about a terrorist group who are planning to bomb America . Don Cheadle is a terrorist that is planting these bombs ... Guy Pearce is an FBI agent tracking him . It is a good chase film ... Don is running and hiding , but Guy is right behind him the whole way ... he just ca n't seem to catch him . The acting was good and the story was really good . There were a few surprising moments in the movie and a couple of really good twists . It was really bad timing to watch this movie though ... after this film finished I turned on the news and heard that there really was a bombing in America . 2 bombs went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon . at least 8 people confirmed dead so far , including an 8 year old child . It is such a shame that things like this happen in real life . It makes a great movie story like in Traitor , but it is a sad day when terrorism happens and kills innocent people . My thoughts go out to the people effected by this attack . I give this film 7 out of 10 . It 's a very entertaining movie and was surprisingly not very well known ... it should have done better in the box office .

" Brawn and Brains combo thriller . This is a good take on Muslim Terrorism . The story is multilayer-ed , things move fast enough but not at frantic pace . . Don Cheadle and Guy give excellent account of themselves . . This is a straight up front James Bond type movie , but a brainy thriller , quite satisfying with twist in the climactic scenes .

" Compelling and Convincing Terrorist Thriller . The ever-watchable Don Cheadle , who has turned in so many fine performances , here does it again , though he slightly overdoes the conscience-stricken angst -LRB- an emotion he has not yet learned to portray convincingly enough , perhaps because in real life he has not done anything bad enough to regret it sufficiently -RRB- . This is a step by step depiction of infiltration into a Qaida terrorist cell at a very high level indeed . The film was written and directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff , who clearly has considerable talent . The film is uniformly exciting , nail-biting , and fascinating . For most of the film we do not know whether Cheadle is an infiltrator or a terrorist . Some of the Arabs in the film do excellent jobs of acting , though it is a bit difficult to keep them straight , especially in retrospect . The one who really stands out is Said Taghmaoui , who was born in France of Moroccan ancestry . He plays the intense character named Omar , whom Cheadle genuinely befriends . " ,9
" Simply not good . Don Cheadle is a great actor . He manages to make any movie gold . Unfortunately , he has no control over Traitor , a cheaply made , sometimes thrilling , kind of sort of good thriller about terrorists . Don Cheadle stars as Samir Horn , a man who helps terrorists by selling them bombs . As the title suggests , he soon becomes a traitor , now telling government agents about all his terrorist customer 's plans . So now , he is being hunted down by terrorists and government workers alike . The movie , overall provides a couple of cheap thrills , but that does n't in any way , shape , or form make it work . It is simply not a good movie , it 's just not thrilling , smart , or original . It portrays all Muslims as terrorists , something that makes the movie simply not respectable . There is no possible redeeming value in this film . It 's a thriller without the smarts or thrills that it needed . I have to admit , as always , Don Cheadle is fantastic , but this may be his only movie in which he does not have control over how good or bad the movie is . It 's not terrible , it 's just simply not very good , and therefore I can not see myself ever recommending it . " ,4
" A good movie . . . I saw this movie with my multicultural friends , All of us liked it . Its not racist , its not at all about just America but its is about the truth . The misconception 's in people mind , about religion and faith , this is a perfect portrait of it . Don plays an amazing role , with just the perfect acting you can see anywhere , he plays the hero and for a time the villain . And let me tell you something , he is very convincing . There are many movies with a similar plot , but this one also has a twist , an heroic twist , which makes the whole movie worthwhile . People need to watch this movie , and watch with a open mind , watch it to see the truth about the world and to break the bubble created by today 's images arround you . Someone once said , religion is flawed because man is flawed , this movie and Don gives you an example for it . I recommend this movie to everyone and specially to misguided people , please watch this . " ,9
" The movie is good , the message is powerful . Traitor is a good movie , the action and the plot are not really different from other thriller\/action movies , but this movie stands out of the crowd for one reason : it shows that terrorism and Islam are two different things . Terrorism is actually the biggest enemy of Islam , because its concept contradicts the main principles of this religion , as one of the main characters says ; and even though this movie is not an unforgettable movie , it sends an important message : terrorism is not a Muslim thing , it is an extremist Islamic thing . Traitor can help people rethink their view on Islam . About the movie in itself , I 'd say that the actors are good , the plot is OK , and the action , if not outstanding , is good enough to enjoy . watch , it is worth it . " ,8
" Good Acting , Decent Suspense and Locales . I think you 'd be hard pressed not to deny the talent and likability of Don Cheadle . He 's made the jump from supporting to lead actor seamlessly . In Traitor with Cheadle and Guy Pierce as the leads we have first rate acting and pretty good direction . And Said Taghmaoui brings in some solid support . Cinematography is well done and not too jerky with some range of coloring and hues - and an exceptional range of locales . Most interesting though may be the developing friendship and dialog between Omar -LRB- Taghmaoui -RRB- and Samir -LRB- Cheadle -RRB- including some good philosophical and religious banter . And there 's some steps up including using on location languages paying more attention to details . One quib , despite it 's intricacies and intentions , I did get the feeling the movie was propagating stereotypes of evil Muslim Arabs and deluded followers which I 'm sure the world has . But this movie felt like it was sand-boxing the topic somewhat . It 's a good suspense movie probably worth a watch . " ,7
" Hollywood tries to be objective and realistic about Islam , but not even close ! . How do Americans see Muslims ? As they are in the cinema . What Hollywood shows as a Muslim is an image of a dirty body in `` a Muslim suit '' , messy hair and beard with `` turban '' , and `` a gun in the hand '' , ready to explode ! If you watch `` The Message '' , you may see what a Muslim is and how he\/she should be , but if you see a Muslim in any Hollywood comedy movie , you will see what a Muslim is not and should not be . Movies about Gulf War , Iraq War , Afghanistan War or Al Qaeda - as if Al Qaeda represents Islam - make an image of Islam which is not true , which was never true and which will not be true . If you want to know anything about Islam , just read a translation of Quran , do not watch those . Hollywood knows nothing about Islam ! Have you ever watched a Muslim praying -LRB- salat -RRB- ? Even in a movie like `` Kingdom of Heaven '' , there is no relation between what they show as praying and a real praying ! Do you know Muslims believe in Jesus and Moses , Adam , Noah , David , and call them all as prophets ? Do you know Muslims believe in St. -LRB- Virgin -RRB- Mary ? You do not -LRB- ? -RRB- , because they do not want you to know , and they do not want to know MORE ! What `` Traitor '' does ? Every Muslim is not bad , they may like America -LRB- If you do not like America , then you are a bad guy ! -RRB- . The ones who bombs us are not real Muslims . Yes , they are not Muslims , but is Samir Horn doing the right thing ? Maybe it is okay . However , any Muslim watching this movie can see that Americans still knows too little about Muslims . The movie is very poor for showing the life of a Muslim , the philosophy of a Muslim . Islam is everywhere in the life , every part in the life of a Muslim , both mentally and physically . Islam shows a Muslim , how to think , eat , sleep , walk , have a haircut , wash , marry , raise children , cook , talk , write ... Everything has an Islamic way . Unfortunately , Hollywood is not even close to show that satisfactorily . `` Factual errors : At the start of the movie , Samir is praying on the left side of his father . He should be praying on the right . '' says IMDb ! Which Muslim told you such a rule ? It is not a rule , but it is better to do it . It reminded me the beginning scene of the movie `` Eagle Eye '' about the Muslim ceremony and the five principles of Islam , there is NO such thing in Islam . Do they think they give a fantastic or mystic atmosphere !? At the end of Traitor Samir says `` We say Assalam Alaikum at the beginning of a conversation , not at the end . '' Wrong ! Muslims says that both at the end and at the beginning ! PLEASE Hollywood , PLEASE FIND AN INTELLECTUAL Muslim , BEFORE MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT THEM ! Traitor is a step , I think . Comparatively IT IS PERFECT ! If you want to learn something about Islam , read Quran ! If you want a movie about Islam , just watch THE MESSAGE -LRB- 1976 -RRB- . Watch especially the last ten minutes ... Thank you for reading ! . . " ,7
" Good storytelling and photography . After having seen Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda I was blown away about his performance . When I heard Don 's in this one I took the chance to watch the movie . Well first of all , I 'm very glad they did n't distort the story to a superhero agent thing . This one has a very different approach to a sensitive subject . What I liked the most was the storytelling which shows both sides motivations . Once again Don Cheadle convinced me what strong character actor he really is . Guy Pearce plays his part very realistic , since as above mentioned he 's no super agent who can handle everything with ease . I think after having watched this movie a lot of people will get a closer look to complicated religiously driven policy convictions . I also think Jeffrey Nachmanoff did a fantastic job with his style since I think the movie has a splendid photography . " ,8
" Decent Espionage Thriller with a couple glitches ... . Overall this film is good as it shows positive moral fiber . The movie is likable as a plot twisted story but not necessarily as an action movie . Suspense here is plentiful . How is it , like in many of these movies , is it just an agent or two traveling practically the world to find a suspect ? Usually Just like Bourne , and Hit-man , but not too shabby a movie . Don Cheadle 's acting seemed pretty deep in his performance and in real life he could have convinced anyone in real life about who he was at that given time . Here is a glitch I have to mention-That scene where Samir was talking to his ex in the parked while under surveillance of the Feds . The Fed 's call up Guy Pearce while he 's a mile high in an airplane to notify Samir 's in the park . As Samir leaves the park , the Feds are chasing him and here 's Guy Pearce apparently already landed and off the airplane and out of the airport . Guy Pearce apparently is so quick to get off a plane in the air and Chasing Don Cheadle into a project block in a matter of a few minutes . Whoops-I guess directing should have thought of that . No big deal . But the acting is solid and the plot twists are entertaining enough to almost want to watch again . Put em ' on the same bus . That was quite clever . " ,8
" A reason to go to movies again ... finally . . Cheadle can do anything -LRB- comedy , drama , thriller , action -RRB- . His portrayal in Hotel Rwanda was stunning but he owns this role and does not for one minute leave the audience wondering about authenticity . Traitor grabs you from the first minutes of the film and lets go half way through the credits when you ask to rewind and see if it was really Steve Martin the comic legend that wrote the film . This film is what movies used to be and should be again ; smart , creative and a character driven story . Sadly as I left the theater there was two camps . Those who got it and those who have been spoon fed from movies that they simply miss the message and the genius . Several Oscars should be awarded to Traitor . First to Don Cheadle for best actor !

" Traitor deals with the war against terror that will make you think . -LRB- Synopsis -RRB- Samir Horn -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- , a devout American Muslim , and a former U.S. Army Special Forces expert in explosives , has been mysteriously showing up on the FBI 's radar for being in the area of terrorist bombings . FBI agent Roy Clayton -LRB- Guy Pearce -RRB- heads up a task force investigation to link Horn to these bombings . Clayton is able to question Horn after he was arrested in Yemen for attempting to sell explosives to an Islamic terrorist group . The terrorists break out of prison and take Horn with them . With the help of Max Archer -LRB- Neal McDonough -RRB- , Clayton is able to link Horn to a bombing of an American Consulate in Nice , and a failed police raid to capture his top terrorist contact in London . Clayton has been pursuing Horn around the world and has tracked him to the United States . Clayton must capture Horn before he strikes his next target . -LRB- My Comment -RRB- Traitor is a movie that deals with the war against terror and will make you think . Traitor focuses more on the personal relationships rather than an action flick . The story is about faith and how some people use faith to help themselves to lead a better life , and how some people highjack other people 's faith to manipulate them . They are the thinkers and planners and of course not the suicide bombers . The movie has suspense , drama , and several twists and turns . Don Cheadle 's performance was deep and electrifying , which made the movie . Guy Pierce and Said Taghmaoui also did nice acting jobs . I loved the final twist of the movie , because I did not see it coming . -LRB- Overture Films , Run Time 1:54 , Rated PG-13 -RRB- -LRB- 7\/10 -RRB- " ,7
" Cheadle excels in this knotty global imbroglio . TRAITOR -LRB- 2008 -RRB- \*\*\* Don Cheadle , Guy Pearce , Siad Taghmaoui , Neal McDonough , Jeff Daniels , Aly Khan , Archie Panjabi . Cheadle rises above the tricky storyline about a devout Muslim American who is caught between loyalty to his religion and his country when he is accused of terrorism in light of his affiliation as a government agent with some twists and turns of the screw in this potboiler of globe-trotting intrigue . The screenplay by novice director Jeffrey Nachmanoff suggested by a story by none other than funnyman Steve Martin -LRB- ! -RRB- is somewhat knotty and a tad too preachy but overall brings some fresh perspective to the current world climate and has a `` Bourne '' appeal of an everyman in a nightmarish existence .

" a review from an Arab Muslim . No one can deny that yes there is a bunch of terrorists who are Muslims , so I 'm not going to attach the movie , just because it brings these bad muslims to light , since directing a movie about normal muslims will be very boring . But come on , the only good Muslim is an American ! Also there are some mistakes that have a huge impact on the image of Muslims like the explainiasion of Takia ... In the film there is a scene were muslims were drinking alcohol , and they execuse there acts with a speech for prophet Mohammad saying that it 's OK to lie , to create a deception to enemies ... Well , this is not true , and Takia as well , is not a Sunni law , it 's just in the Shia law . I 'm mentioning that because such an idea will make us hypocrites . Hollywood loves to show that there is always a bloody spiritual war in the Middle East , I 'm form the heart of the Middle East , Go and google Jordan it comes in the middle between Iraq and Israel ... yeah imagine that . And it 's totally peacefull place the only two war zones are in Israel and Iraq , there is no terrorists in any other country , I never saw a gun before and most of people here are the same , and this movie and some other movies are showing that we have daily explosions , and terrorists are living between us . Why I 'm saying this , because this movie is giving the idea that terrorists are well-organized and smart ! Whatever you think , forget it , it 's the most over-rated idea in the modern history . That 's why I gave a low rating for this movie , because the director watched Fox News and CNN then he built the whole idea . Next time , try to at least visit the Middle East . " ,1
" A thinking man 's spy thriller . . Unlike many spy thrillers that bombard the audience with senseless violence and one-sided good vs evil , `` Traitor '' is the best of them all . The real standout is Don Cheadle , great as the main character and his performance shows that he can do great action too with potential in more roles in the action genre . Guy Pearce is also good as FBI agent Roy Clayton with a hard , somewhat cynical edge whose determined to get the job done no matter what the odds . Also worth mentioning is Sa d Taghmaoui whose role really shines as the bad guy whose comradeship between him and Cheadle leads to a tragic end . Overall , a great spy thriller . There 's action but not too much that detracts from the focus of the story and for once more importantly , it does n't fall into typical Hollywood bravado that 's so prevalent in today 's movies and instead presents both sides of the argument and leaves the viewer with a bunch of questions . One of the best spy thrillers I 've seen this year . 4 out of 5 stars . Great film . " ,8
" The finest movie about spies and terrorism yet . . The movie starts by introducing us to Cheadle 's character Horn , who as a Muslim child witnesses a relative die in a car bomb explosion in Sudan where he was born . Next we encounter him as an adult about to make a deal to sell explosives in Yemen to a terrorist friend . But first he has to go through a suspicious middleman named Omar . Suddenly the police raid the home and Omar and Horn are detained while others die . They are taking to a jail where Horn is interrogated by FBI agents played by Pierce and McDonough . Horn has an American passport and the agents think it will be easy to get him to cooperate . Horn rejects the offer . While in jail his devotion to Islam gets the attention of Omar , who during an escape takes Horn with him . They end up in France , where Horn gets deeper into terrorist activities , changing from more of a brainy guy to an actual soldier in Jihad . Little by little as he shows his commitment to war against the Americans , he displays his loyalty by getting involved in bombings against a US consulate and gets introduced to some of the higher figures in the terrorist organization . Although Horn remains always slightly reluctant because those pulling the strings are quick to dismiss the principles of Islam for their war . His next mission is a major attack on the US . 50 simultaneous bombings of buses traveling across America . Eventually we find out the Horn works for the US . His handler , played by Daniels , has kept his identity secret in the entire US security apparatus , hence the FBI still going after him . But financial transactions alert the FBI that something major is about to happen . The FBI nearly catches Horn , but in a confrontation with Pierce , Horn lets him live . I wo n't reveal how the ending plays out but a lot involves the internal struggle of Horn trying to balance his mission , his cover , and his commitment to his religion . This is a somewhat difficult movie if you 're a firm believer in the idea that the US is the good righteous country spreading blessings around the globe while all those who oppose us are evil . The terrorists are given a voice here and are allowed to make arguments to explain their actions . Some hard things are said about how America operates . The aim is not to defend terrorism but to point out the irreligiosity of all violence while often political discourse is framed in religious terms . A very provocative idea is that those pulling the strings in terrorist organizations are not pious Muslims but rather secular businessmen , who stopped submitting to god and chose to submit to hate . They turned from an interior jihad against temptation to an external jihad against the infidels . Meanwhile Horn is not willing to make such a shift . His interpretation of Islam puts his interior relation to god above any earthly goals . The production of this movie is excellent : the look , the sounds , the music . The cast does an outstanding job . The underused Guy Pierce shines here as well as some of the actors who play the terrorists . The script and direction are superb - seamlessly mixing intrigue , action and smart dialogue . This is a thinking man 's international spy thriller with enough action to keep our senses entertained as well as deep philosophical musings to engage the mind - probably due to the involvement of philosophy graduate Steve Martin . It also stays away from cheap clich s , like some revelatory moment of the FBI that Horn is on the US side - they are not sure until the very end . Movie goers will leave this theater satisfied and entertained . " ,10
" good performance by Don Cheadle . I have kind of mixed emotions about this thriller . On the one hand the story is very muddled and not very believable , especially how the FBI allows him to do what he does . On the other hand , Don Cheadle is a very strong actor who gets you to care for him to a certain degree . He 's very believable and that 's a real feat in a film like this which could otherwise just be a TV show . He kicks the film up a notch to a better area . All in all there 's some good suspense in `` Traitor '' . The scenes in middle east were pretty well done and convincing . The main issue I had with the movie was later when we get a bad and very predictable twist that Cheadle works for a solo agent and no one knows about their secret work . Although I did n't buy that , the best moment of the film was still when Cheadle has to pretend the agent was trying to attack him , so as not to blow his own cover . That was really good . Other than that , worth a watch just for Don Cheadle 's performance and a few story twists . " ,3
" Top Notch . I saw this movie during the weekend . Did n't have a clue what the storyline was . We see one of Hollywood 's most under rated actors in my opinion . Don Cheadle is cold , he is calm and somehow you feel sorry for his character like Leonardo in Departed . I like Said 's character Samir as well . I saw him in Vantage Point and was n't impressed at all but here he has a bigger role and more to do as far as the movie goes . This is a definite Sarturday night DVD movie with enough action and excitement . I must say I was a bit disappointed the way it ended ; I thought they could have done a little more to tell us what happens to Don 's character ... However all round i think it was a brilliant movie . " ,9
" A real delight to watch . I want to start off simple ... keeping in mind the way all blockbusters are made today - predictable and plot less . Well , for starters , this movie offers high level of predictability . When you watch you will not be surprised , you will not jump off your seat . Terrorists , FBI , double agents , the ONLY person that know the truth dies ... And here comes the great `` but '' ! But everything is so natural . While watching the movie you start realizing that the movies made today still have something to offer . The acting is pretty good , the script is n't anything that we have n't seen , but the directing , the whole feel that the movies leaves you with , is priceless . Everything is made so real , as if this could really happen . The main aspect of the movie is concentrating on the most important part - the faith . The faith of the people believing in something greater than themselves . While watching the movie you start realizing what it is like to really believe in something , no matter how universally wrong it might be . The whole supporting cast is great - at a certain point you are caught in the twirl of the decisiveness and determination of the terrorists . I am from Bulgaria and I could go on and on about the mixed feeling this movie left me with , so to put things in a shell case - although I am not a big fan of American film-making this movie I really enjoyed - the plot was fine , the cast was good and the directing was great ! P.S. I hope you will be able to express some opinion about the review , as corny as it might be -LRB- pls keep in might the couple of beers I had before writing it :-RRB- -RRB- " ,9
" A look at terrorism through one man ... Don Cheadle . `` Traitor '' is a unique spy thriller . Why ? Not giving too much of the plot and twists away , it 's about terrorism . The film is shown through Samir Horn -LRB- Don Cheadle -RRB- , a government agent who sells bombs to terrorists who acquaints himself to a terrorist organization so they can attack the U.S. Simultaneously , Samir and the organization is being tracked by two federal agents -LRB- Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough -RRB- . Unlike many past thrillers , terrorists are depicted in the stereotypical way as the bad guys . Yes , they can be considered evil , however , the movie does n't necessarily show them as villains , rather as ordinary people who believe they are fulfilling Allah 's will . This brings ambivalence into the character Samir , as a devout Muslim , whether he 's doing what is right or wrong . So the question that lingers through the film is : Has Samir a really gone rogue ? The other characters in the film are equally as mysterious in where their loyalties lie , except for the jihadist Omar -LRB- Said Taghmaoui -RRB- . This makes the movie very enjoyable . `` Traitor '' is not a film for everyone . It has action sequences , but not in the quantity or leagues of `` The Bourne Ultimatum '' . At times , the movie can get slow . So , action junkies maybe disappointed . And people may be bothered by the terrorist topics and ideas . Overall , I liked the film 's plot , twists , and brilliant cast . 8\/10 " ,7
" terrorism\/patriotic Muslim -LRB- Americans -RRB- . very respected moderate undercover Muslim man working for the CIA in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States and very respected moderate FBI agent . This movie lives in the real world , i think this is the first movie that gives a thoughtful approach , showing the difference between radical terrorist Islam and true Islam -LRB- Samir -RRB- and how the terrorists think , what it is that they are really after , how they are really organized and much more . Now I must note that the movie had some errors , some small details in the terrorists ethics and culture , one is the salafist radical Muslims do n't use the Rosary beads ... i hope this movie will change the idea of all Muslims are terrorist and all Americans want to destroy Islam . " ,10
" A great movie -- but quite a bit is ` borrowed ' from others . The fundamental idea -- an American Muslim going undercover with Terrorists is straight from the pages of the books by Alex Berenson . I bet others before Alex had the same idea . Certainly not an original idea by Steve Martin . If you like this movie get a copy of Faithful Spy by Alex Berenson . The movie starts with music that seems straight from ` Ronin ' . It was so close that I went home to check if the score was by the same person . But no , another rip-off . Getting beyond these obvious problems -- this is a very good movie . One of the best I 've seen all summer . Don Cheadle is extraordinarily believable -- I suspected all along he was a US Spy -- but even so I was never quite sure until deep into the movie . I loved how torn his character was between doing what 's right for his country and what 's right for the Islam he truly believes in . " ,7
" Thought-provoking and told from an amazingly refreshing perspective . A masterful film . The cinematography is beautiful . What makes `` Traitor '' shine is the perspective it is told from , and how the audience 's mental viewpoint\/perception of which side the lead character is on weaves and twists invisibly whilst keeping a good pace and giving the story room to breathe . Telling it almost dispassionately from the bad guy 's point of view is a subtle stroke of genius , and at many points in time it is genuinely difficult to tell whether Cheadle 's man is a good guy or an evil bombmaker . Luckily all is revealed gradually , at a comfortable rate , so you almost do n't notice how far along the storyline you 've come . If it 's possible to be gentle and violent at the same time , this film does it well . You do n't feel fooled , you feel too immersed to have known . The realism and attention to detail was good enough to keep the whole thing from falling into cheesy superhero FBI agent territory and being lost in plot holes -LRB- such as the money exchange , explosives and sent-mail trick -RRB- , and subtle explanations of how things occurred off-screen helps the viewer put the pieces together without overwhelm . The characters are reasonably developed , and although Cheadle 's performance is as excellent as ever , much can be said for Pearce 's gathered maturity as the way he underplays his role makes it unrecognisable from some of his cheesier and more wooden past . There 's little gratuitous wastage of minutes on unnecessary information - all that 's there is what 's needed to tell the story . Nothing more , nothing less . You know an unseasoned plier of any trade by their urge to capture attention and appear `` clever '' by filling things to the brim , and the director 's discernment of avoiding dramatic and overt turnarounds in character motivation and plot allows for a very seamless but captivating portrayal of the various scenes and changing events . The film flows naturally with a life of its own without all the false starts and sudden moments that most traditional 3-Act pieces tend to rely on . The ending was n't perfect by any means , but by then the tension and momentum is built up sufficiently to allow it to release as calmly as it is created . If anything , it 's clever subtlety and seductive pacing will be what it will receive criticism for as it breaks the crazy-action pattern that 's so worn in Hollywood . Overall a highly enjoyable flick with great substance that shows it is very possible to change a movie dramatically just by masterfully shifting the audience viewpoint without them really realizing .

" The _ true _ last great action thriller of the summer ! . I saw `` Bangkok Dangerous '' with Nicholas Cage and found it to be more like a Southeast Asian remake of `` The Mechanic '' -LRB- a lesser-known Charles Bronson movie from the 1970 's -RRB- . 49 % action\/51 % soap opera . But , this movie was different . The pathos did not overshadow the suspense and action elements . A perfect balance of all three kept me -- almost literally -- on the edge of my seat for the whole movie . From the prologue in 1978 Sudan , where Samir 's father dies in a car bombing -LRB- that I half-expected , and yet still wound up jumping up-and-down at -RRB- . To the final showdown aboard a French freighter outbound from Canada . Don Cheadle does an excellent job playing adult Samir , a half-Sudanese African-American . And , right from the start , he convinces you that Samir is a gun-running mercenary who only gives lip service to Islam if it will help sell his black-market munitions to the highest bidding Arab terrorists . It 's only after the bombing of an American consulate in France that you find out he 's a double-agent working super-deep undercover for a CIA bureaucrat played brilliantly by Jeff Daniels . Their goal ? to find the eponymous-yet-elusive leader of the terrorist group Al Nathir . To do this , however , requires him to play a cat-and-mouse game where neither Samir nor the audience can tell the cats from the mice ! I wo n't spoil the rest by telling you what Al Nathir is planning for the U.S. Nor what steps Samir takes to help the FBI thwart this . But , I will tell you this much . The screenplay for this white-knuckler was co-written by a celebrity whom I previously only thought as `` one wild and crazy guy ! '' So , do I recommend that everyone go see it ? Yes !

The first age , the Beginning Age , is approximately 1986 -LRB- Tracey Ullman Shorts -RRB- to 1990 -LRB- Season 1 and 2 -RRB- . The cartoons were beginning to get the hype they deserved . The Golden Age was the best . Seasons 3 through 8 featured almost zero bad episodes , it was perfect . But then small flaws started appearing after the episode ` The Principal and the Pauper ' -LRB- Season 9 , Episode 2 , 4F23 -RRB- aired . Since we had been accustomed to perfection , we hated it . It then began the Slums Age . But in about season 15 , the show began to rise once again , which is known as the ` Reclaimation Age ' . This episode , in the recent crop of bad ones , was very well done . The idea was a current event , and many people could relate to that . It was well written and the concept of Marge becoming addicted to a game was original and interesting , and Bart being the villain was a very predictable , yet well played ` twist ' so to speak . Many have said the side story of Lisa and Homer is very poor and not supportive to the overall episode , and why this may be true , it was a very nice side story . Take in mind that the Simpsons has had 395 episodes , and have usurped nearly every idea in the book . This was a nice one , and made good sense . Though not as Homeric as we are accustomed to , it was still a good episode . " ,10
" A really sweet natured episode that was surprisingly great . . Starring : Dan Castellaneta as Homer , Mel , Grampa , Krusty . Julie Kavner as Marge Nancy Cartwright as Bart , Kearney and Nelson . Yeardley Smith as Lisa . Hank Azaria as Apu , Moe , Snake , Dr. Nick , Cletus , Comic Book Guy . Harry Shearer as Skinner , Flanders , Lovejoy , Mr. Largo , Mr. Burns . Also with : Tress MacNeille , Maggie Roswell , Pamela Hayden , Karl Wiedergott . I really liked this episode !! It 's really rare that we get an episode with a great plot and a great sub-plot , but they managed to make one . Marge gets into the internet and begins playing an on-line game that Bart plays . When Marge get in to Bart 's personal gaming life , Bart gets angry . Meanwhile , Homer and Lisa have troubles while Homer coaches here soccer team . The Marge-Bart plot was very imaginative and well written , and the Homer-Lisa plot was very funny . One of the many great episodes making up what 's turning out to be a really spectacular season . My rating : \*\*\* 1\/2 out of \*\*\*\* . " ,9
" Lost quality . I really loved the first seasons of the Simpsons , but I think their humor is not fresh anymore . This episode is another proof . The magic that The Simpsons had was trasfering into scene simple situations of the everyday life but in a funny way . The new chapters are about extravagant situations which make no sense at all . The Ronaldo dialogue is annoying , the chapter has a lot of emphasis on a boring online game . Then we have the typical opinions of the writers about various subjects like Christopher Colombus discovery being insignificant or football making whole continents insane , those are also quite annoying , specially because of the emphasis they are given . " ,3
" One of the worst episodes of the entire season . This episode seemed weak and far fetched . We follow Marge Simpson who have discovered an online roleplaying game called Earth Realms . Soon she discovers that almost every single inhabitant of Springfield plays that exact game , and that her son is a highly feared villain in the game . This part is absurd in many ways and bare very little resemblance to how real online roleplaying games are played . This makes a mockery of the younger audience , who can easily see that the script writers does n't waste time on research . Of course you can say that since it is a satiric comedy primarily for adults , it does not have to be accurate . But I fail to see why not . They could easily have made the same story portraying a real MMORG -LRB- Massive multiplayer roleplaying game -RRB- without using every clich in the book . In this episode we also follow Lisa Simpson who have found a liking for football -LRB- soccer for you Americans -RRB- . Homer Simpson steps in as a referee and all kind of hysterical comedy ensues ... That is if you think that showing an stereotypical American who does n't understand the rules of football is funny . This part is even more absurd . The only thing we get out of it is , that it is important to play fair and that European football is tainted by violent supporters . Brazilian football star Ronaldo appears as a guest star , but that is both unnecessary and not funny at all . One has to ask why he is there at all . He bares no real significance to the storyline , and he is so out of place that one has to wonder if the writers just wanted somebody famous to be in the show . The whole episode fails miserably to deliver on the comedy side , and all we get is a quaint and poorly written episode that portraits both online role playing games and football in an inept and naive way , lacking the usual finesse and relevance .

" Donkey Pish . I ca n't remember the last time that a movie squandered as much goodwill in such a short space of time as this one does . The first half is genuinely terrific , as six lairy , sexed-up twenty-somethings flirt , take drugs and confabulate on a yacht anchored off the coast of an unnamed Spanish island . Its like Hollyoaks as directed by Larry Clark , and it is totally gripping . But as soon as the titular incident occurs -LRB- and the titular incident really does occur ; just in case anyone else suspected that the title was merely a jocular come-on -RRB- the plot suddenly helter skelters straight into a brick wall ; turning into the kind of dated , tiresome trash that is n't only shockingly predictable , but also entirely unaware of its own predictability . The film 's twists are broadly apparent a full ten minutes before they occur on screen , which makes for an experience that is n't only boring , but also deeply and repeatedly annoying . This is one of those thrillers in which every cast member gets a turn playing the volatile psychopath , purely because the script ca n't get around the fact that the previous character to go loopy has just been safely locked in a cupboard . It never once stops being faultlessly directed - debutant Oliver Blackburn coaxes some really outstanding performances from his young cast , and there are a couple of devilish moments of genuine suspense and black comedy - but these jiffys are like a tiny number of slowly deflating rubber dinghies sinking into a gigantic ocean of generic pish . People merely looking for explicit sex will be very well served , but the violence and gore is surprisingly tame for something that 's being marketed as a plasma-stained killfest . A very brief , but nevertheless apt and effective homage to Phillip Noyce 's Dead Calm aside -LRB- a film so infinitely superior that I feel guilty for even having mentioned it here -RRB- this is just a shoddy , witless bore of a film . And it all started so well . " ,3
" What a waste of talent . Donkey Punch is more than competently directed , almost every aspect of it is superbly executed - save for the tiny matter called screenplay . The plot is so tired words can not begin to describe it . There is not one event that can not be foreseen from miles ahead by anyone who has seen more than two thriller movies in recent years . The director is obviously very talented , and even the acting is above average compared to this type of fare -LRB- I 'm looking at you My Bloody Valentine 3D with your silent movie-type overacting -RRB- but the plot is such a bore and there is a distinct lack of suspense throughout that instead of generating thrills it almost put me to sleep . Any real chance of characterization sinks as soon as the characters begin to do awfully predictable and silly things , just for the sake of packing a punch to the audience - which in turn fails because everyone can see them coming . And to think that British public funding is going to such stinking waste of material and talent is beyond comprehension . I am all for subsidizing mainstream films but Donkey Punch is a knockoff of dozens of movies we have seen , most of them better written . Just a touch of originality would have elevated Donkey Punch to at least an average level , as it is now it is just not worth the time and investment . On the plus side : the soundtrack is awesome .

" Have n't I Already Seen This ? . I found myself at a screening of this at the Sydney Film Festival - one of the producers was there to talk up the ` wild ride ' we were about to be taken on which should have been a warning that it was n't going to be that great . It starts off pretty well with a bunch of very attractive English party holidaymakers -LRB- very realistic , I 've seen their types all around the world -RRB- hooking up for what is going to be a slightly sordid adventure . Once the title is mentioned in the film -LRB- Huzzah ? anyone -RRB- you pretty much know exactly what 's going to happen . Yes , it 's a thriller but when there are seven people on a boat you pretty much know from the beginning that there 's going to be a last man standing . The only real suspense is trying to guess which one it 's going to be . All seven characters are complete stereotypes -LRB- really bad guy , ruthless guy , good guy and not so bad guy forced to do really bad things ; party girl who gets knocked off early ; middle ground party girl and slightly less inclined party girl -RRB- . The characters get knocked off with very little imagination and it requires a bit of suspension of disbelief . I 'm not going to ask for the 90 minutes back but I 'm certainly not going to recommend it for anyone else to see - especially if they 've already seen ` Dead Calm ' ; ` Shallow Grave ' or any other film where a bunch of people are ` forced ' into killing each other ... " ,4
" Erotic and Gore . The girlfriends Lisa -LRB- Sian Breckin -RRB- , Kim -LRB- Jaime Winstone -RRB- and Tammi -LRB- Nichola Burley -RRB- travel from Leeds to Mallorca , Spain , to spend a couple of days together having good-time on the beach . They meet Marcus -LRB- Jay Taylor -RRB- , Bluey -LRB- Tom Burke -RRB- and Josh -LRB- Julian Morris -RRB- in a bar where they steal a bottle of champagne for fun . The young men tell that they are the crew of a motor pleasure yacht and they invite the girls to visit the vessel , where they introduce the chief-engineer Sean -LRB- Robert Boulter -RRB- . The seven youngsters use ecstasy and smoke the powerful Russian Ice ; Bluey talks about kinky sex including Donkey Punch and Dirty Sanchez ; and they decide to navigate to the Mediterranean deep sea to see the sunset . The easy Lisa has sex with Bluey first and then anal sex with Josh ; Vic has sex with Marcus and Tammi stays on the main deck talking to Sean . When Josh decides to practice Donkey Punch on Lisa , he accidentally kills the girl , in the beginning of a nightmarish gore night . `` Donkey Punch '' begins erotic , with three sexy actresses very exposed , and ends gore after a weird accident . The title refers to a fictitious and mortal practice of anal sex , when the penetrated partner is punched on the head or neck to tight the anal passage and increase the orgasm of the partner . The greatest surprise in the story is that none of the partners use condom , i.e. , all of them has unprotected sex . `` Donkey Punch '' will never be nominated to any Award , but it is entertaining and I liked it . My vote is seven . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : `` Prazeres Mortais '' -LRB- `` Deadly Pleasures '' -RRB- " ,7
" Monkey business , donkey punch . Olly Blackburn 's classy but nasty thriller ` Donkey Punch ' takes a number of standard tricks of the genre : the isolated location , the failing communications equipment , a steadily rising body count ; and adds one of its own , namely the lethal fall out from the use of the obscure sexual technique of its title . The opening portions are almost unwatchable , as one waits to see who is going to fall victim to this maneuver , against a discomforting backdrop of youthful hedonism . Yet the movie only strengthens as it goes on , the director underlays the mounting gore , uses music impeccably , and there are honest , gutsy performances from the cast . Fundamentally , this becomes a movie about what ordinary people will do to survive in extreme conditions ; not pretty , but I found the basic psychology believable . Overall , much better than expected . " ,8
" Donkey DOOOO . i am going to keep this brief ... if you value the use of your time this is one to miss . the film actually had an interesting start -3 young woman on a girls holiday meets a group of lads on holiday in a rented boat , drinks , drugs , flirting and banter ... at this point you are still awaiting the film to really kick in , however up until this point , the film is still more than just watchable , which i thought had potential to continue in its tracks ... suddenly , the whole film changes direction , they ` lose the plot ' so to speak . . after a perfectly filmed porno styled orgy scene where the infamous DONKEY PUNCH DEATH occurs and the the carnage begins ... words can not explain how unrealistic the rest of the film plays out . . completely idiotic unbelievable murderous acts coming at you like flock of seagulls until all but the ` good girl ' is left . . it was laughable . sorry guys ! plot-less and pointless - very disappointing . " ,1
" Donkey Poop . A group of young British men and woman on holiday in Spain go yachting , but things get ugly after one of them turns up dead . This is an amateurish , low-budget thriller that veers from soft-core porn to repellent violence , but is mostly lame , particularly the premise that leads to the first death . It is poorly acted by a group of unknown actors , most making their film debuts . Blackburn makes his feature film debut as director and co-writer but he 's in over his head . For non-British viewers , the soundtrack is also a problem if subtitles are not available , as the actors mumble their lines in heavy English accents . " ,2
" The Descent with Sex and Men and No Monsters . I was pleasantly surprised by this film . The Leeds lasses on a jolly girls excursion made it seem quite parochial , to the extent that the Yanks will probably need subtitles , and there is a central moral vacuousness -LRB- in the deeds -RRB- which is nonetheless appropriately dealt with in terms of who gets what and how . Very often this kind of film leaves you frustrated in terms of d nouement , but I thought that comeuppance was most appropriately dealt out and the ending does n't let you down , inasmuch as you can figure on how things might develop post-movie -LRB- imagine this going to court ! -RRB- . I thought the acting was really good , there was a good dose of -LRB- black -RRB- humor and the film could be read on many levels -LRB- as much as a class conflict as anything else -RRB- . Great little film , hard to spot the low budget . " ,8
" Uninspired Tedium . The content of graphic sex , sexual violence , drug taking and murder are aimed at an audience that wants to be titillated , and in this modest aim Donkey Punch more or less succeeds.Yet somehow Director Oliver Blackburn squanders reliable staple teen horror fare into an indigestible mess which is difficult to stomach . Four young men and three young women , party , have sex , and then become embroiled in a deathfest when one of the girls dies during a sex act.The acting is fairly good , the characters are fine and the girls , Sian Breckin , Nichola Burley and Jaime Winston -LRB- daughter of Ray -RRB- look good and are a teenage boys dream , well up for it . A setting on a boat always has dramatic potential , confined space , isolation , no escape . It also has some drawbacks , physically you are limited with what you can do.This is where Blackburn errs.The first half hour of scene setting as the characters get to know each other is fine , and the sex scene is convincing . But once the bloodletting starts everything spirals out of control.The actions of the characters are inconsistent at best , and unbelievable at worst.This is no psychological thriller , if you do n't know what to do - kill someone , that appears to be the maxim.Each sequence is so episodic , so stand alone , that there appears to be little link with what else is going on.By the end the dramatic tension has evaporated and you just want EVERYONE to die , but quickly . Apparently this was shot in 24 days , which is quick . But this is no excuse for an inadequate script and screenplay . " ,4
" Decadence and Deception . The vacation that descends into hell often seems to do so in ways that were unavoidable , like like the unfortunate backpackers in Hostel had no real way of knowing the horror that awaits them . It is also a way to garner sympathy for the protagonist , they are not stupid just deceived and therefore a victim . That is not so in Donkey Punch where it is the main characters that do almost everything possible to ensure trouble , then one of them actually does and makes the conscious decision to execute perverse sexual act that results in all the things that they all did n't want . The difference is more subtle than it seems , but it is a key difference ... there is bad place and the trouble one makes is only through their own stupidity . Then they have to pay for it . While the title may sound sensationalist and exploitative , the film is really not just that ; there is graphic sex including the infamous donkey punch show right on screen as well as some very lurid violence . However , the portrayal of it all does n't focus on this sensationalism , but uses it to show the film 's underlying theme of how a web of lies eventually spins out of control leaving no one safe and everyone pitted against everyone else . It is that well developed psychological element that makes Donkey Punch more than just worth a watch . The initially happy and charming characters turn really ugly and even downright repulsive by the end . They are not victims of external force , but of their own actions . This then begs the question : were they were like that from the start ? -- 8\/10 BsCDb Classification : 16 + -- sexual content , violence " ,8
" Farcical ` thriller ' all at sea . Despite an early , glossy , this-film-should-have-been-made-in-the-90s fizz , Donkey Punch quickly degenerates into total farce . Whilst the orgy scene is genuinely erotic and skillfully done , that might as well have been the conclusion of the movie , not the pivotal scene that defines the film . Because thereon after , every agonisingly cheesy clich from teen slasher movies right through to low budget horror farce is played out here and it is ultimately the fault of the banal script and utterly horrendous direction . At what point does the production crew stop and think : ` This is actually not working ? ' . If we , the audience , can conclude that some 30 minutes in , it defies logic that the ` finished ' product was wrapped up and presented as some kind of genuine horror-thriller . A mess , and not worthy of the time you will spend watching it . " ,2
" what a clunker . having been somewhat looking forward to this movie , more because of the titillating title than anything else , i finally got round to seeing it . I have to say this movie is probably the biggest missed opportunity of the year . A interesting set-up\/premise , competently directed but completely let down by a real clunker of a script . It 's nearly half an hour before anything remotely happens , which would n't be so bad if we were getting to know the characters , some back story etc , but nothing . Each character is a complete no entity , bland , two dimensional , each spurting flat dialogue which you can almost imagine them reading from the page . The only character who has any back story is Tammi , who 's broken up with the boyfriend who cheated on her , therefore we 're supposed to care about her ; and because she 's the only one who protests , momentarily , joining the guys on the boat , we know she 's the one who will be the ` last man standing ' . The blond , sexually adventurous one , you know straight away is the one who is going to ` get ' it ... and , ho hum , she is . Could this film be any more predictable . After the ` incident ' everything becomes totally unrealistic and over the top . The writing is just so bad . One moment Tammi pulls a knife on the guys but then is disarmed . Then while the guys are trying the sink the body they leave the girls free to get away . They do n't go back to the knives which they know are there instead they run inside the boat , find a hatch and climb back outside again . I could go on but i really ca n't be arsed . The only thing i liked about the movie was the poster . " ,2
" director should be donkey punched . A friend recommended this and he is not a friend anymore . How did this ever get made ? It is ridiculous film completely . Is this all British film funding can invest in - a film bout someone getting killed by a ` slap of the penis ' ? Maybe the problem is that most directors need a couple of films before they produce something worthwhile . But how on earth did the director think that a story like this would be a good idea ? Im baffled and completely out of touch with his though processes . Its all a bit ` laddy ' for me , film with kids taking drugs , looking for sex with backing rave music , then some ` tarantino rip-off ' drama happens . Better British films out there like ` The Business ' . One to avoid at all costs . " ,1
" Good music , but the what the fu \* k ? storyline gets old and tired . . Donkey Punch has a very interesting -LRB- although fu \* ked up -RRB- premise in which seven people have a party on a yacht out in the Mediterranean sea , only to have one of them try the infamous donkey punch during sex with one of the women ... and accidentally kills her . Now , what they could have done with the paranoia between the surviving characters would have been interesting , but they degraded the plot even more from it 's fu \* ked up premise into a stupid slasher film . Not only that , but it 's also hard to tell what 's happening on screen for most of the time . Stupid and unbelievable situations continue to unravel themselves . But , I have to be honest . I actually liked the film up until the actual donkey punch . After that happened the film just got lazy . But , hey , it had some good music though . " ,3
" Everything You Never Wanted to Know About Sex -LRB- But Have Been Forced to Find Out -RRB- . Parodying the title of David Reuben 's sex manual Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex -LRB- But Were Afraid to Ask -RRB- , the late Douglas Adams came up with an idea for a book called Everything You Never Wanted to Know About Sex -LRB- But Have Been Forced to Find Out -RRB- . If such a book actually existed , the sexual act from which this film takes its title would no doubt feature in it , perhaps to the extent of having a whole chapter dedicated to it . If you want to know what a donkey punch involves you will have to watch the film , although I can report that it does not actually involve donkeys . The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will doubtless be happy to note that no donkeys were punched during the making of this film . Whether the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Audiences will be so happy is another matter . Three attractive girls named Lisa , Kim and Tammi , on holiday in Majorca , meet four young men who invite them to their yacht . That sounds like the opening scene of a softcore porn film , and at first it seems that that is exactly what Donkey Punch is turning into . Unfortunately , matters take a more serious turn when Lisa is killed during a sex game that goes wrong . This leads to a conflict among the group . The surviving women Kim and Tammi want to report Lisa 's death to the authorities , whereas the men want to throw her body over the side and pretend that she drowned after falling overboard . The survivors then start fighting amongst themselves , and the film descends into a spiral of violence , with several more people being killed in a variety of unpleasant ways . Something like this could have been the basis of an intriguing thriller along the lines of Dead Calm , another film which takes place on board a yacht . -LRB- The manner of one of the deaths in this film seems to be a detail borrowed directly from Dead Calm -RRB- . Dead Calm , however , works as a thriller because it emphasises tension over actual violence and gives us characters , particularly the young woman played by Nicole Kidman , whom we can care about and with whom we can identify . Donkey Punch , by contrast , does neither . The characters are a generally unpleasant lot who will do nothing to dispel the widely-held perception of young Britons abroad as drunken , loutish and rampantly promiscuous . There are a few moments of genuine tension immediately after Lisa 's death , but thereafter the film simply descends into gore and mayhem ; the only tension is that involved in playing a game of guess who will be the next to be killed , and how . Donkey Punch is a film as nasty and sadistic as the act from which it takes its name . This was director Oliver Blackburn 's first feature film ; I can only hope for the sake of his career that his second will be a huge improvement on his first . 3\/10 " ,3
" Strangely handled material . I 've been a little curious to see this one for a long time , and after finally getting to see it ... it 's one of the most puzzling movies I 've seen . The dialogue is nearly incomprehensible . In watching material like Shaun of the Dead , I usually get used to accents after a short time , but with this one , it started reasonably understandable , but by around halfway through it , I started having a very hard time . Far too much time is spent setting the scenario up . Once the girl dies , the movie feels like it should be over . The drama that ensues feels absurd to me . I can understand that some people are able to take control of others pretty effectively , but the lack of opposition seems to be unbelievable . People start making decisions that do n't make much sense . I think that the girls would have both realized that they should n't light a signal flare if they do n't want the people nearby to notice . The deaths get stranger as the movie progresses . One guy dies by a knife , and that 's handled well . Then someone dies by having a flare fired into his chest , then it ignites him on fire ? Then someone dies by some tool - it resembled a weed wacker , but I 'm not sure what it was . That one seemed particularly strange , but made all the more strange by how the killer had no motivation to kill . The movie is otherwise competently made . The poor lighting out on a boat in the middle of the night is understandable . I ca n't evaluate the script since it was impossible to understand . With some editing and general re-shaping of the story , the movie could be a nice teen thriller . But as it stands , it 's not much more than a curiosity . " ,4
" Trashy flick for teens . Take some young ladies , probably models , who ca n't act . Take some young lads , probably models , who ca n't act . Put them on a yacht , and throw in a script that seems to have been written minutes before . Get a guy from somewhere , call him a director and tell him to make some astounding rubbish . As it 's going to be absolute tat you might as well try to make it controversial . Oh , and there 's no budget either so it 's gon na look cheap . Yep , it 's gon na be something like an English version of Cabin Fever . The film is appalling on every level . The old clich of ` you 'll never get back the 90 minutes of your life ' applies here . Only 15-18 year old 's will rate this movie , as it 's aimed at them . Really , really bad . " ,1
" Not as bad as they made out !! . I watched this film over the weekend after putting it off numerous times because the rumors were very off-putting . However , I have to say that I did n't think it was that bad . For a start , I can always appreciate a good British movie and Jaime Winstone is doing a great job of following in her dads footsteps -LRB- i do like a common bird -RRB- . The other actresses left a little to be desired in the acting stakes but the majority of the male casting was pretty believable -LRB- i know people just like them -RRB- . Take it in context ; if you want to see a film with excessive violence in it and a sex scene that did very well not to get the chop , then this is your movie ; It has all you could desire . Definitely worth watching just for the experience . " ,8
" Absolute tripe . . I only watched this because it was on Film 4 last night , and wanted to see if it deserved the bad reviews , well it most certainly did . I am astounded that Channel 4 saw fit to invest in this vile film that just set out to shock . It also worries me that we have sunk as low as this in terms of humanity to consider this as entertainment , I love horror movies , but this had no redeeming features whatsoever . As an aside , if the people portrayed in this film are an accurate representation of young Britons abroad , then I 'm glad I do n't bother with run of the mill holiday resorts with the binge drinking and all that goes with it . " ,1
" Utter waste of time and money . I wo n't bother going into an elaborate description of the plot . Suffice to say , this was an utterly annoying and stupid movie . It beggars belief that movies as bad as this one can get more than a two-star rating . To save people the anguish of watching this nonsense , I 'll give you the story in a nutshell . A group of 20-something men and women get together to have a night of sex and drugs . One of the women is killed by a donkey punch during a sexual encounter -LRB- this was supposed to be a joke , and she was not supposed to be actually hit -RRB- . The group start fighting and try to distance themselves from the killing . In the end , all but one of the actors dies . The last one is left adrift on a lifeboat in the darkness . This movie was written and directed by two guys and was based on an idea from one of the two . Personally , I think he should have kept the idea to himself ... " ,1
" Terrible Movie . Please please do not put your self through this two hours of rubbish !! Do not get drawn in by the promises of sex , drugs and violence . Really really really really bad movie and cleft lip man -LRB- Tom Burke -RRB- is a terrible actor . This sums this movie up perfectly Before I saw Donkey Punch , I was somewhat tolerant of British film . Now I feel inexplicable anger that such raging self indulgent sh \* t can still make it onto the cinema screen . The world will shun this movie . There will be mass concessions of people collecting around twenty foot holes dug in the Sahara desert , just so they can symbolically bury the DVD release . " ,1
" Does n't really pack any sort of ` Punch ' . In the sparkling tradition of ` Very Bad Things , ' ' A Simple Plan ' and ` Open Water 2 : Adrift , ' comes a ` Donkey Punch ' that 's a dozen of hits inferior to the films it 's mirroring . Sure it 's more serious than ` Things ' and ` Plan ' but what made those fun to watch was that they did n't take themselves so seriously . This ` Donkey ' movie was made by people that have never seen those three , or any other young adult ` Oh , I 've never met you , so I guess it 's safe to go with you to ___ -LRB- fill in destination -RRB- film . There 's got to be countless ones out there . The twist , I suppose they were shooting for was the said title . What takes seconds to explain what it is does n't make this much more original than ` Things ' or ` Plan . ' Three girl friends meet four guy friends while on holiday in Spain and opt for a sunset cruise on a yacht . After one dies by a -LRB- insert title here -RRB- , the action , suspense and paranoia ensures . When the movie turns cat mouse , everyone out for themselves , hurting each other , plotting , etc , it 's not terrible , but horribly unoriginal , predictable and gives us zero characters\/heroes in which to root for . Granted most of us have n't been involved in such circumstances , we ca n't honestly say what we would do . However , having seen at least 48 movies like this one , I think I 'll have a pretty good idea of what NOT to do . I think if it really did happen to me , and they made it into a movie , chances are it would just a 5-minute You-tube clip . One other problem I had , and I 'm probably in the minority , but though I speak English , I find myself using the English subtitles more with such thick English accents . Unfortunately , this DVD only had Spanish subtitles . ` Very Bad Things ' and ' A Simple Plan ' are highly recommended over this . Even the low-rated -LRB- but I actually enjoyed -RRB- ` Open Water 2 : Adrift ' is a better rental . " ,3
" Wild teens on a boat goes awry after Donkey Punch . Probably one of the dead hippest films of 2008 Oliver Blackburn 's Donkey Punch from the UK is a treat . I saw it at MIFF in Melbourne . Its about three 20 year old girls hooking up with four likely lads on their luxurious boat and heading out to sea after the Spainish coast to smoke Russian Ice and take pills . At the height of the merriment discussing kinky sex , the subject of a Donkey Punch comes up . DP is a misogynist sex technique where you punch a women in the back of the head , as you are about to achieve release in the doggy style position , to give her involuntary spasms in a certain part of the female anatomy . Its mostly urban myth , the reality of this sex technique ... though I 'm sure some idiot has tried it . Anyway , during a preceding orgy the loner geek of the group is egged on to do a Donkey Punch and kills , naturally , the blonde . Chaos ensues as the youngsters bump each other off - either trying to cover up said death or trying to get away from the cover up to tell the Police . Great film . Blackburms direction is assured and the script suitably on the edge . Young , well shot , dead hip , drug fuelled , dangerous , controversial . Strong performance by a young cast round the film out well , especially that of the heroine Jaime Winstone -LRB- I assume thats Ray 's daughter ? -RRB- . From Warp films . A lethal hip treat . " ,8
" Bad . Real Bad . I mean bad all the way around bad . Just just BAD . .

'' If I was from 17-24 and I saw this movie I 'd never seen another movie from the writer or director of this wreck ever again . I would protest . I would say , I am not that stupid . This is n't a horror film , so I can not forgive them . The movie purports that all young people are morons . The acting can get no lower -LRB- who are these fools who think they can act -RRB- , the look and sound of the movie is like high school audio visual class crap . The movie sucks . Do n't give these monsters a dime of your money . " ,1
" Oh god . I will admit that I rented this movie because of the title . I thought it would be a low budget horror movies that would just make you laugh . However , this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Really , do n't waste your money on this movie . It does not frighten you , it just is full of blood and gore . The acting is also atrocious , and if you have not been living in the UK for the past few years you will not understand there mumblings . Susannah says ring ring ... hello . The reason why I gave this a 3 was because the plot does have to deal with the basic idea of human instinct in extreme situations which is an interesting theme . " ,3
" Refreshingly 18 certificate for 18yr olds . From the sun-bleached fake Mallorca coastline all the way to sangria-soaked rough accents of young holiday Brits , Donkey Punch hits a tacky new high in English cinema . Squarely aimed at the 18-something bubbly-drinking Ibizia types , we have three luscious babes and four gorgeous hunks showing you can have sex , drugs and violence all in abundance , leaving behind the pass pap of American teenage road movies . Donkey Punch is ultra-chic and blows conservative values out the water as we race around on a luxury yacht . The story 's realistic , easy on the attention span , and appeals to regular Saturday night audiences , dates and popcorn . The moral of the story , by the way , is not that you should n't film yourself having unprotected group sex while high on various drugs . But that you should n't invite your younger brother ... There 's no mad stalker . There 's no deep-seated evil persona . There 's just healthy young kids having a good time and accidentally killing each other . Nor do we find any sexist connotations . Men and women are equal here . Both in getting their kit off and bumping up the body count . Says director Olly Blackburn , `` We did a lot of old fashioned , journalist-style research . We went and spoke to people - yacht crews , DJs , and people up in Leeds and down on the South coast . '' Not forgetting it 's a psychological thriller , he adds , `` We spoke with a clinical psychiatrist about stress and trauma situations . '' Which maybe accounts for the realistic note that lifts Donkey Punch above the median . Kim , Tammi and Lisa are best mates from Leeds . Off on a girls ' weekend . They 're up for it , giggling , dancing and flirting . They meet up on the beach with three rather nice cockney lads . Marcus , Bluey and Josh . Swigging champagne they 've nicked , the lads boast about a luxury yacht they 're crewing . They all get back there , where they 're met by Sean , who 's been looking after things on deck . The girls are impressed and start spinning the DJ decks . The boys think of an excuse to give the owners if they take the boat out . At sea , you can play the music as loud as you want while swimming , sunning and doing a bit of social drugs -LRB- ecstasy followed by something brown with a bit of a kick -RRB- . So how does it all go terribly wrong ? Donkey Punch is an 18 certificate for 18yr olds , and refreshing in that it has n't been watered down for younger kids or prurient American audiences . There are no ` victims ' just people making some rather rash decisions under pressure and after a young lad mistakenly takes an urban myth too seriously . It makes no pretensions to be anything other than good entertainment . As a debut feature , it hits the mark and is a welcome addition to the bourgeoning output of original British film . " ,7
" Unlikeable movie . I 'm not sure exactly why this is so bad - maybe because there are so many things wrong . Acting was fair . Most characters were annoying and one dimensional . Most people will watch it for the punch ' but it is slow leading up to it and slow afterward . I was relieved to see some of them die . Technically - portions of the movie were so black that you could not see what was happening and this was is places where it lent nothing to the script or movie to do so . Clich s - Many with no twist . Because nothing ever goes wrong when a bunch of kids go party with strangers on a boat ... Joke is on the viewer - real person who got punched . " ,3
" Not really worth giving a hee haw about . . Definition of a donkey punch : a blow administered to the back of a female 's neck while their sexual partner , positioned behind them , approaches climax . This produces an involuntary clenching of muscles and increases the pleasure felt by the selfish male lover . Definition of Donkey Punch : a mediocre film trying desperately to make itself memorable by basing things around one scene that will stick in your mind for a while -LRB- and I am sure that you can guess what that one scene involves -RRB- . There 's a young cast all trying to prove their worth , and not really making any impression at all . There are a few loud dance tunes before things take a turn for the worse . There are even some moments that come close to being tense\/entertaining before failing and reverting back to the standard , boring on screen action you have to endure with this group of unlikeable characters you really do n't give a toss about . Slick and , for the most part , safe and packaged in a teen-friendly way , this is a bland waste of time that I would recommend others avoiding . Writer\/director Oliver Blackburn probably thought he was doing something a bit different and entertaining - he was n't . See this if you like : Dead Calm , The Hole , Open Water 2 : Adrift . " ,4
" Full-on thrill ride . This film reportedly created quite a stir when it was released in the UK due to it 's portrayal of the dodgy mores of young British holidaymakers overseas . There is certainly no dispute that the prudish will find no end of things to dislike about this explicitly raunchy , hard-nosed thriller . The film centers on three up-for-it young women from Leeds who are invited by four equally fun-loving young guys to hang out on a yacht where the lads were employed as crew members . This intrepid group then sail out to sea , turn up the music , ingest some Ecstasy and what looks like crystal meth , and start getting very intensely busy with each other . However , just as this orgy is reaching it 's peak , a sexual technique goes wrong and somebody dies . Things get worse when the group , stoned and terrified of the consequences they may face , can not agree on how to handle the situation . All of a sudden , what had started out as an ill-considered but probably harmless outing turns into a nightmare of panic , paranoia , and murder as all the characters realize that they are going to have to fight for their lives . The ensemble cast are top notch . The premise is credible and the behavior of the well-drawn characters remains believable . The film deftly changes pace in a heartbeat from depicting joyous hedonism to ice-cold fear and suspicion . The pacing is spot-on and the tension and sense of mounting horror are relentless . The soundtrack is also right on target . The only cause for complaint might be the thickness of some of the English accents but it really is not a big deal . On some other websites Donkey Punch has gotten very mixed reviews - people seem to love it or hate it . However , if you 're interested in seeing an overlooked but world-class thriller then this film ought to be top of your list . Highly recommended . " ,8
" Not nice , but not bad . This small scale British film was partially funded with Lottery money , and has certain elements of the right-wing press frothing at the mouth for the way it portrays young British people . I have to say that it 's not a nice film . But that does n't necessarily mean that it 's a bad film , or an unenjoyable film . Three young women from the north of England go on holiday to the Mediterranean . They accept an invitation onto a boat crewed by four young men . What follows is an evening of drugs and sex , culminating in the donkey punch of the title - a mythical sexual act invented by one of the men and foolishly put into effect by one of the others , as a result of which one of the girls dies . The four men and the two surviving girls then have to decide what to do about the dead girl , and the various different personal agendas and deteriorating relationships lead one to wonder if they will all survive the night -LRB- it 's probably not a spoiler if I say that they do n't -RRB- . It 's fair to agree that the early part of the film does n't paint the young people involved in a creditable light -LRB- with the exception of one of the girls and one of the lads who are somewhat more restrained than the others -RRB- . It would be foolish to deny that this sort of activity goes on , albeit it may not be as widespread as Outraged of Guildford might think . The final two-thirds , though , after the set-up , are a decent thriller of the `` last man standing '' variety , livened up by the fact that we are n't waiting for the killer to catch them all one by one , it 's more a matter of who is going to do in who . It 's also fair to say that it has the look of a very polished movie from its first-time director , it plays well on the claustrophobic nature of its location -LRB- where , of course , it is far from alone -RRB- , and its young cast certainly go for it in every way - they are all very good . As something of an old right-wing git myself , I was n't outraged - I was gripped all the way through , and rather enjoyed it . " ,7
" tear jerkingly awful . OK , there are few if any films I have stopped watching half way through because they were just so bad it was unbearable to go any further . I even watched all of evil bong . BUT , Donkey Punch is without a doubt the most insulting thing to a persons intelligence ever . Remember the sub title or hype talks about an `` accident '' , and I suspected it was to do with a punch , which is not an accident . Hard to punch someone in back of head by accident , anyway . Well that is it , the guy punches girl in the back of the head and goes from there . But where I stopped was right after it was obvious that it was going to be all about this punch on the back of the head , and by the way the build up is an out of the blue comment , `` oh do you know what a donkey punch is '' just for those dumb enough in the audience to a -RRB- watch the film and b -RRB- not know what it is and also c -RRB- dumb enough to watch the whole film anyway it is beaming sun light , they go below , punch in head , oh my god oh my god , go up top and BAM , middle of the night . WHAT ??? where did a few hours go ???? And since when does a boat come to a complete stop when you turn the engine off , surely it floats forward a little ??? Timeline is all over the place unless they went out and started drinking at 5am in the morning . Anyway I bowed out at this stage . OH yeah one guy video 's it and its clear other young brother guy did it but for some unknown reason the another guy who does n't even like the guy who did it is worried he might get in trouble . EH , you did n't do anything and there is video to prove it ???? PLUS , yes there is more , one of them just happens to be going to law school , and it so happens he is the one who did nothing . Some lawyer he will make if he ca n't even defend himself . I have spent more time writing this comment then the film deserves . I wonder if I can sue for trauma or slander for thinking I am such a moron to miss the holes in this movie . It is a lotto money granted job so as a protest I am never buying a lotto ticket again . Thats how bad this film is . Watch it you will love it hahahahaha " ,1
" Worth the watch ! . I 'm not sure what I expected when I put Donkey Punch on . I did n't read much about it and only vaguely remember a trailer for it back in 2008 . The basic plot is girls decide to go on a holiday to Spain to take their friend 's mind off her cheating ex . Cue sun , sea and nightclubbing where they meet three young men and later another man who just happen to be a part of a crew of a yacht . More sun sea and partying with kinky stories told of a the movies namesake . During a graphic sex scene between five of the revellers one of the girls is accidentally killed . Lies and desperation the men try to hide their crime while the girls want to expose them , leading to a fight for survival . The story was all well and good and the acting was very well done especially the characters of Bluey and Kim . Some have said it was predictable and it does follow a slightly typical storyline of boys vs girls . However , there is more . Unlike Hollywood productions like this there is no stalking serial killer in a mask , no thick girls screaming while running upstairs instead of out the door . The script was sometimes a bit disjointed and I did lose interest once or twice which was a shame . Overall it was interesting , brutal but enjoyable and entertaining . The deaths were not over the top and sometimes it felt quite realistic . It was easy to forget it was so low budget . Not for everyone and not one to watch with your Nan but definitely if you are a fan of Brit flicks give it a shot . " ,7
" When things do n't happen according to plan . A group of young people go to a trip in a boat and many of them are going to die . At first sight we might think it 's gon na be a predictable and corny thriller , but this one is an exception to this rule . The story is very plausible and sometimes it reminds me of House of 9 -- a great picture . I do n't know how , but the filmmakers managed this film so well that you get extremely entertained in the drama . Oh , and I have to mention that this movie , in my opinion , is much more a drama than a thriller ; be ready to watch a sad story . The actors are believable even thought they are unknown and working for a small company -- they act better than many mainstream actors . My only -LRB- and big -RRB- complaint is the unnecessary exposed sex scene , which did n't need to be that hot or real . It gets embarrassing to watch such movie with your parents in a room right in front of yours -- is n't my case . IMDb 's rating for this title is UNDERRATED and should be fixed as soon as possible , otherwise it 's going to unfairly put it in the same list as the other horrible films out there . " ,7
" Donkey Punch . OK , so I 've just watched this and ca n't really understand why the ratings have been so poor . It 's not brilliant but it 's alright , there are definitely far , far , FAR worse films out there . Basically , three girls go to Majorca for the weekend , meet four blokes and go to their yacht for fun and frolics . Their afternoon of debauchery turns to tragedy when during quite a graphic sex scene one girl , Lisa , is donkey punched resulting in a broken neck and , well , death . Personally I did n't think it was as amazing as some reviews have suggested but I 'm not a 15 year old boy who 's never seen a pair of boobs or a willy before . The rest of the film centres around the remaining characters to fight for their survival involving a lot of blood and violence , all scenes I thought were pretty decent . Do n't be put off by the poor reviews on here , it is worthy of a watch . Watch it if only to watch the annoying bloke bleed slowly to death . " ,7
" The Financiers At The Film Council Have Just Had A Fatal Punching . As soon as the film started I thought there might be something wrong with it . Despite being released in 2008 -LRB- Without any fanfare I should add -RRB- Mallorca seems a strange setting . If it 'd been a film released in 1998 where the Belearic beat tourist resorts were still very popular with Europe 's youth then I might have understood the reason for the location more . This led me to suspect that the screenplay might have been written several years earlier and if you look up director and screenwriter Olly Blackburn 's resume he has indeed been working in film and television ten years prior to the film 's release . Does this indicate the quality - or lack of it - of the screenplay ? Of course I 'm only speculating and after seeing DONKEY PUNCH I was reminded strongly of THE HOLE another film I disliked The story starts with with three young British females visiting Spain . From a moral POV I was going to give them the benefit of the doubt , drinking alcohol and seeking male company does not make a young woman a bad person in anyway . Unfortunately when they meet three English lads to reveal themselves to slappers of the lowest order , smoking crack cocaine , lezzing it up and indulging in casual sex this can only mean one thing - there 's a moral consequence to all this . Actually cinema has replaced the Bible has humanity 's moral compass . I would love to see a film one day where a rabid nympho who takes class A drugs , does n't become addicted , never catches a disease and dies of old age . One thing I have learned in life -LRB- And you probably noticed this to an extent yourself -RRB- is that bad things usually only happen to nice people . Perhaps if the two surviving girls from the orgy had been nicer from society 's moral standpoint it would have been much easier to empathize with their dilemma ? The screenplay does meander . It takes about 40 minutes for the plot 's major inciting incident to happen and when it does the story seems unsure on what it 's trying to be . As soon as the body is dumped overboard I was expecting a very taut and claustrophobic thriller where the two surviving girls hide on a small yacht where the trio of boys have to eliminate all witnesses to the crime . I actually shocked that the financiers to DONKEY PUNCH did n't demand that this is how the screenplay was developed and the direction the story should take . As it stands too much of the running time after this point the characters just sit around asking what we gon na do now ? Get a better agent would be a start As a footnote the financiers of DONKEY PUNCH - The UK Film Council - have been dissolved by the government this week . This is no big deal . Successful British movies such as 28 DAYS LATER have the film council logo in their credits but this is very misleading . The council just put up enough money in to a movie simply so they 'll get a credit but the financing and distribution deal has already been done in most cases usually with an American film company or distributor allowing the film to go a wide release . In reality a large proportion of films where the Film Council are the main funders fail to get released in cinemas . Often down to the reason that they 're underdeveloped and unentertaining to a mainstream audience " ,4
" Under-rated , typically grisly modern Brit horror flick . STAR RATING : \*\*\*\*\* Saturday Night \*\*\*\* Friday Night \*\*\* Friday Morning \*\* Sunday Night \* Monday Morning The vast majority of reviews on this site have n't spoken that favourably of Donkey Punch , one in a line of latest Brit horror flicks high on the gore\/shock factor . The negative comments stem from the apparently gratuitous violence\/sex\/language and the unappealing portrayal of modern British teens . All of which have a point , but then people seem to regard the acting and story as pretty poor as well . It 's certainly not a film for those with faint hearts or weak stomachs , but the actual set up is genuinely suspenseful and tense , with an eerie silence and brooding atmosphere looming over the beautiful Meditteranian sea and the enclosed confines of the luxury ship . As the film wears on , and the situation gets more intense and desperate , it gathers the air of the 1988 thriller Dead Calm , with the set up being so similar . I ca n't speak for the other girls , but Jaime Winstone does a decent enough Yorkshire accent , only occasionally lapsing back into her native cockney . If you enjoyed stuff like Eden Lake , this should provide quite a lot of thrills and excitement . \*\*\*\* " ,9
" What 's not to like ? . I was surprised to see so many people dislike this film . I have a low tolerance for lousy films and consider that everyone has different tastes . This was a VERY pleasant surprise . I had no preconceived ideas from media or any other source and went in with a clean page . This film is slick , sexy , fast-paced and technically competent . The plot is multi-faceted and intelligent if you are prepared to look deep enough . If you 're simply after a slash-horror , this wo n't meet your needs , but if it 's a zippy little thriller that whisks you to the end before you know it ... then weyhey ! Ca n't go wrong . Bear in mind this was shot with limited budget , a new director and unknown actors . Cracking job all round ! " ,8
" Party Monster , anyone ??? . Donkey Punch - 7.5 \/ 10 - A review from the Boston Globe referred to this film as Real World - Death Yacht ... To be honest , this really hit the nail on the head here ... ` Real World - Death Yacht ' it is and just like \* a select few \* past seasons of the Real World , ` Donkey Punch ' may just be a guilty pleasure for some . I never found myself bored in this film . I rented it based on the sole purpose that the film was called ` Donkey Punch ' and appeared to have some pretty boys in it - and well , I was looking for a guilty pleasure ... Not a masterpiece ... To my delight , that is exactly what I got . On a boat with strangers during a vacation in Spain , when things go horribly wrong during an E 'd out orgy sprinkled with dastardly paranoid effects of speed and ` fun in the sun ' , our said British first mates and scared little ladies fall into turning on one another after the boy 's cover up does n't quite hit home with the ladies . As everyone falls deeper and deeper into panic , we watch the lengths each character will go to keep this a secret . store it for later for either proof that it was n't their fault or why they each did what they did ... Well who really knows why each character did what they did ... after all they are all dealing with death of a strangers , a compulsive cover-up , paranoia , and of course all this while they are tweaked out of their minds . Party Monster anyone ? No this film is not a breakthrough of a genre or an award winning masterpiece , but it is well acted , has a great soundtrack and if anyone is in need for a guilty pleasure then Donkey Punch may just be your bloody good fun ! " ,8
" Ambiguous . For a little horror movie this movie , is pretty ambiguous . The title itself refers to a pretty memorable scene , which will be remembered by those who watched the movie , for several reasons . The movie overall has a pretty graphic nature , which wo n't be to everyones taste . Be it the horror or the aforementioned scene . While there are a few flaws in the story and\/or logic development of the movie , this is n't anything that is different from other horror\/psycho thriller movies . Cinematography is nice , acting is decent -LRB- for a genre movie -RRB- and the overall thrill ride is entertaining enough for the running time . Nice movie then " ,7
" Convoluted is the result . Oliver Blackburn 's `` Donkey Punch '' observes the great lengths a group of twentysomethings will go to in order to cover their tracks when tragedy occurs off the coast of Majorca . Six of the individuals had bonded at a brassy nightclub earlier in the night , and they have now met up with the other person who was guarding the expensive yacht for the night . The group can be split into two sections : the three women who do not own the yacht , and the four men who not only own the vessel , but live their life there too . If a tragic situation were to develop , no matter from what source , the group dynamic will always favor the men 's side , and so it does . When you are out in an unknown terrain , with shark-infested waters surrounding your base , there would n't seem too many places for characters to evaporate into thin air , but `` Donkey Punch '' makes a fair fist at sabotaging such logical engagements .

" Donkey Punch . I had heard of the sex term from somewhere , so I knew what to expect , but I have to admit , I was n't expecting this film to be as good as it was . Basically three northern women : Kim -LRB- Kidulthood and Dead Set star Jaime Winstone , Ray 's daughter -RRB- , Lisa -LRB- Sian Breckin -RRB- and Tammi -LRB- Nichola Burley -RRB- , a Mediterranean resort nightclub , meet four eager men Marcus -LRB- Jay Taylor -RRB- , Bluey -LRB- Tom Burke -RRB- , Josh -LRB- Julian Morris -RRB- and Sean -LRB- Robert Boulter -RRB- , who invite them to party on a boat -LRB- belonging to a rich man -RRB- , with alcohol and drugs -LRB- ecstacy and cocaine mainly -RRB- at the ready . They get into a conversation about some sex positions , one of which mentioned is the `` donkey punch '' -LRB- when the man is about to cum doing anal , he pulls out and punches the girl on the back on the neck -RRB- . Not long after , five of them go to the big bedroom and have a near orgy with each other , and unfortunately , trying the `` donkey punch '' , Josh manages to kill Tammi . They decide -LRB- just like I Know What You Did Last Summer -RRB- to dispose of the body and make something up , but with all the fears and consequences , one by one they are all going crazy either with guilt or anger , and erupting into violence . Being shot by flares , stabbed and dying of blood loss , savaged by a spare boat propeller , suicide -LRB- jumping overboard -RRB- and accidental hanging -LRB- with a boat rope -RRB- are just some of the consequences awaiting each character . I was kind of hoping Winstone would be the last to survive , but never mind , each actor gets their moment , the sexual scene is very important and memorable -LRB- especially how it ends -RRB- , and the violence is eye-catching , a very well done low budget British thriller film . Very good ! " ,8
" Grab your woman from behind , proceed to do the bump and grind , just as you 're about to pop , give the girl a karate chop ! . Brit horror\/thriller Donkey Punch is named after an apocryphal sex act that involves giving your partner a whack to the back of the head as you 're about to blow your load , the result supposedly being the rapid tightening of your lover 's muscles and a mind-blowing orgasm for you ! Of course , bashing someone on the back of the head whilst screwing them is not only considered rather impolite in most circles , but also pretty dangerous , as Josh -LRB- Julian Morris -RRB- discovers when he stupidly performs the Donkey Punch on blonde slut Lisa -LRB- Sian Breckin -RRB- , one of a trio of hot babes invited to party with his pals aboard a luxury yacht . Poor Lisa ends up with a broken neck , and Josh and his mates with one hell of a problem : what do they do with Lisa 's body and how do they stop her friends Tammi -LRB- Nichola Burley -RRB- and Kim -LRB- Jaime Winstone -RRB- from reporting the death to the authorities ? Anyone who remembers LWT 's series Ibiza Uncovered knows exactly how outrageous some Brit girls can be on holiday , and Oliver Blackburn 's first full-length feature merely takes that notion and sails off into the big blue yonder with it : what would happen if a few of these reckless , loose-knickered , booze-soaked slappers bit off more than they could chew ? Blackburn handles the first half of his film brilliantly , the build up to the titular act being thoroughly engrossing , and more than a little debauched , with the girls partaking of a variety of class A drugs before Kim and Lisa go below deck to give three of the four lads a night to remember , in more ways than one . The sex scenes , in particular , are unforgettable , with both girls stripping off for some extremely realistic rumpy pumpy , lusty Lisa taking on two at a time . There 's full frontal nudity from both sexes , and one could easily be forgiven for occasionally thinking that the shagging is for real . Given the daring nature of the movie 's near-the-knuckle sex scenes , it 's all the more surprising then to find that the much touted violence that follows is relatively tame in comparison . I was expecting a total bloodbath , but as events spiral out of control all the gore we get is a stabbing , a death by flare ripped-off from Dead Calm , and a disappointing killing via outboard motor that is n't anywhere near nasty enough . That said , this is still an enjoyable effort overall , and possibly the most shocking film ever named after a spurious sex act -LRB- at least until someone is brave enough to make a film called Munging ! -RRB- .

" # 1 Movie To Avoid This Week -LRB- ... and every week -RRB- ... . Holy crap . It 's not often that a movie comes along that is so morally vacuous that it approaches a level of violent stupidity so intricately bad that it is absolutely not enjoyable on any level . But when it does happen , and it has happened with this movie , it makes my job seem incredibly difficult because I have to sit here and try to write a professional film review when I know without a shadow of a doubt that three simple words would suffice - DO N'T WATCH IT . But if you would like to know why , please continue reading . First of all , let 's brainstorm about what makes a violent thriller entertaining , shall we ? You need to have an engaging story , something that moves at a brisk pace and maintains interest without relying on the violence to push it along . You need to have not only believable characters but characters that we care enough about to invest our emotions in their well - being , and you need to have a catalyst operating beneath the surface that drives the characters on screen to commit whatever violent acts take place in the movie . Donkey Punch has none of these . Not even a little bit . There is , of course , a lot to be said about violence in the movies . Some say there 's too much , some say movies are movies and no movie violence is going to change who people are or entice people to commit violent acts , and some people are just violent movie-hounds and can never get enough . Whatever your personal opinion , I tend to think that we can all agree that at the very least , movie violence should have a point , right ? Not this movie . Donkey Punch gives us a film populated with morons , perverts , rapists and idiot college girls , not a single character worth a scrap of thought or interest , and then asks us to care when they start killing each other off . A group of college-girls meet a group of college-age guys at a European resort and , hungry for some adventure stories to take home from their European vacation , immediately accept a shady offer to come touring the Mediterranean Sea on a luxurious yacht to which one of them happens to have access . Anyone with two brain cells working at the same time would have hesitated for at least a few seconds before accepting such an offer from a bunch of crusty guys like these , but no matter . If nothing else , the immediacy of the acceptance will pretty quickly and thoroughly paint the picture of what the rest of the movie is going to be like . Everyone wants to have sex with everyone else , and while taking turns with the blonde not far into the movie in a drug-crazed orgy , when one guy convinces another guy to try out a little sex move called the `` donkey punch . '' I wo n't waste your time explaining what it is . It does n't matter , it 's just a plot device needed to supply the cast with a dead body so that they can spend the rest of the movie killing each other off as they struggle to figure out who can be trusted and who should just be killed . There is not a scrap of realism in the movie , not an iota of clever dialogue or impressive acting , and the by-the-numbers ending does nothing to boost the mood of genuine depression that permeates the entire movie . This thing is a waste in pretty much every way imaginable . Avoid it . " ,2
" Wonderful exploration of teenage minds . 3 girls meet a group of guys in a club whilst on holiday . The guys take them onto their yacht where a terrible accident during sex causes suspicion and tension amongst them . 28 Days Later and its sequel 28 weeks proved Britain can do horror with their sharp representation of zombies and fast styled thrilling action and devastating ratio of death in context of the country 's population . Donkey Punch further promotes the dramatic concept of death by encoding 7 teens and stylizing the idea on what should be a fun filled experience . Opening with three young girls on holiday and looking to explore the local bars and such may be ordinary but the minimal dialogue and the focus on the settings helps differ from convention and achieves a high realism . Many films promote all the dialogue as essential but this 2008 picture gives all realism in account of the story 's context , if occasionally predictable . Drugs , sex , drama , this is n't as Skins as it would hope . The blood thirsty side of the narrative places it more into horror , but then there is not nearly enough action to posses such a genre . This is a psychological drama filled with teens living their lives in a fun filled manner we have expected thanks to such films like Kidulthood and TV show Skins . But a drastic turn during sex has everyone 's heads rolling and the film explores human emotions relating to death and how to approach the situation . The drastic turn of events is good , if not as tense and exciting as it had the potential to be . Oliver Blackburn 's stylised direction works wonders and after viewing , I 'm wondering how the direction would have benefited from a faster scripted narrative . The acting is far from brilliant but then this was n't challenged to be an Oscar contender , more a drama promoting the concept of teen violence and lives . No , Donkey Punch gets by on a realistic script . Many critics and reviews I have read seem to dislike the script and the lack of action . Lack of action is more on many levels as it shows this is n't a run of the mill horror thriller concerned with dazzling special effects . Its purpose is to explore mindsets and entertain through its hard decisions and dramatic taste . The vivid sex scenes at the beginning give the film that erotic twist to add the dramatic consequences to the narrative , and well directed , looking extremely real and will have eyebrows raising . Whereas there is a lack of action , Donkey Punch is still a fast flowing thriller that does well exploring the mindset of teenagers , but does n't have the punch to pip Skins " ,8
" The Unrated Bare-Knuckle Version . Donkey Punch is an epic masterpiece along the lines of such classic films as Citizen Kane , Apocalypse Now , and Schindler 's List . Only one kind of movie can hold an audience captive through such an ultimately awesome sex move and turn the movie into Die Hard on a yacht . It is crafted with the mastery of Spielberg , the musical score of John Williams , the heroism of Indiana Jones , the intellect of Good Will Hunting , the ensemble of The Departed and the suspense of Stephen King The movie begins with a bang -LRB- not literally -RRB- . It is fast-paced from the start . Who could have thought 3 dimwitted broads from Britain could have such a fun time in Spain ? They meet their 3 suitors , and find themselves on a yacht doing crazy drugs within the first 20 minutes . as the story unfolds , a classic line is dropped . One that will surely go on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . Have you ever heard of a donkey punch ? Right up there with You had me at hello . Beam me up , Scotty . Luke , I am your father . Things then take a turn toward some sure to be Academy Award nominated performances . I will get to the scene in a sec , but after the donkey punch , this movie is lights out . Speed does n't hold a candle . And John McClain , you take a back seat to some British vixen named Tammi . Blood , violence , mayhem ensues on a nice little yacht . There is action and suspense at every corner , and I must admit I had to cover my eyes at various points . However , there are no plot holes to speak of , and no one does anything remotely retarded that does n't make any sense . I smell a hefty pay raise for the writer . Now , the scene . Think of the sex scene as the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan , only multiply it by infinity . IT IS THAT GOOD ! Probably the best few minutes in the history of Hollywood . I ca n't think of a more favorable scene in any movie I have seen , in porn or not . Hands down electrifying . No joke - if you stick around for enough of the credits , you will see there was a Foreplay Production Crew . That is how intense this scene is . Of course , the donkey punch comes down with the force of a thousand asteroids bashing into a planet . It is a wind-up , smack me down hit . Think of a 19 year old Mike Tyson . The dude knows how to donkey punch . And , alas , women rejoice , they do show penis in the film . Possible sequel titles could include : Donkey Punch 2 - Danza Slap Nation . Donkey Punch vs. the Bucking Bronco Donkey Punch : In Search of the Pearl Necklace Donkey Punch : Steamed in Cleveland Grade : A + for a terrific , terrific plot , wonderful storytelling , hot girls , and for fulfilling my dream and making my final years on this Earth so much more meaningful . It has that profound effect on a person . Only better moments to expect later in life are the my team winning the Superbowl , and maybe my wedding day -LRB- but I do n't see how that day could come close to the joyous 100 min of Donkey Punch -RRB- " ,10
" Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!! . First of all this movie does n't really fit into a horror category but it was very enjoyable for me . The entire movie was good but the number 1 best scene would have to be the group sex orgy scene . THAT WAS FU \* KING GREAT . The girl who got fuc \* ed up the pussy and then the ass by a different guy -LRB- who performs the donkey punch move on her and kills her -RRB- was very fit . It is an intense film . NOt that much bloody violence but it is entertaining . If your someone who wants to see a film with a graphic sex scene -LRB- the group sex orgy scene was one of the best reasons to watch this film -RRB- then this is THE film for you . This film would be a teenagers favorite with the graphic sexual content it contains . 100\/10 for the sex . 8\/10 for the intense atmosphere and 10\/10 for the whole movie together . " ,10
" great . I have no idea why there are no many negative reviews of this quality thriller . It was a great film - particularly so because it is British -LRB- I tend to have low expectations of films coming from the UK -RRB- . I get the sense that the British film industry must rely on good ideas , rather than explosive big budget scenes , and good acting . This film excels in good acting , and good story line \/ idea . It kept me thoroughly entertained and entranced . Sure , there are some similarities with Dead Calm , but it is a film of its own , and I hope to see more like this quality coming the British Industry . I 'm sick to death of those dated , boring and sterile British costume Dramas OR Gangster films . This is a modern British film worth its salt - and glad to see my lottery contribution going to make entertaining films . Some specifics that I really enjoy about British film is that females are equal or just as strong to the male counterparts . Indeed , films should n't even have such a polarity in this day and age , but Hollywood wants to keep up the polarity . I rarely ever see rape scenes in British films , and for this I love them . American films are just rampant with those kinds of scenes ... which is meant to depict weak females or females that need to be rescued by a male ... it 's a theme that is well past its sell by date . It 's old and sick ! The British take on female roles is far more modern , realistic and closer to my comfort level . The reason I mention this is because the sex scene is tasteful though a bit explicit , where BOTH sexes are actually enjoying themselves , and this is a great aspect . I also liked this film because it relies on script writing and not big budget gore scenes . Finally , this film makes me appreciate European style film making far more than I have done . It just has the wonderful human quality , somewhat raw and real . LIKE IT ! " ,8
" Contemporary sexy , violent horror ... great stuff !!!! . Donkey Punch is hugely enjoyable and fresh take at a horror\/slasher genre pic ! The well known format of an attractive group of young adults indulging in partying , sex and drugs and ending up in an almost unbelievable and violent set of circumstances is taken to the extreme in this film . First time director Olly Blackburn and writer David Bloom have obeyed all the rules in making this kind of movie , but in doing so have created a truly original , fresh and sexy film ! When 3 young women form Leeds meet a group of guys on holiday and go back to their yacht , they soon all over indulge in drugs and sex , after a horrific incident in the bedroom , the perfect holiday becomes a nightmare as each character begins to fight for their own survival ... avoiding any cheesy or unnecessary serial killer idea , the film relies on the believable -LRB- if somewhat stereotypical -RRB- characters to deliver the horrific and shocking gore and violence with adds to the enjoyment of the film -LRB- if thats your taste ! -RRB- . the young cast create the perfect ensemble for this film and with the help of the contemporary soundtrack makes this film feel very much fresh for todays young adult audience , yet due to the film 's loyalty to the format of the genre it is in , Donkey Punch should also still be seen as a shocking , violent and sexy -LRB- as what films of this type should aspire to -RRB- slasher\/thriller for time to come . ... in all Donkey Punch delivers everything a viewer would expect form this type of film and a whole lot more ... hugely enjoyable , wonderfully violent , wonderfully sexy . . all with a great soundtrack ... what more could you ask for ???

" The worst of British cinema . `` Donkey Punch '' must have started out as a joke , just like `` Jaws the Revenge '' . But somewhere along the line some idiot thought it was n't such a bad idea after all and miraculously managed to get funding . Shame as `` Donkey Punch '' is devoid of ALL artistic merit -LRB- to paraphrase Bill Hicks -RRB- - it 's simply someone trying to be Guy Ritchie at his worst . The story is simple - a group of chavs do chavvy things - like the title suggests it involves attempted sodomy and punching women -LRB- ha ha ha misogyny is so much fun -RRB- - but like Peter Bergs film `` Very Bad Things '' , things go very wrong . What I can not fathom is why the director Oliver No-Talent has been all over the UK media and is being held up like the next big promising director when it is clear that the guy could n't even direct traffic . What happened to intelligent British cinema - Powell and Pressburger ? Hitchcock ? Nic Roeg ? If the director has some taste he will just give it all up and start working for M S. It will do society a lot of good . " ,1
" Homage to Film-Noir . While watching `` The Big Sleep '' in a room in Daily Planet , Chloe and Jimmy hear a shot and they find Lana severely wounded in the elevator and a man running upstairs . Jimmy takes a picture of the man with his cellular , and after downloading the image to the computer , he is hit in his head and faints . He dreams with a weird situation in 1940 , with his acquaintances living characters of a film-noir with Lana Lang performing a Machiavellian femme fatale . Meanwhile Lois steals a silver cigarette case with a Gardenia from the crime scene with evidences of a mysterious encounter of Lex with an American senator . Lana discloses to Chloe that she married Lex to protect Clark . I am a fan of film-noir ; therefore I liked this episode , actually a great homage to this genre . The story in 1940 is stylish and better than the plot of the episode . The ambiguous Lionel Luthor shows again the reason why Lex is so evil . My vote is eight . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : `` Mulher Misteriosa '' -LRB- `` Mysterious Woman '' -RRB- " ,8
" While investigating a murder , Jimmy finds himself in an unfamiliar world ! . This episode reminds me a lot of some episodes of Charmed . One : In `` Sense and Sense Ability '' Paige sings `` Fever '' up on stage at P3 to her boyfriend in a smoky environment and in a loose-fitting red , satin dress with the sides of her hair clipped back and it all hanging over one shoulder with loose curls in her hair . And in `` Charmed Noir '' Paige and Brody are sucked into a book to solve a mystery . When the book 's scenes are filmed they appear in black and white and it 's set in the 40s\/60s . In this episode Chloe and Jimmy find the contents of Lana 's bag scattered on the floor in front of the elevator . Lipstick , mascara , an ivory clasp and her keys among others . Jimmy wakes up and finds out that the world 's amiss : he and Clark are budding reporters -LRB- Jimmy 's more confused than anything else ! -RRB- at the Daily Planet ; Chloe 's the boss ; Lionel Luthor owns The Talon Club ; Lex Luthor is a tycoon and Lana Luthor is a femme fatal-e . Lana comes to Jimmy to ask him to investigate or reveal why her husband is going out late at night . Before she disappears back to the Luthor Mansion she gives him a clasp containing cash and matches . This leads him to The Talon Club where he finds Clark , Lionel and , surprise surprise , Lex . A woman dressed in a white dress comes slinking down the stairs starting to sing a song . Lois Lane . Lionel tells him that Lex likes to make a big exit . He 's not one to go quietly and meets his taxi . There 's just one thing , though . He only goes to meet the taxi , not to get into it ! He hides until his bodyguards and look-alike drive off and then quickly hops into another car to drive somewhere else . Jimmy follows Lex to the Kent Farm and sees that the only reason Lex makes a grand exit is so someone in particular will notice . He goes to the Kent Farm to meet none other than Lois Lane , the sultry torch singer . He takes a photo and shows it to Mrs. Luthor and reveals that he 's the one who wants her dead . Lana gives Jimmy a gun , who goes to confront Lex . When Lex reaches into his jacket to get something Jimmy assumes it 's a gun and quickly kills the man . Before Lex dies he finishes pulling out the object : another clasp ! Jimmy wakes up and Lana 's in hospital . Jimmy reveals Lex may have reason to kill her but Clark has other ideas . It 's not the best episode I 've every seen , but it 's very entertaining , even though it 's a bit predictable and corny . It cuts too close to real life in Smallville and the original story line . The only thing that 's different is that Lois is a sultry lounge\/jazz singer , Lionel runs his own bar -LRB- which he owns in real Smallville life -RRB- and Lex has an affair , trying to kill Lana . But who knows if he 's trying to do that in real Smallville life , anyway . It 's all in the air . So , I give this episode a 9\/10 because of it 's entertainment and how fine cut it is . Jimmy ca n't put all the pieces together and see that Clark really does lead a double life . It 's also a bit of fun . It 'd be better if it did n't cut finely to real life in Smallville . It 'd be nice if Clark was made out to be the villain and Lex and Lionel were good guys trying to save the world . Then again , Red Kryptonyte really does that -LRB- turn Clark into a bad-boy , see season 3 's `` Exile '' -RRB- , does n't it ? " ,9
" Its not the idea that makes an episode popular , its the execution . . Sometimes television shows like to branch out , become adventurous and do something outside the realm of what could be considered television normality . For example , live shows , real-time episodes , prequels , flashback shows , the infamous clips show and so forth . It would seem that one of the writers at Smallville thought that it would be a great idea to do an homage to the noir films of the 40s and 50s , The Big Sleep being heavily referenced at the start of this episode . However what this writer failed to comprehend is that for a concept show to work you need one important thing , namely a plot , to make the episode memorable . Its not the idea that makes an episode popular , its the execution . The action begins when Chloe and Jimmy Olsen decide to have a romantic evening in at the Daily Planet offices , when suddenly a gunshot goes off and they find Lana Lang in the lift unconscious , clearly the victim of a shooting . I 'm sorry to say that the wound did not prove fatal . Whilst investigating the photos of the crime scene Jimmy Olsen is knocked unconscious . Suddenly we enter Jimmy Olsen 's dream like state and everything has gone 1940s on us . All the Smallville regulars are their of course , Lois being paraded around as mild titillation , Lionel being his usual ambivalent self and Clark Kent as a timid reporter who happens to be an undercover cop . Oh the irony nearly killed me there . Anyhow what follows is what could be considered the staple of a noir story ; the dame in distress , a car chase , a murder , the inevitable double cross , all lovingly prepared with a smattering of 40s dialogue . 25 minutes later and Jimmy is awake once more . So what does Jimmy 's dream contribute to the story ? Well quite simply he realizes that the cigarette case at the crime scene might prove a vital clue , seeing as Lana does not smoke . Now this may well have been somewhat shocking to the viewer if it were not for one problem ; the writers had already drawn attention to said cigarette case earlier in the episode by having Lois steal it from the crime scene . Already the viewer is expecting something to come of the cigarette case clue before the noir action starts , so ultimately Jimmy 's coma-induced fantasy reveals nothing we were not expecting . The homage , whilst being a nice idea , serves nothing to the story and feels like it was placed in there simply because one of the writers has a soft spot for the work of Howard Hawks . Of course I would also suggest that with 4 episodes left the writers realized they had very little material with which to use at the end of the season , so they needed something to pad the story out . So with 3 episodes now left it seems that the inevitable end of season cliffhanger is going to be squeezed into the last three episodes . One brief mention of Project Ares , Lex 's latest evil scheme , ensured the show contributed something to the end of season story arc , yet apart from that it was an episode that had no place in the last few episodes of this season . " ,2
" Noir . I do n't mind when a show goes off formula and does a theme episode like this , but I believe for one it has to be relevant , and second it needs to have a really good plot to make it work . Noir is a fun idea , and the black and white film noir dream sequence was entertaining enough . The real problem here is that the placing of it chronologically in the season was all wrong , and the plot in the real world that the dream is based on hardly seems relevant . For the placing of the episode , I think this would have been less frustrating earlier in the season . Season 6 started off really weak , and was just picking up a lot of steam in the 2nd half of the season . With Noir airing as the 3rd last episode , right in the middle of all the mystery and tension leading to the finale , it kind of kills the excitement leading to the finale . I have no problem with a stand alone episode like this , made just for fun , but not this close to the end of the season . Now as for the plot , it really seems like the entire black and white dream sequence was written first , and the opening and closing scenes feel very irrelevant . It 's almost like they created the film noir plot to stand all on it 's own , and then at the last minute said We need to come up with some real world plot to tie into this . Who cares how lame or forced it is , just stick it on the beginning and end Still this has some fun moments , and is an amusing concept . I just wish more time had been spent working a half decent plot out . " ,7
" great episode , very original , so stop hating !!! . Why have I just seen a 5.9 out of 10 rating on IMDb ? i mean seriously , whats going on . Did you ever expect smallville to be set in a noir film ? no you did n't ! everything flowed so nicely in this episode , jeannot sharc has yet surprised me again . Not only is this the most original smallville episode since relic -LRB- seaoson 3 -RRB- but its by far one of the best . My brother was raving on about how bad this episode looked in the trailer , and that it had no hope of success what so ever . Well he still thinks that even after the episode . but come on , the only reason a lot of users hated it , was simply because they hated the idea of a Casablanca style smallville episode . Its a change of pace guys , its not something you would normally see in smallville . this is what its all about !!! what exactly people want from an episode from what i see is ; 1 . Clark wearing the same clothes every day 2 . his relationship with Lana and the triangle between them and lex 3 . Clark using his powers 4 . Clark stopping a bad guy NO NO NO NOO !!! TOO Repetitive !! Enough said , this is different , and different is good . SO STOP HATING !!! 9 out of 10 " ,9
" i hope you are patient with diversions . I had high hopes for this episode for about five seconds . Then Jimmy Olson showed up and started mouthing the words to some film-noir movie like a lonely nerd and then Lana was found lying on the floor of an elevator with a bullet hole in her chest . Lana being shot is , at face value , wonderful . Maybe she will die ! Unfortunately , we all know she will live . But what really takes this episode to the limit is the transition into film-noir parody . Or homage ? Jimmy gets hit in the head and suddenly the episode is a film-noir dream that 's running inside Jimmy 's unconscious head . There are a lot of things this show needs . An entire episode that plays out inside Jimmy 's head is not one of them . A heavy focus on Jimmy is bad enough , but a heavy focus on Jimmy in a completely irrelevant side story that takes an entire episode ? That 's an insult . The only redeeming aspect of Jimmy 's dream is Clark Kent 's secret identity as a suave man about town . Also the car chase . The car chase was fun . Jimmy 's subconscious was very committed to accurate cinematography of the film-noir era . " ,4
" Very intense thriller . With a few situations similar to the Silence of the Lamb ; LA CHAMBRE DES MORTS is able to become a complete different and original thriller . Two men hit with a car a person -LRB- and kill him -RRB- carrying a bag full of money . They take the money and dispose the body however that money was the ransom for a kidnapped girl who is murdered . Another girl , a diabetic one , is kidnapped so a police woman and her partner follow the case . The story follows different directions ; the two men who stole the money , the kidnappers , the police and even the kidnapped girl in a brief escape attempt to cross paths near the end . The investigation in itself is realistically resolved ; which somewhat drags the first half of the movie . During the second half , several very intense situations raise the tension towards a final act , somewhat similar -LRB- but far from equal -RRB- to the Jonathan Demme 's film . Melanie Laurent , gives an interesting performance as the single mother of two babies ' police woman ; trying to take care of her siblings while trying to find the killers . While the rest of the cast keeps the level above average . It is important to note that while the gore and violence level are not high ; some situations and images are very intense . The movie was rated OVER 12 YEARS OLD in France ; which is something like an R here in USA . " ,8
" An excellent thriller . I completely disagree with the comment made by the person from UAE . I 'm not generally a fan of the horror\/thriller genre , but since this a French film , I was willing to give it a shot . It far exceeded my expectations . I 'm not going to say anything about the film 's plot , because this is one of those movies to see when you do n't know anything about it . I 'm just going to say that a smart , small distributor should pick this movie up for distribution here in the U.S. I would suggest a title change for the U.S. from the unfortunate `` Melody 's Smile . '' Why not use the literal translation from the original French title , which is `` The Room of the Dead '' ? The audience I saw this with in Los Angeles at COL-COA this week was very enthusiastic . This movie is so much better than the by-the-numbers horror thrillers that so many U.S. movie makers crank out . This movie is genuinely creepy and scary . " ,9
" A wickedly intense thriller . . Horrible title for an amazing film . It 's drawn a lot of comparisons to The Silence of the Lambs , which makes sense since it was obviously inspired by it -LRB- there 's even a little nod to it with the main character having the novel on her bookshelf -RRB- ; the bleak and unrelenting tone as a backdrop for a story with a strong but tortured female detective hunting a killer . But the film should n't be dismissed as a rip-off or anything close ; it 's a fantastic journey into the darkness with a strong performance to bring you in . The story has an interesting approach in bringing us into the world , with a drunk driving incident being the catalyst for a murder and thus bringing the police force into it all . Unlike most tales of this nature though , we get a lot of focus into many different subplots involving a romantic relationship , the struggle of the men driving the car responsible for a murder and ultimately into the mind of the killer themselves . It gets a little cluttered in the middle with all of these strains going on , but ultimately it boils back down to a fascinating thriller with great characters and a powerful lead performance . Melanie Laurent is absolutely dynamite here , portraying the lead with a tortured soul and a strong surface front . She always has you focused on her , studying her expressions and being right with her through every emotion she faces . This is a gripping and very bleak mystery that keeps your mind racing along with your pulse ; the final fifteen minutes are some of the most intense I 've seen in some time . Definitely an underrated hit . " ,8
" Solid thriller . As already noticed by other reviewers , this a french homagge to Silence of the lambs , to make things perfectly clear one of the main characters in the film even picks up the Thomas Harris book . It has its problems : pacing is uneven , some scenes drag quite a bit and there are some holes in the plot but when everything is added this is a pretty solid effort whit some interesting ideas and great , lyrical ending . Actors are all very good , even in the smallest of parts -LRB- the zoo owner was great -RRB- . Directon is stylish and camera work impressive at times . Although the script is n't all that original it does elaborate some great twists and psychological insight . It merits one viewing , 7\/10 . " ,7
" boring . I 've had the chance to see this movie yesterday in Paris before I leave . From the trailer , I thought it 's worth seeing as it looks like a good thriller\/horror film . But I was so disappointed . The story line is somehow predictable . It lacks originality and you can easily compare it to a masterpiece of cinema -LRB- i 'm not gon na mention the name , but i 'm pretty sure you 'll guess it -RRB- . As for the cast , I think they were over-acting here and there , maybe due to the weak script and the empty moments where they look like not knowing what to fill the scene with . But hey , not everything is bad , you 'll enjoy some good cinematography in some scenes , specially in the beginning . Unfortunately , i think it 's a missed opportunity and as we say in french : Dommage , c'est rat ! " ,3
" This is why it is called the `` boob tube '' . Last night the Fox Television Network premiered a new scripted\/reality hybrid series that asks the question : `` Would you trust a bikini model to deliver the news ? '' Dumb question . Just take a look at this anchorwoman 's chest and you will see what `` fair '' and `` balanced '' really means . Lauren Jones plays herself as the breathtakingly beautiful and buxom bimbo who is hired by a Tyler , Texas TV station to increase ratings . A former `` Barker Beauty '' on THE PRICE IS RIGHT and a featured WWE Diva , Ms. Jones is the hottest thing on the boob tube since Pamela Lee Anderson . Guys -- if you are looking for a high-def hard-on , ANCHORWOMAN is the place to be . Virtually the entire cast is comprised of the actual KYTX-TV news staff whose reaction to the hiring of Lauren is mixed at best . This includes , of course , Stormy the Weather Dog whose wardrobe helps deliver the forecast . Stormy and staff are remarkably solid in their on-camera performances and the cinema verite style of Director Mark S. Jacobs adds an air of credibility to the proceedings . During the thirty days of production this broadcast news stunt resulted in six half-hour episodes , with the first two airing back-to-back . You might ask , `` What 's next ? '' So far there has been no word whether ANCHORWOMAN will be renewed . If not , I do have a suggestion . How about going one step farther and replacing Greta Van Susteren with Penny Pittman ? -LRB- See CHATTERBOX , 1977 -RRB- " ,8
" I liked this reality show . ANCHORWOMAN is a reality TV series showing what happens when a small Texas television station wanting to increase its ratings hires Lauren Jones , a stunningly beautiful bikini model , to report the news . People want to know , does ANCHORWOMAN show life as it really is ? The answer is YES ! Right or wrong , in the first two episodes of ANCHORWOMAN , reality is what we see . ANCHORWOMAN shows the grown-up world as it really is . The males `` light up like a Christmas tree '' when a stunningly beautiful female is in the room . More energy . More smiles . More laughter . ALL of the heterosexual males act different including the big bosses . If an average looking female enters the room , the big bosses remain glued to their chairs and their facial expressions and energy level are unchanged . Night and day . I have worked at offices with male bosses , average looking female workers and some stunningly attractive female workers and have seen it all a thousand times . ANCHORWOMAN is real life . Average looking females will sometimes come up with some great winning ideas , but they still do n't receive a show of personal energy from the male bosses . Worse , the average females see it when a stunning beauty comes in with a smaller accomplishment such as , `` I found the missing box of paper clips , '' and then receive the smiles and personal energy . Stunning supermodels have a slightly privileged , over-confident type personality . We see that too in ANCHORWOMAN -- a show that puts the REAL in reality . " ,8
" Anchorwoman a waste of electromagnetic waves . This show is about putting a person into a job that she does not have the basic requisite skills to perform properly . In particular , Lauren Jones , a former Miss New York , is assigned to a job as an anchorman at a struggling Texas television station . She has no training with television or production equipment , or with doing news broadcasts . Such a concept may work in a scripted fiction show as there would typically be a reason why the person has to try to sustain the appearance of competence , and there would be humorous situations and dialog built in . However , it does not work with a reality show , as comments and situations as those that make the TV series `` The Office '' or the movie `` Anchorman '' amusing would -LRB- usually -RRB- never be made by real people in real jobs . The idiocy in Anchorwoman is incredibly predictable and not at all entertaining . We all deal with inept people at work , and it is frustrating , not funny . As an analog , how amusing would it be to watch someone technologically illiterate be put in the job of a network administrator where he had to call the boss to bail him out for even basic tasks ? This is absolutely the worst show I ever saw . The genre was listed as comedy and reality . Comedy is supposed to be funny and reality is supposed to be riveting ; this show was neither . Very quickly I did n't find it entertaining -LRB- the initial allure of Lauren Jones ' looks wore off rather fast -RRB- , but since it was the premier episode I decided I would give it a chance and stick with the show for the entire half hour . Unfortunately , when 30 minutes was up , there were no final credits , and a quick info check on the TiVo revealed the show was actually a full hour . I rarely do this , but with Anchorwoman I decided I could not force myself to sit through another 30 minutes . I changed the channel and did not go back , and I never had any qualms about not finding out how the show ended . Fox made a very wise decision to limit its damage and not air a second episode . " ,1
" Want some cheeeeeseeeee ? . A Love Story is basically the same old trashy filipino soap style movie being serve by Star Cinema . We can see the usual stuff like heavy on dialog , over the top crying scenes , and all those melodramatic clich being thrown into the screen . This movie is all about Ian -LRB- played by Aga Muhlach , acting cute as always -RRB- who have to decide which two chicks his hooking up his going to end up with . Is it the bitch Karyn -LRB- Angelica Panganiban -RRB- or the mature and caring Joanna -LRB- Maricel Soriano -RRB- ? Basically , its a contest between these two lousy women on who gets the grand prize -LRB- Ian the womanizer -RRB- . The story was presented in non-linear and boast itself with a plot twist not common to filipino movies . Unfortunately , the direction was gawd awful its messy and confusing . The scene editing was horrible you get lost between transitions to different location and time . All sorts of supporting casts appears right at you ... you just unable to keep up knowing each one of them . The problem with this movie is that we really do n't care about the characters we are seeing . It does n't show the true values of a filipino . Like Karyn for example , mind you ... a woman who met a guy in the elevator then ends up having sex on the same night will always be a woman of bad reputation in Christian Philippines . Then there 's this Ian who broke his leg on a pathetic skiing stunt who cries like a girl eventually going gaga over Laura because she was the one nursing him till he gets well . Its unbelievable ... and when they finally reveal the over hype twist in the story , I 'd say oh yeah ... big deal . " ,1
" An insult to the intelligence of modern Filipino viewers . Lower your IQ to 3 when watching this movie . . I watched this movie with not much expectations . I 've been let down several times by most Tagalog movies that it 's hard to expect too much . So with an open mind , I watched this movie with a friend . And boy were we in for a real disappointment . Before I start ranting , credit must be given to where it is due . The over all look of the movie is not bad . Like almost all recent Filipino movies , this movie also looked expensive . The cinematography and editing were good , the direction was average and the acting were good given the material that the actors had to work with . Aga 's portrayal of Ian 's character was moving in a sense that I 'm sure Filipino yuppies were able to identify with him . Maricel 's -LRB- Joana -RRB- portrayal was her usual drama . Nothing spectacular . Angelica -LRB- Karyn -RRB- is a pretty face but she could not cry to save her life . What irked me the most , aside from the musical score , was the plot . The basic storyline was a disgrace to the intelligence of women all over the world . Yes , it is a virtue to forgive and forget . Yes , love should conquer all . But balance must also be made with respect to morals and values . This movie patronized how men could conjure up reasons why they would cheat on their spouses or their girlfriends . Unavailability of your partner is not a reason for anyone to go looking for someone else . It may be a reason for a termination of a relationship but definitely not one for cheating - not that there 's any reason to cheat , mind you . Maricel portrayed an intelligent , successful woman who was once betrayed by the man she loved . And then all of a sudden , here she is falling for a married man . That 's illogical . How could someone who have supposedly suffered so much commit the same adulterous mistake once made against her . Though it may happen on real life in the unlikeliest of situations , the writers of the movie failed to create a reasonable impulse on Maricel 's character for the audience to comprehend her actions . In addition to this , in the scene where Joana and Ian first met , the former said : `` pwede ba tayong magpakuha ng stretcher ? '' No self respecting doctor would sound so doubtful in this kind of situation . Aga , on the other hand , played a rich , recently married playboy who has issues with his father . Aga plays the role of a rich playboy so well we almost believe that in real life , he is -LRB- who knows -RRB- . But the problem with this with regard to this movie is that such shallow characterization of Aga 's character failed to utilize Aga 's acting skills . Can he just stop playing cute in each and every movie and be a serious actor soon ? Like in this movie , Ian , who was supposed to have shun his family 's already steady business to make a name for himself appeared to be shallow and immature in his personal life . The writers could have used the character 's pain brought by his dad to their advantage by making Aga 's character deeper , wrought by confusion , racked by guilt and generally logical . But somehow , in their attempt to make the audience sympathize with the character 's betrayal , the writers forgot the actual character . As to Angelica 's character , well a former comment on this was so apt . Karyn 's character was not fully developed , to say the least . Here is a smart guy who has everything in the world going for him who met a pretty girl who is so much younger than him . They slept together and then boom ! They 're married ? How come ? What compelled this elusive bachelor to get hitch with this seemingly loose girl ? Once again , there is no logic here . To be contrite about it , there is simply a lack of progression . The movie seriously underestimates the intelligence of the Filipino audience . Gone are the days when people seem to be satisfied with a happy ending . Loose ends NEED to be tied seamlessly this time . Gone are the days when movie patrons comprise mainly of yayas and manongs . The educated Filipinos are trying to appreciate our film industry . Give us good stories . Give us reasonable tales . Give us a reason to come back . Stop feeding us rehash of old tales . And please , stop advocating male machismo at its worst . It is NEVER okay to cheat on your wives and expect to be forgiven just because you 're sorry . Even if you have a child . Women need to understand that children are not a reason to stay in a marriage . You do n't lose your dignity when you get married . " ,3
" Awful Movie . A Love Story is not your typical Filipino film . It was told in a non - linear fashion and the plot consisted of many ironies but still it is lacking in terms of character development . Aside from that , there was a lot inconsistencies in the lead protagonists and in the plot . I just hope that the scriptwriter should have looked more into the story . There are just too many inconsistencies in the main characters and questions that should be considered about their traits and the story such as the following : 1 . Why would a woman who already suffered from a failed marriage due to adultery would enter an affair and a mature woman and an intelligent one since she works as a doctor ? 2 . Why would an eligible bachelor of who states that he wanted to marry the perfect girl would marry somebody after a one-night stand and a younger , immature and loose woman at that ? 3 . Is it just right that a married person would have an affair because his wife works a stewardess , who is away from the country most of the time and not seeing each other often?The movie stated that they really loved each other that is why they got married?Haven ' t they have they resolved this issue before when they were n't married yet?Also , this problem alone should not be the cause of the man wanting more love.Don ' t we have better communication these days with cell phones , chatting and videocams?I just hope they got more creative with their marriage problems rather than the requirements of the plot alone . 4 . Why does the two woman have to resolve the issue of the affair and not the wife and the husband?Also , why should both women compromise ? I do n't agree that is Filipino culture because they are a lot better than that . 5 . Is having a child just enough reason why a man should just stay with his wife?Shouldn ' t be love be the primary consideration?Again , I do not believe that this Filipino culture alone . 6 . Finally , the most intriguing one.Does the scriptwriter know the difference between DEMENTIA a.k.a Alzheimer 's Disease and AMNESIA ? Apparently , the father of the lead male has signs of amnesia when he could not remember one of his sons.I consider that they did this for dramatic purposes.But it looks fake and unrealistic since the father 's level of dementia has no reason to forget one of his sons.Its either he forgets ALL HIS CHILDREN or BARELY REMEMBERS EACH OF THEM.In his case , he should barely remember each and everyone and NOT FORGET ONE and BARELY REMEMBERS THE OTHERS.If that 's the case , the father should have been stated to have BOTH amnesia and dementia.LOL Again , I just hope that the scriptwriter should have looked more into the story . The actors were alright . Aga Muhlach remains stereotyped in handsome roles which he portrays best.LOL Maricel Soriano never fails to deliver . While Angelica Panganiban is a sexy but so-so actress . LOL Nevertheless , this film does not fall short in entertainment as far as being a drama is concerned . " ,4
" Absurdly fascinating ... . Finally , a mainstream Filipino flick that experiments with non-linear storytelling , uses an excellent cast -LRB- not reliant on the upcoming star of the moment -RRB- , and does n't insult the moviegoers ' intelligence with overly explicit explanations . Direk Maryo J. de los Reyes does an excellent job with A Love Story : the plot is complex enough to hold a more discerning audience 's attention . The sound engineering was consistently solid , the wardrobe and make-up were expressive of the characters ' personalities , and the acting was mostly spot-on . The cinematography is subtly symbolic , thoughtful and well-motivated . The first establishing shot is a bird 's - eye view of the Alabang Town Center fountain , done ala Gaudi with fragmented tile pieces , foreshadowing the movie 's theme of broken relationships , and ends with the lead characters walking over a rocky shore . Ian Montes -LRB- played to the hilt by Aga Muhlach -RRB- is the classic Pinoy male who feels he 's God 's gift to women ; unlike most men of this strutting ilk , at least he comes equipped with dimples , a well-maintained bod and makes oodles of money . Joanna -LRB- sympathetically performed by Maricel Soriano -RRB- is the doctor who finds new love in Ian after recuperating from a cheating husband and showers him with attention . Karyn -LRB- believably portrayed by Angelica Panganiban -RRB- is the stewardess that Ian is drawn to because of her youthful spontaneity . The characters are complex and offer facets the audience can relate to . Absurdly fascinating yet true is how these independent , strong-willed women are reduced to mindless martyrs whenever the object of their affection throws another testosterone-filled tantrum . What is ridiculous is while both women are shown to have depth beyond their looks -LRB- which is supposed to complicate the choice further -RRB- ; there is nothing beyond the superficial that Ian offers other than what is apparently great sex . His father 's words of wisdom apparently did not impress upon him : Flowers are like women ; do not pick a flower if you will just throw it away . You have to take care of it because there will never be another one like it again . There is nothing more satisfying than right triumphing over wrong , no matter how difficult . Those who indulge in adultery really set themselves up for inevitable pain . This is really a good example of while we all have a choice , it takes two to tango ! All in all , a good movie , but if I had to nitpick , I 'd change the title -LRB- why in English ? And why so plain and non-descript ? -RRB- . Some of the supporting cast could 've been reconsidered because they were painful to watch -LRB- Karyn 's bestfriend\/fellow stewardess was OA , Karyn 's OB-Gyne and her son Jacob were also camera-conscious -RRB- , some minor technical flaws -LRB- what must be a handsfree microphone set is visibly tucked behind Maricel 's jeans ; the reflection of the hand holding the non-glare shield is visible on the windshield in the scene where Karyn is sitting in her car -RRB- . Also , cut out the draggy parts and reshoot some of Angelica 's speaking lines in English because they distract from the dialogue . And okay , rehashing the Joey Albert song `` Tell Me '' is cheesy with literal lyrics as a compromise-trademark of Filipino films , which could 've been tolerated except whenever it played in the movie and the lady beside me would burst into heartfelt song . Each time ! " ,9
" Outstanding Movie . I saw this movie last night on DVD for some reason , I lost tract with the civilization that I do n't have an idea that this movie exists nor what it 's all about , so I made it a try . The movie is all about Ian Montes , played by Aga Muhlach , along with all his love interest , Dr. Joanna Villanueva played by Maricel Soriano and the 22 year old flight attendant Karyl played by Angelica Panganiban . Sounds very interesting right ? How could you go wrong with the comparison of a 22 year old flight crew with an doctor . Aga Muchlach , as always , perhaps , the only Filipino actors who proves the Einstein theory that time does n't exists . He does n't aged a bit , he can portray any genre or character , he can convince everybody that he is either 25 or 45 and living you without any doubt . The way the movie goes was very interesting , something that has n't been done before , its a very new way for the Filipino audience , I 'm sure a lot of the movie goer could be confuse for some part cause director Mario J delos Reyes made it in a way that you will hold your seat and wait what gon na happen , so it 's kinda tragic and not the usual Filipino movie that you would hope the ending will be . It is a slow start , I could really tell that hey had difficult time introduced the character , but it went very well , everybody at their age might get relate with them or somehow get the sympathy of the characters cause they portrayed it very well ... and oh yeah it has twist ... In general , I love the movie , I love the story , I love the characters , I totally recommend it to watch it . " ,9
" A Love Story ? Do you have an idea how recyclable this title is ? =-RRB- . I just seen this movie and from what I saw , the only thing I could say is that it had a very good idea behind it . Unfortunately , they lack important details such as how Karyn -LRB- Panganiban -RRB- and Ian 's -LRB- Mulach -RRB- relationship ever blossomed . I mean , sure they showed how they met , and how they ended up in bed , but where 's the middle part ? It 's like sex without foreplay . Yeah , Just straight to orgasm . But then again , what the hell do I know about that stuff . Anyway , back to my point . The concept of having the audience think that the mistress was the wife and vice-versa was very well planned . It had the potential to be one of the most unforgettable movies of all time ; However , because of the lack of support for each of the character 's background , the movie ended up just as a one-time thing . You watch it , you forget it . Period . I am aware , though , that they deliberately intended for the audience to start hating Karyn , given the way that she was exposed slowly to the viewers , but a little more detail could not have hurt . As for the sympathy for the characters , there was not much . The only dominant feeling throughout the movie was the growing hate for the character of Aga . He was flat and boring AND annoying . The little screen time Angelica had gave even more growth as a person , and insight to the expecting viewers . Maricel 's character showed development too , but I did n't think that she would 've done the same thing that happened to her to another person . There 's trauma , yes , but that was just plain evil . Who makes people hurt the way they did ? All in all , I would still recommend A Love Story to most people . Especially if you 're Filipino.Though not very lengthy , it still had parts where you just get lost thinking with the characters as you watch them , possibly even share the feeling that they had at the time . I ca n't deny that it did have it 's moments , it 's just that they were n't very unforgettable . Again , good idea , could-be-way-better depiction . " ,7
" Outstanding Tear-Jerker Movie ! Highly Recommended ! . August 22nd was the first -LRB- and only -RRB- time my wife and I could watch this movie because of her hectic work schedule at the local Cable TV company . We watched this movie at SM Megamall in Philippines . Her officemates already watched this movie before her and I watched it , last night . Normally , I do n't have tears during movies because I try to hide my emotions , but this movie had brought back memories for me , considering I 've had many sour relationships , but I was n't a playboy as what Aga Mulach played as Ian Montes . I 'm a American Citizen and Filipino Mestiso -LRB- my dad was natively born in Philippines -RRB- and I -LRB- finally -RRB- got married to my wife in October 2006 . -- Fortunately or unfortunately , I was n't as lucky as Ian was in the movie . In many of the scenes , such as when Ian -LRB- Aga Mulach -RRB- and Karyn -LRB- Angelica Panganiban -RRB- were arguing after Karyn was at a party with her friends , my wife kept nudging me . Many of the things that Ian had said were , either the same or similar , to what I 've said to my wife , but in very different circumstances , but mostly were at the start of my marriage and not currently . Ian said something similar to , `` I need my wife ... but you 're never around . '' I remember saying that to my wife , more than once . I admit that . High technology was not in this movie , with the minor exception of mobile phones and text messaging . I did n't see an internet connection , such as internet chat or e-mail being used or emphasized . The movie contained Motorola and Nokia cellphones , but no PDAs -LRB- such as Palm Pilots , Blackberries , etc. -RRB- , as seen in other Love Drama stories . Angelica Panganiban , acting as Karyn Torres , plays an immature part of the movie . She claims to be 22 years old , and my wife both agree that she is too young to have any real relationships . Her job as a flight attendant signifies that she has not decided what her future is going to be . My wife describes her as `` too wild . '' Her attitude is focused on sex , first , and then relationship , second . -- In the movie , some parts were missing , such as what happened before Karyn and Ian slept together . The plot was missing . It went from meeting for the first time , to sex in bed . And then , meeting in a public place . I was n't sure what Maryo J. De los Reyes -LRB- Director -RRB- wanted in Angelica 's character . Did she want a prostitute that falls in love , or a desperate woman that does not want to work ? I could n't figure that out . Maricel Soriano , acting as Joanna Villanueva , was missing through some very important parts of the movie . There was a lot of missing information about her marriage with Peter -LRB- Mark Gil -RRB- . I guess that was Vanessa Valdez 's -LRB- writer -RRB- idea to add suspense in the movie . I kept asking my wife , questions , because there was too much information missing . Even my wife could not figure out the missing parts . Mark Gil -LRB- Peter -RRB- is a `` person of interest '' to me , since he was in `` Mula Sa Puso . '' He does n't have a Filipino name , yet he is a Filipino TV\/Movie star . For some reason , he keeps his identity a secret , even to IMDb . When I seen him in A Love Story , I did n't recognize him , until he spoke . His Tagalog has unusual accents , maybe mixed with non-Filipino dialects . Most Filipinos do n't notice that . His part in this movie should have been a lot more than just a few short scenes . From my perspective , he looks like he was just `` planted '' to fill in the roll of Peter . He was talked during many parts of the movie , but his acting just was n't there . Aga Muhlach -LRB- Ian Montes -RRB- wore a plain Cross neck-less throughout the movie , but there was no Christian\/Catholic events in the movie . His character shows that his cross is for show-only , not for any religious conviction . I was expecting Maricel Soriano to have a church scene , such as in `` Paraiso : Tatlong kwento ng pag-asa '' , but I did n't see one in the movie . I 'm not sure if this was done to allow persons from all religions to watch the movie or not . The movie missed adding any Wedding Scenes . In nearly all Filipino love story movies , a wedding scene -LRB- with a priest -RRB- , is part of the movie . The movie emphasized on `` anniversaries '' but there was little or no emphasis on any actual marriage ceremonies . -- I was looking for this in the movie ... Remember the movie and soap opera , Mula Sa Puso ? The movie , `` A Love Story '' , brings out the importance of marriage , or at least , a true relationship . The movie could be nicknamed as , `` Do n't cheat on your spouse or else ! '' It emphasizes events that really do happen but nobody pays any attention to it . In case you have not seen this movie , yet . Please do so , as I highly recommend it . Ladies -LRB- and some guys , too -RRB- , please bring tissue or towel , as this movie will make you cry . " ,10
" The Best Episode Ever - `` Ending Happy '' . This episode has EVERYTHING ! From Milton , the retiree who quotes Longfellow , to a romantic comment between Grissom and Sarah . Who dunnit ? Everyone ! Cause of death ? Everything ! A great guest cast , headed by James Whitmore , does an outstanding job in a super setting . A whorehouse in the desert , populated with old coots , beautiful ladies , an inept local constable , and strung out Happy hisself - one of those characters `` who needed killing . '' If Emmy awards are n't given to the writers , cast , special effects artists - it will really be a CRIME . I really , really need some comic relief , and this episode just made me grin from ear to ear . Thank you , CSI producers - this was the best of the best . " ,10
" She 's grown up . -LRB- No real spoiler but hints at the direction of the episode . -RRB- I have to agree with the statements that that this was one of the best episodes this season . The constant redirection , the outrageous things done to the boxer , not to mention the whole `` boxer trains at a brothel '' idea are some of the most creative of the season . I really like the continuity of this season . Events and plot lines from previous episodes affect the characters as the season progresses . But every once in a while , you just have to have fun and break away from the formula . It allows both the writers and the actors some freedom from having to continue to answer questions from previous episodes , while still allowing consistent character development . But , to my summary . I wondered where I had seen the actress playing one of the `` pleasure providers . '' I realized she was the daughter in `` What Women Want . '' She has really grown up . EDIT : I just realized where I had seen Doris Babinkian -LRB- the `` madam '' -RRB- : Sister Mary Robert from the Sister Act movies . Talk about growing up ... " ,7
" Ahhh ... James Whitmore . I 've already watched this episode twice , and love it . It 's great to see the creators still know how to have some fun with these characters ... especially the interplay between Brass and Doc Robbins . My favorite , by far , has to be casting James Whitmore -LRB- see also The Shawshank Redemption , Them ! , several episodes of The Twilight Zone , and the narration of Ken Burns ' Lewis Clark documentary , among many other credits -RRB- as the old man no-one takes seriously . I know it 's not the exact line , but when , after completing the `` I Shot an Arrow Into the Air '' poem , Sara tells him to `` Keep the Faith , '' I was almost hoping for her to call him Brooks - again see Shawshank . " ,10
" bad day for a boxer . This was probably one of the best in a long time . I like the miniature killer , but this was way more fun ... if one can say death can be fun . The Devil from Constantine makes a great Pimp . Do n't know who the old Poet or the main Pleasure provider were but they did great . The voice over in the snake scene was very well done . I was touched personally by just a few moments of screen time , Wish I could remember who the actress was . Had a hard time with the `` madam , '' she did well with what she had , winking all that , but I just did n't know quite what to make of her . When I see it again I am sure I will get a lot more out of her work , but the first time through it was tough . She was in probably the best scene in the movie , when they were sampling her DNA , the thing with the cigarette , Magnificent . Over all I got ta say the boxer had a bad day . " ,8
" One Of The Most Entertaining CSI Episodes Ever . This is one of the craziest and most entertaining episodes ever on CSI . Sometimes the Las Vegas CSI show is bent more on humor than it is drama and crime-solving . Sometimes it works ; sometimes it does n't . It dd here , big-time , in the case of an ex-boxer found dead in a pool at a brothel somewhere outside Las Vegas . Man , this guy was hard to kill ! How he 's killed turns out to be an outrageous series of events . I 'll say one thing for the victim : he was one tough dude ! Meanwhile , every time `` Lt. Brass '' thinks he 's solved the case , `` Doc Robbins '' has bad news for him . `` Doc '' keeps finding out new ways the boxer became a corpse . The autopsy keeps changing and it gets very comical . Robert David Hall -LRB- `` Doc '' -RRB- is always good as the medical examiner . I do n't know how much `` fame '' he gets from this role , but it 's not enough . He 's really fascinating , every time he 's on screen . Another guy is just tremendous in this particular show -LRB- and all of them are , for that matter -RRB- is Paul Guilfoyle as the above-mentioned `` Brass . '' I 'm telling you , Guilfoyle and Hall proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are great comedic actors , not just actors in general . These guys had me laughing out loud several times each during this episode . As for the guest stars , Peter Stormare , who has slowly blossomed into a film star after his role in `` Fargo , '' is entertaining , as always . In this story , he 's `` Binky Babinkian . '' Wendy Makkena is equally entertaining as Binky 's wife `` Doris . '' It 's hard to imagine she was once `` Sister Mary Robert '' in `` Sister Act . '' She was cute then , and she 's still a very pretty woman ... and a good actress . She and Stormare are hilarious in this episode . All the characters over-the-top and fun to watch . You can add Vince Lieluf as `` Connor Foster , '' the goofy bartender , to that group . It also was great to see James Whitmore again . He plays `` Milton . '' I ca n't believe the 87-year-old still is acting . Good for him . There is a wonderful scene with he and Jorja Fox -LRB- `` Sara Sidle '' -RRB- reciting Longfellow . I see by his resume here that he had n't acted for four years until this little part , and has n't acted since . It was a pleasure to see him on screen again . " ,10
" Funny :-RRB- . It is one of the funniest episodes of CSI . Full of funny characters , turnarounds , weapons , and even theme song is humorous . Peter Stormare , from Prison break plays Russian accented brothel owner . The whole episode is about one murder . A murder of ex-boxing champion . !!! SPOILER BELOW !!! Many people tried to kill him , with different things : crowbar hit to the head , crossbow shot through the neck , fellatio administering shrimps , injection of a snake venom , but at the end it was not possible to determinate who really killed him . There were three people who tried to kill him . Bartender , brothel owner , and `` pleasure '' worker . Episode locations are Brothel and trailer park outside of city , CSI lab , and interrogation room . 70 % of scenes are at brothel , which is unusual , since most CSIs are usually at lab . Must see ! " ,10
" Still laughing . By far the funniest and my most favorite episode . How often do you see a plot where a has-been boxer dies at a brothel . Doc Robbins calling every time to tell Brass and Grissom the person they thought was the killer was n't it was the best . I hate Brass and seeing him get screwed over and over was great . The dealings with the employees of the brothel is what made it too funny . I wo n't go into details but I 'll mention the major players . First is Binky and Doris , owners of the brothel called the Sugar Cane Ranch . Second is the escort Dreama Little , played by a shockingly grown up and amazingly hot Ashley Johnson , who was little brat on Growing Pains that looked like ` Annie ' . Third is the bartender Connor Foster , previously seen in that role in the episode ` Homebodies ' . Beyond that , the best part had to be all of the fine ladies wearing very little , especially the uber-delicious Marnette Patterson . FYI : She 's Aimee , AKA the one who says the line `` I popped his man-cherry '' . " ,10
" I knew that girl was familiar ! . It amazes me sometimes , how these people can come up with interesting stories and this was one . Do n't ask how many ways to leave your lover , ask how many ways to kill em ' . LOL And not to leave out , one of my most fav character actors , Peter Stormare . . you ca n't have a bad show with him in it . To mcgarras ... I was going out of my mind the first time she was on screen . I knew I knew her and it took me an hour after the show to figure out who I thought she was . I did n't think of What Women Want , my crazy mind went back farther ... I remembered her as a little girl on Growing Pains ! It kills me the things I remember . But , I have to agree , my how she has grown " ,9
" The New Born and the Janitor . Sun tells Jin that she does not trust on the new acquaintances Daniel and Charlotte and she decides to move to Locke 's camp . Juliet discovers her intention and tries to stop Sun telling Jin about her affair . Meanwhile in a flash forward , Sun delivers the baby girl Ji Yeon while Sun insistently seeks a Panda for the new born . Sayid and Desmond are introduced to Captain Gault immediately after the suicide of the crewman Regina in the supply vessel Kahana owned by Charles Widmore ; when they are sent to their new accommodations , they meet the janitor Kevin Johnson responsible for the cleaning of their cabin . Ji Yeon together with Eggtown are the best episodes of the Fourth Season of Lost so far . We see that Sun and her baby survives and , Sun is another name officially included in the list of the Oceanic Six together with Hurley , Kate and Jack , but it is not clear what might have happened with Jin ; but the most intriguing part of the episode is the identity of Ben 's spy on board of the Kahana , Kevin Johnson . The new mystery about Jin is also very interesting in spite of the manipulative flash forward . My vote is nine . Title -LRB- Brazil -RRB- : Not Available Note : On 14 April 2013 , I saw this episode again on DVD . " ,9
" Hmmph ! . I was \* very \* disappointed to see Regina 's -LRB- Zoe Bell -RRB- quick demise . After being taunted with just a voice over a few episodes , we see her for only a few minutes before her character is done in ! I must have read a ton of reviews and the majority agree as well . What a waste of a perfectly good stunt woman . Bring her back ! Sometimes the flash-forwards and flash-backs make the show confusing , but then again that is most likely the lure of the show . It 's like trying to put together a puzzle when all the pieces are the same color . I feel somewhat sorry for Jin , as his IRL circumstances may have contributed to his demise . " ,9
" `` Nice to meet you , Kevin '' . `` Ji Yeon '' is an episode that I would have liked to rate even higher , if Jin 's non-island scenes had been left out . The manipulation of the viewer in this episode is very clever , but also very cruel . Admittedly it is a trick that the series had never attempted before , but I felt that the final twist could have been presented more `` honestly '' -LRB- if that makes sense when we 're talking about a twist -RRB- by including only Sun 's non-island scenes , plus Hurley 's wonderful appearance at the end . `` Ji Yeon '' is certainly one of the most emotional `` Lost '' episodes , and the reconciliation scene with Jin and Sun inside their tent is shatteringly moving . Both Daniel Dae Kim and Yunjin Kim are in top form , and I just ca n't get enough of Yunjin 's expressive face . The other part of this episode , set on the rescue ship , is also surprising and revealing , as Desmond and Sayid meet the captain ... and Kevin Johnson . If the script was n't just SO manipulative , I would give this episode even more than \*\*\* out of 4 stars . " ,8
" Jin 's still alive . Guys , I think you 've got it all wrong . I mean , Jin 's flash backs were n't actually flashbacks , I believe they were flash forwards . Why else would they be mingled with Sun 's flash forwards ? Maybe Sun 's father staged Jin 's death with his help to keep him away from his daughter . I do n't know , but I just think that Jin is n't actually dead . I mean , by now we all know that the oceanic six were actually eight but two of them died during the getting back trip . So maybe those two were Jin and Claire -LRB- that 's why Kate took her baby -RRB- . As for the episode as i whole , I believe it was one of the best episodes of the season . I really liked the fact that sun was going to deliver the baby , although I did n't like the fact that she was a survivor , I 'm not a huge fan . I would rather it 'd been Sawyer . " ,9
" Oceanic 6 assumptions ... along with something you might not have noticed . One of the best of the season so far ! Something you might not have noticed along with the Flashbacks and Flashforwards was that when Hurley came to see Sun near the end , she was once again slim and the baby had hair ... I assume that this was a few months after Sun had the baby . Also ... she convincingly repeated Jin 's name whilst having the baby and did n't sound crazy ! The question now is what happened in the time between the baby was born and the final couple of scenes . My prediction is that Sayid was ordered to kill Jin because he wanted to go back to the island or reveal some of its secrets . Hence , Jin was buried in Korea ! So to conclude ... the oceanic six are POSSIBLY ... Jack , Kate , Sayid -LRB- maybe -RRB- , Hurley , Sun and Jin -LRB- probably -RRB- . The other possibility is Michael ... but if it is him then I 'm surprised why he has n't visited Sun after shes given birth as he got on very well with her ! The reason why I 'm saying MAYBE for Sayid is that maybe he returned to the ` outside world ' through an alternative path with Ben . This seems possible as he was not spotted as being one of the ` Oceanic Six ' in ` The Econimist ' episode ! " ,9
" most ... . you mean most manipulative ? misleading ? keep in mind Jin 's flashbacks served no purpose but to be a red herring they had nothing to do with the story being told , it 's bad writing . They ca n't justify showing that . Try watching the episode again and not getting irritated knowing he 's buying a panda for a stranger . And whats with the children 's comedy music going on during that slapstick scene with the cell phone ? gim me a break ridiculous , waste of LOST-time Hopefully next weeks will be better , and carry us through til April .

" A note giving applause for the movie , the writer and the actors . . I watched the movie tonight and truly loved it . So much so , that when it was over , I looked to see who the author was so I could tell her how much I enjoyed the movie . It was so different , yet so real , and so beautiful . Thank you Julie Brazier for writing this story and whoever made it into a movie for television , thank you too . Also the actors did a wonderful job . The only face I recognized was `` Sarah '' ... but all did an excellent job , including the small parts . As I wrote that sentence I recalled something I was told when I was in my 1st play . There are no small parts , only small actors . This movie had a host of wonderful actors doing a marvelous job portraying a story that really reached out to the viewer . I just wanted to say thanks again . I went on the internet to see if she had written any other movies or maybe a book . I found this site , so I hope word gets to her to let her know how much I enjoyed her movie . " ,10

It takes a while but Sarah finally gets up enough nerve to meet her dreamboat and attends a AA meeting where she ends up sitting next to him . It turns out that the guy that Sarah is in love with , from afar , is Charlie Patterson , Peter Overbridge . Charlie is a recovering alcoholic who 's there at the meeting with his teenage son Kit , Gerald Funk , who 's also in the process of kicking his alcoholism . Having no trouble at all striking up a conversation with the very friendly Charlie Sarah quickly becomes part of his crowd of AA members even though , unknown to Charlie Co. , she has no drinking problem . Concerned about her `` alchoholism '' Charlie as well as his son Kit , who 's mom left him and Charlie when he was two , try to get Sarah off the sauce not knowing that she probably may have an even more acute illness then drinking ; Trying to strike up a relationship with Charlie and his friends by using their sickness , alcoholism , as cover in her being a fellow alcoholic . Toching and effective movie about a lost soul in the wilderness who finds her way back to society by becoming involved with people who have , for the most part , bigger problems then she has . Seeing what recovering alcoholics go through turns Sarah into the kind feeling and giving human being that she abandoned years ago . Always there for her friends when they needed her , in one case preventing a distraught AA member from blowing his brains out , Sarah 's secret in not really being an alcoholic in the end became her own undoing . Charlie who fell madly in love with Sarah and wanted to help her recover is flabbergasted when he finds out the truth and is almost driven back to the bottle because of it ! It takes as much , maybe even more , courage for Sarah to stand up in front of a room full of recovering alcoholics , including her friends , as an alcoholic confronting , in public , his or her alcoholism in Sarah admitting her duplicity in using their addictions to improve her social life . In the end it , by coming clean , turned out to be the best thing that Sarah even did . It not only made her a better person with those that she came to know and love at AA but those , including her little dog Shakespeare and estranged younger sister Olivia -LRB- Sarah Edmondson -RRB- , that she so mistreated and was cold to before she ever go involved with Alcoholics Anonymous .

" A fabulous movie ! . Ordinarily there 's a certain expectation from ` made-for-TV ' movies . This one , with the always-lovely Jennifer Beals , was marvelous . Her beauty and range of emotion ... sometimes carrying scenes with a glance or a facial expression ... tipped the scales for me . The interplay between Sarah and her ` love ' was sweet throughout , and it was beautiful to see a couple 's relationship grow slowly rather than race to a quick end . The final scene , without giving anything away , was just as you 'd like the movie to end . ` Sarah 's ' surrounding cast was fabulous , but Jennifer 's starring role was even more so . Three cheers for the movie , and endless cheers for Jennifer . " ,9
" A lonely woman stumbles into an AA meeting after seeing the group , including a handsome man , gathered outside . . Really heart-warming , charming , and sweet . This movie restored my faith in Lifetime Movie Network . All the actors are the kind of talented where I did n't even notice how good they were -LRB- until I read a previous poster 's comment afterward -RRB- because they just WERE their characters . And all the characters are rounded and not static . They change and go through problems , feelings , conflicts , etc. . It 's really easy to watch and get absorbed in because so much of Sarah -LRB- and others -RRB- is revealed slowly and progressively . You witness the full growth and evolution of her romantic relationship and personal journey . The scenic views of wherever -LRB- Vancouver is where it 's filmed ? -RRB- really add to the setting and ambiance , also . Props to Sarah for going to the pound for a dog instead of a breeder -LRB- this is in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie -RRB- . I do n't know whether men would like it as much as women , but then again , it did air on Lifetime Movie Network . " ,10
" My name is Sarah , and that 's about it . . Might be the worst film I have ever seen.No character development , clich scene heaped upon clich . The main actor -LRB- Jennifer Beale -RRB- seemed afraid to both act or be involved in what was a very limited production.The entire cast consisted of the members of an AA group.Avoid this film at all costs , I sat jaw agape about a 1\/3 through the film.The viewer is unable to connect , or make an emotional investment in the characters due to not being given any background.I was actually surprised at how easy it was to spot the flaws in this film , but they are stark . I would give this film a zero if it was possible . " ,1
" Awesome compilation of random thoughts in the subconscious . The Plot The Protagonist `` K '' is a narcissist , self obsessed chain smoker . But I believe most smokers are narcissist to an extend . So is K , the man who spends hours in the Wash Room , to enjoy the smoke look at his well toned body and enjoy his looks , his style , rebuilding his confidence , by self assuring that `` nobody tells me what to do '' . He takes his life for granted , when he says , no body leaves me . The question of leaving , quitting in his life has to go with his past , where his mother and father split . He is so obsessed with himself , that he is got less time to think about it . A self made cosmopolitan corporate boss , who makes things possible , with out leaving cigarette not even a moment . His name is K , because his name is K , and there is no surname , last name attributes , to add to the fact that he is self made man . His wife Anjali is a woman , who never complained , at last sticks her foot down , and asks him to quit smoking . He is referred to a clinic , Prayog Shala , which has a reputation . K decides to go to the clinic to bring back his estranged wife . He goes down the shabby `` Kalkatta Karpets '' , a shady place where Prayog Shala is located . Bengali Baba , chief there asks him to enroll , or else die . He is got no option but to take it . The conditions put by Baba are simple . If K smokes his first Cigarette after this , his brother who is in hospital will be suffocated with cigarette smoke . Second cigarette , his fingers will be cut off . Next cigarette , his wife will die . As I was leaving from the theater , I could hear viewers puzzled comments on the movie . I am sure , more than half of the crowd did n't understand the movie . Hence writing this . As Anurag said before the release , there is only one key to understand the movie . Anurag has employed the same devices that was always incorporated by likes of David Lynch -LRB- Blue Velevet , Mullholland Drive etc. -RRB- , Martin Scorsese -LRB- After Hours -RRB- , Charlie Kauffman -LRB- Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind , adaptation , being John Malkavitch , etc. -RRB- This film has nothing to do with quitting smoking . But everything to do with quitting any addiction in life . Smoking being one of the worst , yet popular addiction is difficult to kick , because of the availability of cigarettes was just chosen by him . This film is about habits , that has gotten in to us , in the subconscious , which makes us feel we need it . The inner struggle , whether for good or bad . the dream K is having is of Siberia , it represents oppression , a communist rule , where there are no individual liberty . He is the one who believes he is independent and free , and he is made to quit his individual liberty , his dream state just signifies that , the state he is in , the desperation for smoke . He will get killed if he goes for the smoke . \* the Baba is a doctor , there is no Baba , he instead of the usual chemical treatment , treats K psychologically . After all smoking is more a psychological addiction \* the dialog Baba says about Antaratma , is about subconscious . the struggling K we see is his subconscious , what Baba does is he is taming the subconscious , the key factor of individuality and liberty from the mind of a narcissist man , who says , no one teaches me what to do . For that fear in injected in to his mind . \* there are no actual loss of ears , eyes , family , what ever . Those are fears of losing loved ones , harming them , causing harm to oneself , by smoking , there are no accident , but its what he is going through \* there are no Annie , only Anjali . Annie is the guilty feeling that he has in his mind , that if he smokes he will loose her , and also the temptation to smoke . -LRB- to cheat or not to cheat one 's wife -RRB- \* he is forced many times to smoke , and smoking he is made to believe causes harm to his loved ones , that explains the murder of Anjali , suicide of his brother -LRB- he is made to believe that he is the cause of his brothers lung problem -RRB- , etc. . \* the dialog I reached here through bathtub , him though Almari , signifies the subconscious of other people going through the same , similar phase \* the other K inside the that dirty room , trying to reach the original K , is none other than his subconscious trying to reach him , and make him smoke , the dirt signifies many things , the smoking dirt , the suffering he is going through \* remember the announcement `` those who have paid full fees can go for the bath '' . It means the course is complete , where the subconscious is cleaned up \* finally he , the subconscious , is being burnt , and finally K is relieved and treated . \* the cut finger is none other than the fact that , he is missing the smoke in his had , the fingers which are cut are the ones which we use to smoke , so when he finally quit smoking , he is missing those , the only way he can get out of it is to get himself company and relief , which is why he has to enroll another person for the program . 9\/10 . Anurag has has suspended disbelief and played with it , . there are more comments to it , explaining each and every incident , but i believe i just have to give key . please feel free to correct me , if i got any thing wrong . one more thing john Abraham has done a good job , really commendable , for the first time ever . seems all he needed was a good director " ,9
" No Smoking - Welcome to New Age Cinema of Beauty and Class . Throw away the colorful clothes , all the expensive jewellery and welcome to realistic cinema . A theme which is hard to make a movie on , attempted by a writer\/director of many realistic movies like Black Friday and Satya . What appears on the screen is true magic of a director who thinks a different way . A second of this movie can not be missed , a minute is as good as not watching the movie . Put on your thinking caps for a movie . See , visualize , enthrall . This movie is a must-watch for those who love change , who love to think about every scene in the movie and analyze . Commercial ? -- 0 % value . Cinematic Experience ? - 200 % value . It did take me two full times to watch this movie to understand the whole concept of this movie . It did make me think 10 times before I touched my next cigarette . I applaud you Mr Anurag Kashyap . Screw the critics who slammed you . " ,10
" Unbelievable , Classy , Abstract . There is no doubt left in my mind , that Anurag Kashyap is the next big thing in Bollywood . He is probably the best Indian director for a long time , after the great Satyajit Ray . After his controversial debut in the industry with Paanch , and Black Friday , he delivers this classy act with No Smoking . Truth be told , I was a bit skeptical about this film . A few of my friends had already had a glimpse of it and warned me against going for it , but I gave it a shot nonetheless . And I 'm not complaining . No Smoking is not your traditional movie . Its not targeted to be a box office hit , because simply 9\/10 people will find it stupid , boring and curse Mr.Kashyap to be a raving lunatic . But in the truest of sense , there could not have been any better addiction movie than No Smoking . We have had Requiem For a Dream , Trainspotting in Hollywood , but this the first time we have an Indian story to it . True No Smoking is even more abstract than both , but it also follows a complicated theory . One which is iterated by the Guruji -LRB- Paresh Rawal -RRB- of the Hindu knowledge of the soul , consciousness , and the Vedas . What is the basic theme of the movie is that every addiction has its core in the consciousness , the soul and we have to purify the soul in order to rid us of the addiction . The entire movie we are thrown into possibilities where the antagonist , K -LRB- John Abraham -RRB- is comprehending what is right or wrong . And that is not restricted to his addiction but all judgments in his life . Whether or not to cheat on someone 's wife , or whether or not to trust someone , whether or not in his actions\/inactions he is unintentionally causing anyone harm . Which is why we see he is made to believe his wife 's death , his brother 's suicide is his doing . But this is what his subconscious is telling him . This is what the cure is trying to tell him . The treatment that the Guruji is giving him is completely psychological . We find all the patients\/relatives of the people who have been to see the `` Prayogshala '' is admitted to a ward which is made by the Prayogshala itself . People will misinterpret as an emotional blackmail , but in truth its cleansing the soul . We see that the antagonist feels claustrophobic at the end of the end of his dream . He says that his throat is parched and he needs a smoke , when he breaks a window and rushes to the middle of nowhere to get a smoke . The dream of Siberia , the Russian soldier shooting him -LRB- although no blood comes out -RRB- is all an indication that this is not real , its the journey of the soul , a pathway to cure of his afflictions . We find many clues to this right from the start to the end , to the point when he is desperately trying to prove to the cops that he did n't murder his wife , we find him going all ends out to prove that he is innocent , but somehow nothing works out , since HE has been living a dream , and he just woke up , so his stories are not matching up . This is something novel that Fincher did in the legendary `` Fight Club '' We find in the end the real K , looking out as if searching for a long lost friend , but in real he was searching for his soul , which was waiting to be cleansed , and as his soul his bathed in fire , it is cleansed and is returned to him . About the missing fingers , well everyone thought that was another torture device , but did anyone notice the fingers missing ?? They were the index finger and the middle finger , the ones we use to smoke . They are taken from the patient as a precaution . And the journey of the soul is complete only when he convinces another of his kin to undergo the same procedure , then his finger is returned to him . The movie was like I said , superb , and instead of praising any of the actors , well , this is a all in all Kashyap movie throughout . It did n't matter who was the actor , true John Abraham has done a remarkable job , but the genius that Kashyap is , made this movie so good . The direction and screenplay made this the success that it is . The script was just too good , and the sets used , -LRB- which I think were real locations actually -RRB- were also marvelous . Also the small glimpses of cheap visual effects makes it even more brilliant to show the journey of the soul . The soundtrack is also too good . Apart from the Hindi numbers exclusively for the movie , we are also treated with lots of melodious oldies starting from Frank and Nancy Sinatra to others , and to careful notice one can see that all these songs were about smoking . Paresh Rawal is also excellent in his role as the Guruji , he makes it look so easy . Ayesha Takia is again just a pretty face in this movie , without not much chance to prove herself . Lastly this review would be incomplete without a special credit to the masterful , artful Anurag Kashyap . He made a movie about a social peril , about smoking , and he made it look so easy , that it was just brilliant . He has well proved his merit over all other contemporaries . It is just pathetic that people still want to watch stupid remakes by Sanjay Leela Bhansali , irritating soap\/family dramas by Karan Johar , and utter bullshit from the likes of Farah Khan , Sajid Khan when they always have options of watching brilliant stuff from this man . This perhaps is my longest review but you also do n't get to see such exquisite movies such as No Smoking everyday . 9\/10 !!! " ,9
" No smoking is a maze . Anurag Kashyap is the wannabe maverick genius of Bollywood . -LRB- I say wannabe because the official maverick genius is Ram Gopal Varma :--RRB- . His films either do not finish , or do not get released or release years later . After the solid ` Black Friday ' , it was difficult to ignore his next release and so I went to watch ` No Smoking ' . No Smoking is a puzzle . It is a maze through the uncharted territories in Hindi cinema . Kashyap has donned a David Lynch hat this time . He unpacks a bag of questions on the screen for you which you have to find answers for yourself . And that , he backs up with excellent technical support from all other departments , so that you are not distracted in your search for answers . I 'll be honest . I did not really understand the film but I guess that is the way Kashyap wants it to be . He wants me to unravel the layers of the film as and when I have time . In that process , when I 'd have soaked myself thoroughly in ` No Smoking ' , I 'll let it go , not caring to be bothered by it anymore . Just like K -LRB- John Abraham 's character -RRB- does to his cigarette . a -RRB- Is cigarette a metaphor for all the things we lust for which only destroy us at the end ? -LRB- I 'm reminded of the line from ` Pulp Fiction ' where Bruce Willis ' girl friend tells him how things that are good to touch are not good to look at , referring to a pot belly -RRB- b -RRB- Is Paresh Rawal 's character actually God ? Is he the villain because he does not let us pursue our lust and plays by his rules - rules which can not be bent or broken ? c -RRB- In the end , does someone always have to really loose his soul and conscience ? Can this world no go round if everyone owns his soul till the end ? I do n't know if these are the questions that No Smoking asks . But it did force me to think of these . The film is a technical accomplishment . The camera work , the set designs and graphics are all top notch . Tin cans were stacked up to create amazing visuals -LRB- you do n't always need Switzerland :--RRB- . Music is in tune with the film and Gulzar , as always , has written lyrics that are sign-posts in this maze . Kudos also to Kumar Mangat and Vishal Bharadwaj for having the guts to produce such a film . John Abraham is good . He always manages to do well in caught-on-all-sides characters . Paresh Rawal shines in his role . It was a relief to see him at some place other than a mindless Priyadarshan muddle . No Smoking , no doubt , is at par technically with the best in the world but sadly enough , it has very little conventional entertainment value . It may be one of the milestones that Kashyap had to cross in his path to higher glories . " ,7
" Crazily Abstract . . Unbelievably Brilliant . It is one of the few movies that is a mix of intended stupidity , sarcasm and at the same time a great use of the plot . The movie starts off with things that you can readily digest to be possible , but things become hazy and unreal as the movie proceeds , making you feel that Kashyap has slipped somewhere . But the process of the story reveals that nothing in the movie is real or unreal , for a question of possibility to arise , and you are left with a lot of questions with many possible answers , none seeming right or wrong . The most common aspect of any abstract movie is the fact that at some point before the end the director tells you what the whole movie was about . The whole abstractness is broken or justified in the end . But ` No Smoking ' takes that a few dimension higher . Every now and then it gives you a feeling that you have been able to look through the director and break into the story . And every time it leaves you more devastated . To make things better , or worse i do n't know , the end gives you a feeling that you have finally cracked the mystery and you feel proud of yourself , and reach cloud nine . But Kashyap takes no time to push you back to earth , and you fall so hard that it leaves you with no option but to appreciate the sheer brilliance of the director . Overall its a delight for someone who looks for more that a story or a perfect ending in a movie . " ,10
" Itzz different . I watched this movie once and could n't resist myself from watching it again only 10 mins later . A black metaphor of life , which poses some serious questions to the thinking mind . Lust , and how far can you go to pursue your lust ? What if some supernatural entity is destined to stop you from committing the lust ? And what if the darker side of nature forces you to commit it ? Questions answered and many others unanswered . . this is a movie brilliantly crafted ; though at times the pace is slackened . And who says its a copy of the Game ? The questions this movie asks and forces us to think is totally different from the game . The treatment of this movie is very different , but i am afraid this difference will become too much for the general audience to grasp or to digest . Kudos to you Anurag Kashyap , for giving hungry people like me -LRB- those who have hunger for watching movies which are a class apart -RRB- a classic movie to feast upon , on the risk of losing most of your other customers . " ,8
" Vivid . Unreal . Stunning . Abstract art at its best . . Hmmm so did n't we think `` abstract art '' is a term coined to be used only for paintings or photographs or at best sculptures or any form of art that is static ? Whenever we thought of an abstract cinema , most of us would start and stop at Shyam Benegal . But Anurag Kashyap with his latest film , changes lots of definitions and perceptions . No doubt Shayam Benegal brand of cinema is one of the USPs of Indian film Industry . But usually in that brand of cinema you could see through Director 's brain by the end . You could make out what was the film maker trying to portray . But Anurag Kashyap keeps his card close to his chest till the end . It 's hard to define if it was a good thing to do or bad . But the fact remains that there would be numerous questions in your mind after watching this film with various possible answers and none of the answer being totally right or totally wrong . This is peak of vivid imagination . This is stuff dreams are made of . Anurag , the director of highly rated Black Friday , shows that there is an intelligent film maker in there who dares to think away from ordinary . This bold attempt may not fetch him commercial success every time , but one thing is for sure that we have a film maker who makes film he believes in and not for making money . This is a good sign for Indian cinema . He gives a new dimension to Art Cinema . Every few reels , you can feel proud that you have got to the crux of the events going on screen , you can soar sky high . But then suddenly you realize that you do n't have wing , the film takes an unimaginative new turn and you are left where you started . With stunning cinematography , amazing art work , superb direction and high class acting , this certainly is an experience of its own kind . John Abraham looks sexy with his hot 6 packs . Paresh Rawal is as good as it gets . Ayesha Takia is decent . Do n't try to find or infuse any sense or logic of your own , just watch what is shown , be it lady singing in Adnan Sami 's voice or a bath tub in Siberia opening in underground world in Mumbai , and you might like the ride .

" Very dark , but subtle ... . You read thru the comments here , either its in 8-9-10 range or its in 1-2-3 range . Its funny to see the movie invokes such drastic reactions in different people . That itself talks a lot about the cinematic power of this masterclass movie of `` A '' , -LRB- Anurag Kashyap -RRB- . To some extent , its a director 's indulgence . He did n't make the movie for you or me , he made it for himself . It 's a movie made for film school . The movie can be a textbook for various film-making subjects . Technically brilliant ! A very dark movie indeed , probably first movie of the film-noir kind to be made from Bollywood stable . Anurag Kashyap is a sort of rebel in the industry . I am glad he was able to express himself cinematically through this movie . Honestly , its really hard to understand the movie . And I did n't quite follow it either . But somehow , I really enjoyed watching it . Vishal Bharadwaj produced it - who else but another master of dark movies will understand this movie . Vishaal 's music is infectious in the movie . He surprises me with his never-ending creativity . Musically I associated him with Omkara , Maachis type music , mellow , neo-classical , haunting . But his experimentation with Jazz in this movie is truly outstanding . Apart from the songs , the movie SHOULD get recognition for its background score . Deep rooted in jazz , I had to rewind the movie several times to listen to some background jazz scores . What else Vishaal has in store for us ??? Its interesting to get a piece of director A 's mind through his blog , where he really expresses himself , go to passionforcinema.com to read his blog . If you are anywhere close to film-making , you will love reading his writings . Anurag Kashyap is a different class of movie director . I am not sure if he can make much money trying to follow his passion , because it is very hard to get accepted with this kinda movies . However , I wish he make a few semi-commercial movies to give him the money to experiment with true gems like No Smoking . Last thing I want him to be branded as a crazy lunatic of the bollywood . Bravo Mr Kashyap !! " ,8
" Simply amazing . ` No Smoking ' is a masterpiece . It embodies so many ideas , every scene , every frame giving you a clue about the whole , leaving messages in pieces that for a normal ` entertainment ' seeking audience , it becomes a challenge . The director challenges the audience to give up their passive viewing and think , decipher what goes on with the protagonist K. The movie is full of metaphors and clues , the people here represent ideas\/ideals . For example , smoking and K 's addiction to smoking is equivalent to freedom and a person 's passion to work with freedom . The rehab center , Baba Bengali and K 's friends who send him to quit smoking are the ` system ' . Everyone complies and obeys the system without asking themselves what ` they ' the individual wants . The system makes sure that everyone complies fully without even a hint of opposition ... -LRB- symbolically represented by ` cutting fingers ' and torturing family members ... if u fail to quit smoking -RRB- . Inspite of everything , if you dare to ` desire ' , your spirit is cleansed . That is evident in the last ten minutes , when K 's real self , is across the glass wall crying as he sees himself without the soul , without the freedom to desire ... just a spineless body that has submitted to the system . There are many other clues and interpretations , but I think these are the more obvious ones . Wrote specifically for the people who complained they failed to make a ` head ' or ` tail ' out of the film . The director , Anurag Kashyap believes that the Indian audience is ` spoon-fed ' and looking at reviews and people 's reaction to ` No-Smoking ' , its no wonder that everyone wants to stay away from it . They would rather remain ` spoon-fed ' than grow up . An amazing piece of art . . the first of its kind to be ever made in India . " ,10
" wan na THINK deep , just watch it than ! . EXCELLENT is the only word that suits on this movie , i just saw this movie in December 2010 because of the great Indian reviewers who had given such a bad comments on this movie , my friend told me again and again to watch this movie but i was always saying no to him -LRB- i thought why to watch that movie which is rated 1.5 \/ 5 in the times of India -RRB- ... i was wrong with every aspect , it is a shame that i had watch this great movie so late ! i loved every scene of this movie , this movie has really something to say in each and every scene , Anurag Kashyap no doubt is the best director in India who wanted to change the taste of Indian viewers and i know that he will succeed in this ... storyline great , cinematography great , a big hand for Jhon and Paresh , they did the great job ... a deep , dark and real concept makes confused sometimes but if you start thinking deeper you 'll see that this masterpiece really has many things to say ... very well done Anurag , very well done the other star cast ... lastly i wanted to say that please watch this different masterpiece and you 'll be surely comparing it to the Hollywood movies !

" Lynchish puzzle on Bollywood screen . For Bollywood movie-goers who have n't seen NO SMOKING , this is my recommendation This is weird movie . Watch it at your own risk . For those who expect an anti-smoking movie about how to give up smoking ... PLEASE DO N'T WATCH IT . But if you like any or all of the following movies , DO watch this movie : LostHighway , FWWM , BartonFink , Kafka , Jacob 's Ladder . Movies like Matrix , Spider , Memento , Fight Club , Adaptation-dole out the solution to the puzzle in real time-on the screen which the average viewer can follow . And then ... there are movies like NO SMOKING , LOST HIGHWAY , MULHOLLAND DR. , FWWM , INLAND EMPIRE . . which do not give you all the answers . You 'll have to figure out the movie in your head after the last frame has played . Instead of showing Langdon follow the clues to crack the code ... you will be given the clues to be your own Langdon . Loosely based on King 's Quitter 's Inc. , NO SMOKING is a story of a man 's struggle against his addiction and ego . \*\*\* Spoilers Ahead \*\*\* This is what you see on the screen ... K is an arrogant , self-obsessed , businessman . He chain-smokes probably because of a disturbed childhood ... some crap between parents , who keep getting married and divorced . His wife Anjali threatens to leave unless he quits smoking . He is recommended to this rehab program in the slums of Dharavi at a `` Prayogshala '' , where Shri Shri Prakash Guru Ghantal Baba Bangali threatens severe bodily harm to him and his family for every cigarette that he smokes . K 's arrogance lets all hell loose on him . The BABA 's spies are everywhere ... -LRB- Ram , Shyam , Balram -RRB- and K can not smoke a cigarette without the BABA coming to know about it . K keeps waking up from bizarre nightmares , which have consequences in the real world . K loses his hearing , brother dies in a weird accident\/suicide , K loses his fingers -LRB- awesome :P -RRB- , wife is killed K ends up in the `` Prayogshala '' where he can not take a bath until he pays the 1 re that he owes the BABA . In the last scene , we see K recommending this program to his other mate in order get his fingers back . And here is my take on the film ... K - the arrogant , addicted guy with the not-so-stable childhood and a marriage soon-to-turn into a divorce goes to the `` Prayogshala '' and that is where the reality ends and nightmares \/ hallucinations begin . The `` Prayogshala '' brainwashes K to-the-extreme , leading him into believing whatever we see on screen . Here is what Anurag had to say about his movie post the release '' . . it is a film about arrogance . . of two kinds . . why I made it , the way I made it , the reasons I have never discussed it before . . it is my most personal movie . . I am K. . K 's arrogance is the obvious arrogance , that everyone sees everyday . . he smokes . . he breathes nicotine . . He says NOBODY tells me what to do . . I breathe cinema . . and forever everyone has been telling me not to make the kind of cinema I do . . NO SMOKING is a tale of an arrogant man and another who is much more arrogant , who lives in his world , where he controls everything and he thinks he is morally superior to any existing humans , he is the kind of man who thrives on minorities and underprivileged , he worships the dictatorial attitude and all he wants from you is to lose your soul and convert . it , s a tale about an arrogant man 's descent into morality . . and the architecture of the moral world is so absurd that it sometimes beats reality . . '' `` GIVE ME THE LIBERTY TO KNOW , TO UTTER , TO ARGUE FREELY ACCORDING TO MY CONSCIENCE ABOVE ALL LIBERTIES ... Since , I do not have the liberty , and I get banned every time I am directly stating my opinions , one has to wage a guerrilla war . . no smoking is my guerrilla war . . and in the end the man loses to the system and the only way he can survive is after having lost his soul -LRB- freedom -RRB- . . everyone expects a good versus evil film , where good wins over evil , where the end sums it up , and all is well at the end . . well it does n't happen here . . here K does n't want to , but never comes to know how and when he gave in to the system , but accepts it and starts to do what his own people did to him . . why ? in order to survive . . why his treatment becomes an incomprehensible nightmare , because it does in real life , I am the living proof . This film is just the treatment the powerful -LRB- Baba Bangali -RRB- puts K -LRB- the man whose allusions are of greatness , seemingly invincible -RRB- through to bring him over to his side and manages . . there is nothing more . . '' Here are things I like about the movie ... Great cinematography , the loose inspirations - Quitters Inc. , the dwarf -LRB- remember Lynch 's FWWM -RRB- , the symbolisms ... and of course , this is an important piece of cinema ... the first of its kind in Bollywood history . Here is where I expected more from the movie ... Lynch movies like Lost Highway , Mulholland Dr. , or INLAND EMPIRE have a lot of shock value , beauty and bizarreness besides the puzzle that is put forward for us . All these elements enhance the entertainment value of the movie and viewers end up loving the movie despite failing to solve the puzzle . Anurag failed in doing this . The script could have used more work ... e.g. including elements that would make more meaning on repeated viewings ... remember Matrix ... Lastly , the background score could have used a lot more work to give the movie a different mood . To sum it up ... Lovers of Gen-X surreal cinema should definitely watch this movie despite its flaws . Must notice Trivia ... BTW ... did you notice the transparent imp ... that was always around in BABA 's basement ... ALSO . . did u notice Anurag in the elevator with John ... The B\/W scenes with laughter track were heavily inspired by Oliver Stone 's NBK ... " ,8
" a tribute to abstract cinema . after the devastating black Friday , director Anurag Kashyap is back with yet another film , this time roughly based on a Stephen king novel quitters inc. no smoking is a film which is not meant for everyone , in fact the number of people who will find this movie engaging is very few and far between . the central character of the film `` K '' is addicted to smoking which becomes the worrying point for his wife Anjali who threatens him that she would think of divorce if he does n't think of leaving smoking . helpless he decides to go into a rehabilitation center , who 's process of making smokers quit is a bit unconventional to say the least . what happens after that should not be revealed . the movie has some brilliant visual effects , excellent cinematography and strong direction for most of the part . john Abraham pulls of a difficult role pretty well though he has a long way to go before he can boast of his acting skills . there are flaws in the film and for which it would fail to get an audience in most places , the director of the film takes it 's audience for granted , he is so busy in showing off his genius that he forgets about the people for whom he is making this movie . the result is the bizarre puzzling ending . in all this film is one that avoids traditional Bollywood clich s and is fresh in its story , look and treatment . Just on final word of advise for the director , at the time when Indian new wave cinema is again starting to grow , lets all just not make different movies but lets all make good movies . " ,7
" a brave film from a brave filmmaker . This is one of those films which people will either love or hate . There is no middle ground , quite like the film . Abstract , confusing , crazy , spiritual , supernatural ... some of the few words that were doing rounds in my head when i was watching the movie . ANd there is no way i can even describe the story without revealing plot points ... which are not interesting by their own . . but the way they were picturised , speaks volumes about the director 's creativity . 1 . DO NOT watch the movie if u are lazy to think and try to analyze a movie . . even while it is running . The director most definitely did not intend it for u. 2 . DO Watch it definitely if you like movies which make you think ... real hard . Starting with the film , It starts off with a dream sequence -LRB- in siberia or some place like that -RRB- where the main protagonist is shot dead for wanting to smoke . That sets the tone of the film . And then starts the real film . A series of inexplicable and seemingly irrational events occur frequently throuhgout the film . Mr. K -LRB- which does n't stand for anything -RRB- is left by his wife who is tired of his never ending habit . A couple of his friends -LRB- intrestingly both of them sport hearing aids in both ears -RRB- , who were his smoke-buddies , convince him to enroll in a rehabilitation program conducted by a certain organization `` Prayogshala '' . He goes through a very mysterious but ordinary scrap-paper warehouse to reach PRayogshala and enroll . Thus begin his woes . there he encounters SRI SRI Baba Guru Ghantal ... who delivers a lecture on the ill effects of cigarettes , alcohol and other drugs , in the most enchanting fashion . NOTE : It would definitely help you to take a note of every dialogue that the BABA delivers . . as it forms the crux of the plot . An Unconvinced Mr.K refuses to enroll and tries to get out . . but the mysterious place he enters has no exit . He is made to sign a contract against his will and also pay a fees of 21,11,110 Rs . -LRB- in cheque -RRB- and a token of Re .1 in cash -LRB- which he does n't have on him -RRB- . Uptil now , i 've mentioned more than a couple of strange things . THis is just the beginning . And i 'd better stop at this . What i felt was most interesting about this film is the fact that he gets the message across so strongly without having to resort to any preachy melodrama.There is a strong dose of spirtuality involved . Talk about the soul , body relationship . . and the effect that cigarettes have on you . Anurag Kashyap -LRB- Mr. Director -RRB- definitely had an option to keep the plot simple . . but chose not to do so . Instead he teases the audience and tests their patience with the most unnatural twists and turns throuhgout the movie . He also uses a lot of unconventional narrative techniques like occasional subtitles and cartoonish speech boxes -LRB- the cloudy ones -RRB- frequently in the first half . Also used is a flashback scene with a television Sit-COM -LRB- for laymen : where u can hear the audiences laughter -RRB- style picturization rather effectively . The last time i 've seen this used , was in Oliver Stone 's `` Natural Born KIllers . '' These narrative styles only add to the confusion . And the director does n't make it any easier in the second half . But slowly things start making sense and the audience 's inevitable wait for a climax which would explain everything comes to an ------ end . The story has an extraordinary supernatural undertone to it.And , at the end it would feel like , it was a message from above . `` if u smoke cigarette , u would not only screw up your life , also every one around u '' . -LRB- I 've deliberately tried to model my review in the film 's style ... seems to tell something but it does n't . -RRB- Now the best part about this movie in my opinion is its music . Vishal Bharadwaj is a composer par excellence . THe music just adds to the overall spookiness . The picturisation was brilliant . There is a dark-look to this movie . . and quite appropriately so . THe locations and sets were a perfect fit . Acting : John fits this role to the hilt . His arrogance and `` nobody tells me what to do '' attitude is evident throughout the film '' even when he is not saying anything . Paresh Rawal is one of the most consistent performers in Bollywood and here he shows the reason . His portrayal of the mysterious BABA GURU GHANTAL is outstanding . When he speaks , he makes u want to listen to him even though nothing makes sense . Overall , i feel it was a difficult movie to make . Not necessarily the production , but the whole concept being amazingly original and equally absurd , it was a risk to leave a movie like this to the audiences ' intelligence . And i applaud Anurag for his effort . Granted , he throws the audiences off track very early in the movie and does n't do much to bring them back . But , If u stay patient with the movie . . u 'll be amazed . " ,10
" The best tribute to Franz Kafka . For all those illiterates -LRB- the numbers of these great unwashed I do not doubt , it is hardly surprising that the movie bombed -RRB- who give it 1-2 stars and talk about preserving sanity , a question : Ever heard of Franz Kafka ? I saw this movie just after I had read The Trial and The Castle back-to-back . It is a brilliant tribute to the genius of Kafka : I wonder that is what Anurag Kashyap intended in the first place . The plot follows the same twists and turns that one would have in a Kafka novel , particularly the descent to meet the Baba . It is not just any shady place , it is a passage from The Trial faithfully replicated : when K first approaches his accusers -LRB- note the name : another Kafka hallmark -RRB- . Sheer genius . Both the original writer , and the film-maker . " ,10
" Brilliant , daring , unconventional ... . `` No Smoking '' is the most brilliant , daring , unconventional film ever to come out of Bollywood . It could have been written by Franz Kafka or begotten by Stephen King upon John Grisham . John Abraham is outstanding as the arrogant selfish Indian yuppie `` K '' , a Kafka hero if there ever was one . When his bullied wife leaves him , he 's referred by a peculiar friend and his own peculiar family doctor to a mysterious clinic that guarantees he can kick his most nasty habit , smoking . The clinic turns out to be a nightmarish set-up -LRB- The Firm -RRB- from which there is no back-sliding without dire consequences . `` K '' , the master of all he surveys immediately rebels and brings down hellish results upon himself and his family . The viewer is jolted along on this queasy and horrific experience just as is `` K '' . Will `` K '' ultimately kick his `` habit '' and eradicate much of his personality along with it ... will `` K '' become a model `` Stepford '' husband ? Watch this disturbingly entertaining allegorical fable and find out ! " ,8
" the best Hindi movie ever . for the past one year i have been avoiding Hindi movies . . mainly for the reason that these movies have failed to strike a chord neither with my heart nor with my brain ... but this movie brings my faith right back into Hindi ... i have read many negative reviews about this movie , but i somehow felt that the movie must have something in it to provoke such a reaction , so i finally saw it to find out ... yes this is one of the movies in which you will think u have solved the puzzle and the next moment u will be disappointed that this is not the correct solution , and you will be made to think again ... and yes this movie has many possible interpretations , this is the most brilliant thing about this movie ... this is a David lynch kind of a movie , but it somehow seems to have really struck a chord even more than lynch movies ... the acting was absolutely perfect , they did not overact , they did not underact!Paresh Rawal 's character was very strong ... man this person can act , you will listen to him , even if you do n't understand a single word of what he is speaking ! then there ... another gem of a performance , and john Abraham ... no one could have done the role better except may be Christian bale or tom cruise . . he has that suave look and narcissist approach which was needed for the role ! the ambiance created by the director . . the BM music , the brilliant camera angles , the creation of those really dark and mysterious situations and places , the plot -LRB- or the lack of it , which was absolutely perfect , the presence of a solid plot would have spoiled the experience -RRB- , the screenplay -LRB- brilliantly done , specially the dreams -RRB- ... the premise of the movie is ` smoking ' . . the protagonist K , is a chain smoker and his wife leaves him for that , then provoked by two of his friends he joins a organization to leave his smoking ... but then his suffering starts . . now i wont move any further ... because i will be spilling spoilers !! it provokes a deep anti-smoking sentiment in the viewer ... if this movie had been promoted properly it would have made it to the IMDb 250 ...

" Unthinkable , shocking but brilliant . After watching this movie first thing came in my mind was ` Dante 's Inferno ' . Movie is like a pre-renaissance theological epic.Movie proceeds with metaphor to metaphor . At Some points these metaphors are logical and touching but some times Its just perception so hard to get . as far I understood Movie is about Indian philosophy of soul and Nirvana which also includes hell and heaven concept . Cigarette is metaphor for Lust or ` Kaam ' which lie between incertitude of Moral and Immoral . Baba bangali is God or angel who want to purify soul from lust to help him achieve nirvana but also give him hell if fails to do so . John is protagonist who has different set of morals fabricated with ego . Like all God baba bangali is has very nature of God : totalitarian , part kind , part terrible etc. . And understanding of morality and immorality of God is just polarization of perception -LRB- like always -RRB- . For Baba all those thing which majority think Good\/Bad is Good\/Bad . stubborn behavior of John provoke Baba 's wrath on him ... Rest is just viewer 's perception what he want to see in this movie " ,9
" Excellent movie . . a must must watch . Here 's a warning : If u are not interested in analyzing a movie , this movie is not for you at all . I literally saw this movie 10 times and the count will keep on increasing . An excellent cinema , great work done by Anurag K ashyap . This movie really takes you on a roller coaster ride and in the end leaves you so much to think about . The title of the film is No Smoking and the director had every option to make it simple and straight but the director dared to take a road less traveled by and the outcome is a class apart , and you do n't generally come across such awesomeness . This movie revolves around K -LRB- played by John Abraham -RRB- who is a chain smoker and a self made , arrogant person clearly evident with his one liner is nobody tells me what to do . His wife Anjali , sick and tired of his smoking habits , decides to call off their marriage and leaves the home . She agrees to come back only on one condition that K have to go to rehab center run by SHRI SHRI BABA Bangali . K decides to pay a visit and that 's where the whole extra ordinary experience of the movie starts . This movie will take you through a journey at the end of which you have to interpret the entire scenario and this will give u a proud feeling . Again giving credit to director and actors -LRB- John , Paresh Rawal Ranveer shorey has done a commendable job -RRB- , i must say this bollywood movie is epic and has achieved cult status . A MUST WATCH !! " ,10
" Amazing flick ! . Vigorously recommended ! This movie placed a milestone on the path of Indian cinema , which , unfortunately , will remain untrodden for a long time . AK 's back . The dark situations , the dark comedies , plot to keep you on the seat 's edge , excellent screenplay , mysterious portrayal of characters . But this movie is n't for normal movie buffs . This is special . John Abraham has done probably the best acting of his career . Ayesha Takia is cute , a bit unused here . Paresh Rawal is the Guru Gantaal to look for ! Amazing ! His characterization is too difficult to visualize . But then , it is Anurag Kashyap and Raj Singh Chaudhary , who have done it ! Kudos . The film just failed to amaze audience , but then is it really so ? Of course not . This flick will turn your mind upside down . Awesome . The film is stylish too , unlike AK 's other low budget films . Super recommendation for this ! " ,9
" Creativity at its Best . The movie is a masterpiece with lot of vision involved breaking the shackles of traditional Indian movie experience . It is worth a watch because of the vivid imagination of the director as the movie truly depicts the geniuses with its artistry creativity . The performance of every1 in the movie was awesome -LRB- special mention of paresh rawal -RRB- kudos to anurag kashyap for making such a cult movie.It should make a new benchmark for original scripts to be written which give the movie goer a new experience all together . I do hope the new breed of directors make more films unique movies like dis one which takes our quality of our cinema to a new level " ,8
" Indian Films are getting there . I just saw the movie after an year of its release . I can now understand why it was a flop or only seen by a few film aficionados in India . Indian audience is not ready for such path breaking , abstract and surreal cinematic experience . Maybe that 's the reason why our filmmakers are also readily catering to the lowest common denominator . There is rarely any director or producer who is ready to invest his time and money to create art rather than potboilers . Slowly and steadily , all this is changing . Directors like Anurag Kashyap , Amir Khan , Dibakar Bannerjee , Rakesh Omprakash Mehra , Sriram Raghavan , Vishal Bharadwaj etc. who are doing things differently . If more directors transcend the mercenary concerns and come up with the films like these then I am sure the audience will also evolve and seek out better movies than the regular song and dance , money crunchers like Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi . No Smoking is the clean entertainment for the intellect . There is no skin show , no dance numbers , no clich d dialogues what it has is a focused story , thematic songs -LRB- some selling out to commercial cinema , but all songs are apt and add to the story , great acting by all especially , John Abraham and Paresh Rawal . The movie is very Indian in its look but very International in its feel . One is reminded of Lynch 's Lost Highway and Blue Velvet other movies like Fight Club , etc. . While watching it . Great Movie Universally Recommended " ,10
" Please watch it !!! . The reason i 'm saying this is , that many people discard this film as another disappointment after reading all the reviews and the box-office collections . I 'm not saying it is a path breaking movie or any of that stuff , but it is surely worth a watch . Watch it just because of its incredible plot . Kudos to Anurag Kashyap for making this film . No doubt the execution could have been much better , but still it is surely an engrossing watch . You might not understand every minute details in the first watch but will surely get an idea of the story . Indeed it is a disappointment after Black Friday in terms of film-making , but is far ahead in terms of the plot and idea . Again a request : Please go watch No Smoking , it is much better than many recent movies you have watched . " ,7
" All the makings of A Bollywood Cult Movie ! . Relax folks , this review contains no spoilers at all . I wo n't spoil this great movie watching experience for you . Well friends I may sound biased in my review of this movie , but believe me I have no choice . I want to clear the air by saying that this movie is solely for viewers who like their cinema stylish and crisp and who do n't want to be spoon fed , and more importantly are prepared to be patient . So there you go , automatically this eliminates more than 80 % of the Indian audience . For the rest of us , it 's truly an abstract delight . The acting is good . You get the feeling that this role was made for John Abraham aka ` K ' . Paresh Rawal , as always , gives a strong performance as the ` Baba ' . The soundtrack is awesome and special mention must be given for the song ` Kash Laga ' which is top notch in the setting of the movie . The cinematography and direction are superb . Mr. Kashyap takes us on a wonderful , yet a frightening journey . I wo n't give you the story of the movie , because there is no point , in it really . What I would tell you , is that the film is full of symbolisms and nuances , and may appear to be a bit confusing for the average viewer . But there in also lies its beauty . This work may even be compared to the works of the great David Lynch . Though the movie was n't so multi-layered and complicated as his works generally are , it certainly dwelled on those lines . I think that 10 years from now , this would be seen as a benchmark in Indian cinema . And it has the makings of a cult movie alright . " ,10
" Mind - Boggling . cheers for anurag kashyap for starting being bold enough to make such a daring and demanding movie . It demands a very refined intellect and certain amount of originality in the viewer to appreciate or even understand this movie.If you think you are a movie aficionado go and watch this movie and do n't gripe about its being archaic.Now for those who did n't understand the movie ... it develops on two simultaneous planes one the real or physical plane and another a spiritual or subconscious plane -LRB- reason for many dream like and seemingly illogical sequences -RRB- . Paresh Rawal is not actually a charlatan . He is a mesmerizer or some kind of a psyche-reprogramming expert to whom the hero goes to quit smoking.The ensuing chaos is all about the psychologist trying to make him feel guilty about smoking by making his subconscious believe that his beloved ones are dying one by one because of his smoking . The cryptic settings akin to Nazi concentration camps is because his wife was watching a concentration camp movie that morning when it started.All that seems to be illogical is happening in the dreamworld.The song in which he seems to forget that his secretary and his wife are one and the same woman are straight from a dream.The police officer smoking a cigar is a dream sequence because he is coming straight from a cigar launch function -LRB- the Fidel castrated cigar -RRB- . The director has given many subtle hints as to which one is a real life scene and which one is a dream scene.You just have to watch out for the really straight from the dream things in the movie.And the last sequence -LRB- gas chamber -RRB- is again borne out of the concentration camp association in his mind of the whole thing.Gassing of soul means the total reprogramming of his subconscious so that he not only does not smoke now but has also lost his previous self assurance and his confidence .

" outstanding work by Anurag Kashyap . eagerly waiting for this movie finally its been released some how i manage to see it on first day.I think it was the best movie i watch in 2007 . The story is little bit complicated but its really gripping full of twists the background score and cinematography is awesome.Anurag Kashyap got the skill . I cant imagine that such kind movies will ever produced in India.Its an outstanding movie about which u keep thinking for many days.I fill really sad after reading reviews about film.another good movie going to be waste only because people do n't understand it.i people here do n't want and do n't like to watch anything creative and path breaking.u cant compare it with `` black Friday '' both the movies deal with different stream . must watch movie defiantly go for it . " ,10
" bravo ! . First of all , I regret that i did n't watch this movie in d cinema hall ... not that it would make any difference ... But , I would 've wanted to spend 150 bucks for this movie rather than crap movies like `` Om Shanti Om '' or any crap which comes out every Friday . Second , Bravo Mr. Kashyap ... its d audiences who do not deserve a film maker and films made by you . this is a brilliant piece of art . You have created something like a Indian fight club or Indian sin city ... Thirdly ... Goddamn all the audiences who did n't like the movie !!!! Why does something obscure happenings be impalpable to u turds ?? Why everything has to be spoon fed to u to understand what is being shown ? Why is this obscure to u and why is n't 50 people bursting into choreographed dance song sequences seem normal ? Finally , yes , arguably the best movie of the year ... " ,7
" What the fcuk ?? . Those were the first words that came out of my mouth after watching this film . I was very excited to see this movie , and even after not being able to understand everything , i still like it . I could not understand anything 2nd half onwards , and i watched it 2 more times and read various articles about it , but still could n't be sure if I totally understood the movie or not , if I got the director 's intentions right or not ? and even after boggling my mind to insanity , i still like it , i do n't know why ... But I also want to know that cinema is entertainment , not a quiz or a puzzle like this movie is ... my advice : watch it if you want to interpret it ... and have the time to , because this wo n't provide light entertainment " ,8
" Brilliantly shot and well told story . Finally watched No Smoking . Loved it . This is very much in the category of experimental cinema . Kashyap does n't rush through his scenes either . So you get a 2 hour film with the director projecting all the creativity he can on the screen . Two hours is pretty long for a creative movie not having much songs which is a good thing given how much Kashyap wanted to express in the film . The story was very abstract and people can make a lot of interpretations . Essentially , it is a case of altered realities . Was whatever happening in the movie real or only going on in K 's -LRB- John Abraham -RRB- imagination ? How much of it was real , if at all ? For instance , Takia mentions near the last scene that she was the secretary in K 's office as well as his wife because K wanted it that way . Even when Ranbir shows that he has all his 5 fingers around the middle of the film , was that because his fingers had magically come back or was it always there , just K imagining a couple being cut ? What was real and what was merely a figment of the imagination is n't very important here though , as points can be made for both sides just as was the case in Pan 's Labyrinth . The more important aspect from a cinematic experience is how the movie is captured and told so brilliantly by a director who holds a lot of promise to do some superb work in the future . He already has Black Friday , and now this in his body of work . Smokers , or any addict for that matter , in most cases believes that he knows his own limits and K thought he knew his own too - which is why , for instance , he was brave enough to go into that dark pit hole in the baba 's place . However , he was constantly stretched in the movie till he lost his soul itself . In that -LRB- and it is one of many interpretations which can be written -RRB- , it is definitely a moralistic movie where earlier , it seemed like going the Clockwork Orange way where the person with a problem would be forced to change his habit because of force and not free will essentially and exploring on the effects of forced changes - which No Smoking does n't do . No Smoking , as I said earlier , is about altered realities and consequences told very well . If it was left a wee bit more abstract and leaving the viewer pondering much more -LRB- the ending is pretty abstract mind -RRB- in the end , maybe it could have been even better but that does n't stop it from being an excellent film . " ,8
" No Conforming . No Smoking had gained a certain notoriety on the first day of its theatrical release because it was dissed as `` pathetic '' , `` too complex '' , `` self-indulgent '' etc. etc. by the most self-indulgent critics in India . Since critics rarely get it right and I love Anurag Kashyap 's work , I went to see the film . I came out thinking what 's wrong with critics in this country ? No Smoking is a haunting dark parody of conformism in society . If critics found this complex it makes you wonder if , these six-figure salary people have ever heard of Pasolini , Karel Kachyna or for that matter even David Lynch . . After all , these so called critics get highly paid to have a cinematic vocabulary . The story , is about a wealthy , egocentric character named K who is addicted to smoking . He will not quit because `` No one tells him what to do '' . He takes utter arrogant pride in his freedom to smoke ! It is his identity and he refuses to apologize for who he is . . a chain-smoker ! And he is not likable either . But when his wife threatens to leave him , it forces him to consider quitting . He decides to visit a rehabilitation center run by a religious priest -LRB- played brilliantly by Paresh Rawal -RRB- . The priest and his cult have a rather convincing way of making you quit . First , you have no choice . K is forced to enter the program at gun point and the method of rehabilitation is terrifying . For every cigarette you smoke , you will lose a loved one ! For the uninitiated critics of India , that is a metaphor for : a -RRB- Religion is the tyranny that forces a violent rehabilitation b -RRB- You can be forced to let go of your ego and conform to society -LRB- your wife , friends , family , norms of good behavior etc. -RRB- c -RRB- Belonging to a group is the only real choice available in a world of multiple choices . The film takes us into a journey of K 's soul and how it disintegrates from his body till the soul is finally destroyed by the fires of hell . Now , K is left soul-less , fearful , but a non-smoker with a content wife . What 's even more interesting is the allusion that K took up smoking , in the first place , due to peer pressure in his younger days . Hence , even his decision to smoke , which he so proudly identifies with his individualism , may have been influenced by group dynamics . I think its hilarious that Kashyap chose nicotine rehabilitation as a metaphor for society 's dictates . Now , for what 's wrong with the film . The casting is horrible . Except for Paresh Rawal , every actor disappoints . John Abraham is tolerable , though a real actor in the role of K , could have really turned this role into a brilliant performance . Ayesha Takia and the rest of the cast are beyond bad and at moments unwatchable . But the astonishing cinematography and set design compensate and allows one to bear the actors . At the end of the day , No Smoking is a horror story well told with some of the most haunting images of Indian Cinema . Yet it suffers due to poor acting . If you 'd like to see an attempt by a talented filmmaker to push the confining envelope of mostly pathetic Bollywood Cinema you must watch No Smoking . Kashyap does n't succeed all the way , but he does far better than what the critics are willing to admit . I 'd give it 6 out of 10 stars because of the horrible actors . " ,7
" Warning : This nauseating movie is far harmful than a cigarette ! . Anurag Kashyap s critically acclaimed Black Friday , raised my expectations from No Smoking , expecting it to be a decent drama carrying a strong message against smoking . But , all of the pointless nonsense hurled at you scene after scene in the name of creativity actually drives you beyond the threshold of tolerance . For the eternal length of this apology of a film , cutie Ayesha Takia was the only possible distraction . K , yes you read it right , it s a single alphabet name -LRB- John Abraham -RRB- is a successful , self-obsessed man who just can t seem to live life without lighting up a cigarette . Much to the chagrin of his wife who also doubles up as his secret secretary , Anjali -LRB- Takia -RRB- who tries to rid him off the habit , the obsession never seems to leave K. Enter , his friends who have quit the butt , introduce him to a certain Prayogshala with guaranteed results . Well , does our hero budge ? Not until his wife leaves him compelling K to visit the Prayogshala in run down metal shacks led by Shri Shri Prakash Guru Ghantal Baba Bangali Sealdah Wale -LRB- Paresh Rawal -RRB- who seems to wield magical influence on his subjects which sometimes borderline barbarism . Then , there is something called the Cigarette Shastra that the subject is supposed to read , and then sign a contract ! Baba s contract comes with no escape ! Offenders are magically tracked even if they were to escape to Africa or at times confined in Siberia ! Absurdities don t just end there . The Prayogshala has a place for harvested souls , a call center of burqua clad women , ways to chop fingers off offenders who touch cigarettes again . It s just another thing that they manage to reattach them too , when they get a new victim to sign up for the rehab . Probably , this movie in all its weirdness may make sense to self styled intellectuals , but for those looking for some semblance of sense , just Keep Out ! Maybe the movie had noble intentions to ward people from smoke . Well , for the headache you get after watching this , you may actually want to puff off a whole packet . The non-smoker too may want to try out the stuff , if not for anything but to disapprove the stuff the Baba does ! " ,1
" Lights up in the end . I 'm a big fan of John Abraham and I have seen almost all of his films and I liked most of them especially Dhoom , Zinda Karam is one of my most favorite films . He is a really good actor and never fails to impress . I did n't know that No Smoking was supposed to be an experimental film before I saw it because there has never been a Bollywood movie like that . I was surprised that there actually can be an Indian film like Donnie Darko . I really liked John Abraham 's character K who is a chain smoker ; self-obsessed arrogant and John played his character quite well . The film was normal up to when K -LRB- John -RRB- met Baba -LRB- Paresh -RRB- for the first time then after that it became strange and confusing e.g. wife secretary were the same , one rupee and the bathtub used as the connection to different locations . I liked the first half better because K was annoying his wife by smoking all the time and I do like topics that deal with problems of married couples . I did not have clue at all in the second half so I watched it again and every scene made better sense and my two best guesses are : 1 . That Baba is the devil -LRB- that 's why his lair is deep underground which is hell -RRB- and he captured K 's soul when he signed the contract and the film shows the entire journey of a soul . So it probably is a supernatural thriller . 2 . Baba said that `` If K smokes his first cigarette then his brother will die , second then his index middle fingers will be chopped off -LRB- because these fingers are used for smoking -RRB- , third then his wife will die , forth then his mother will die and fifth then they failed to cure him and they wo n't do anything . '' In the end K woke up and it was all a nightmare but when he raised his hand his two fingers were missing so it all happened but not exactly the way it was shown . So it probably is a simple story told in a character 's nightmare . It is heavily inspired by one of the three stories of a movie called Cat 's Eye . The story is called Quitters . Inc , which is written by Stephen King but it 's not exactly the same . I think the main reason why Anurag Kashyap made the film confusing is because so that the audience can feel the same situation that K is in because he is trapped in a world he does n't understand and that is a very hard thing to do so well done Anurag Kashyap . The best thing about the film is that it has excellent cinematography and background music . The best scene is the song Jab Bhi Cigarette . Music is smokin and the best songs are Jab Bhi Cigarette Phook De . The whole movie does hold your attention whether you like it or not . If it was a Hollywood film then it might of been on the top 250 . Overall No Smoking is a very different interesting film that lights up in the end . It was a disaster at box office and received many negative reviews from critics . Mainly they were saying that `` It is the worst movie of the year . '' although the worst has to either Partner . Jhoom Baraber Jhoom Cash . " ,10
" Say No to Smoking ... not to the film . . . Yesterday I got the chance to watch this film . Around one month back I saw the trailer of No Smoking and I found it very much appealing to go and watch it on the first day itself . I had some idea that the movie should be about quitting the habit , but its not exactly the same . The cinematography is superb and I rate Anurag 10\/10 for his direction . Story line is the weak point of the film . Anurag failed to make No smoking a commercial film , but it seems to be some kind of art film . It failed to spread the message that one should not smoke . I even heard people saying that `` I need to start smoking after watching this crap '' . What I suggest is that if you have patience to admire someone 's work , and can praise the plus points then you should watch it . The first half is really interesting and full of astonishing facts popping up.But the second half is slow and not everyone 's cup of tea . Everyone has acted really great and specially John Abraham with his sexy looks and Paresh Rawal have done full justice to their character . So If you are looking for something really different and can digest some strange cinema then No Smoking is the Flick what you should go for . The only thing I like to express is that `` Say No to Smoking ... not to the film . . '' cheers . " ,8
" do n't start smoking if you have not or have stopped . This movie has reiterated what is written on the pack of cigars . . But still people smoke . . to invite their problems and feel like they can get rid of worries by smoking . . Its weired ppl tend to smoke when the are burdened or just for being in different class . . Have seen ppl smoke so that they can spend time with those managers\/bosses while smoking and get their favor . . Even if the price of Cigar and bidi goes high ppl do n't think of quitting it . . but if prices of potato\/onion goes higher ppl tend to avoid eating it . . It is worst thing to know such behavior of literate human being . . When the humans will use their brain ?? Such movies may help some humans then this movie is really good in real life . . " ,8
" Disappointment . I expected a lot from Anurag Kashyap , as he was famous for being real and showing reality . But after watching the movie i did n't understand a single thing . What is the content of he movie . What message he wants to give ? I was completely lost . It was difficult to believe that the director of BLACK Friday made NO SMOKING . I saw 12 - 18 people leaving the movie halfway . The only good hing about the movie was Ranvir Shorey who did brilliant job . It was a joy to watch Paresh Rawal not making a fool of himself . But his performance lacked a punch that the character demanded . And as you may have gathered , I still have no clue what the movie was about . And quite frankly , I do n't want to know.You try so hard to understand what NO SMOKING tries to say , but the film is like one big puzzle that refuses to get solved . " ,1
" Statutory Warning : This Movie Might Drive You Insane ! . Do not , I repeat DO NOT watch this movie if you value your sanity . I sat through almost 3 hours of this movie and could not get a single clue about what the whole movie about . I spent a night analyzing the movie , racking my brain until I almost drove myself insane . The theater was almost empty on a Sunday night which was its third day of release . I think that more than accentuates the failure of the movie . The director did a very bad job of porting a Stephen King 's novel for Bollywood . At the end of the movie I was checking to see If I was the only one disappointed . People shaking their heads and joking about how bad the movie was reassured me . No one got the movie . And for the record I live in one of the posh areas of the city . If people like these are so clueless what happens to the masses ? " ,1
" Pull the chain instead . Despite being lifted from a Hollywood flick Derailed -LRB- which was n't exactly a huge hit -RRB- , The Train was far from entertaining and so predictable that you did n't even have to be of average intelligence to figure out who is bad who is good although I 've not seen Derailed . The film was supposed to be a thriller but was n't even a jot thrilling , then what is left ? The only good scene was the song Woh Ajnabee with its excellent cinematography . The Music is good and the song Woh Ajnabee is one of the best songs of 2007 but what is the use of good music in a bad film ? The story was so simple about Vishal Dixit -LRB- Emraan Hashmi -RRB- , a regular middle-class guy , is settled in Bangkok with his wife Anjali -LRB- Sayali Bhagat -RRB- and their five-year old daughter Nikki . Anjali Vishal are trying to gather together their deteriorating marriage . One day , on his way to work , Vishal meets Roma -LRB- Geeta Basra -RRB- , a beautiful woman and that is where his miserable life begins . Overall The Train chugged to a slow pace before it ran out of steam . Neither The Train nor its passengers -LRB- viewers -RRB- reached their destination . In fact , many of them wanted to pull the chain and jump out of the running train . " ,2
" The Train is derailed . Hasnain Hyderabadwala Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER -LRB- 2006 -RRB- remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which was n't that great in the first place The film looks similar to Emraan 's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however is n't as engrossing The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain 's characterization is n't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too Direction is okay Music is a winner , especially ZINDAGI NE , MAUSAM , WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual , Rajat Bedi fills the bill " ,2
" Another copy of Hollywood movie . This is OK movie to watch . Exactly copy of Hollywood movie `` Derailed '' . . for god sake these directors needs to stop doing plagiarism . Now about movie , nothing great about it or the performance of the character . The girl Geeta -LRB- Ms Kapoor -RRB- is hot and beautiful and thats only the reason make me keep watching this movie . If you guys have seen derailed then in initial part of the movie only you will realize that its another copy of movie . Anyway overall I 'll rate this movie 2\/10 as it has some pretty looking girl . Songs of the movie is OK too . . I would say its another concept they are trying to follow like they did with movie Murder . " ,2
" copy of derailed movie -LRB- derailed 1 -RRB- some lines should never be crossed . saw a sneak preview of this film yesterday in mumbai There are some `` cheesy '' moments but I 'm happy to say that they are far and few between . The acting is not academy-award winning but you will be pleased with the performances . It is an engaging film that brings you into a dark and gritty underworld that actually can feel quite real at times . You feel for the lead character . One of the strengths of this film is character development . It also has some twists that may actually surprise you in a good way . I think the real downfall of this film is that it has a `` Hollywood '' ending . For me the film loses points for this . One final note : the climax , although still good , was pieced together in such a way that it did not hold the tension enough for the theater audience . There was laughter and some heckling in my theater . I would n't walk into this film expecting a ground-breaking film that will change the genre forever , but it is does have some good pacing and the story moved al " ,1
" An absolute must see . . Fantastic ! A great documentary focusing on a long unsung faction of cult cinema known as Ozploitation . Tarantino features heavily as an expert of the genre . As an Australian , it 's scary watching how a foreigner could have so much knowledge and enthusiasm for films that have been almost purposely forgotten in their own homeland . Like any good documentary , it 's a real eye opening experience to get an insight into the lost world of blood , bikers and boobs . The directors , actors and those influenced -LRB- Greg McLean -LRB- Wolf Creek\/Rouge -RRB- , James Wan and Leigh Whannell -LRB- Saw -RRB- -RRB- share the stories of a fledgling film industry that embraced a Guerrilla style of film-making that stuck it to the stuffy cinema elite that wished they would disappear . An absolute must watch for anybody who thinks they 're an expert on cult\/trash cinema . " ,9
" One of the best documentaries I have seen in many years ! . It is about time a documentary was made about Australia 's 70 's and 80 's exploitation films , which range from sex comedies , car chase films , hardcore horror and kung fu flicks . Mark Hartley has created a fitting tribute which moves at an almost non-stop pace and is full of hilarious interviews , great clips and interesting tales of on-set accidents and rowdy actors . Unfortunately , I never got to experience this period of unknown Aussie film making which now -LRB- thanks to this documentary -RRB- may be uncovered again ! Not Quite Hollywood starts off with some background of the Aussie film industry back in the late 60 's \/ early 70 's and the strict censorship policies we had . This then moves into the first type of exploitation we had ; sex-fueled , gross-out comedies . Some notable ones are : Stork -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , Alvin Purple -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , The True Story of Eskimo Nell -LRB- 1975 -RRB- and Barry McKenzie Holds His Own -LRB- 1974 -RRB- . Most of these features copious amounts of nudity -LRB- both male and female -RRB- and sex -LRB- of which the doco shows quite a bit of -RRB- . These made a fair bit of money , but most of the critics despised the crassness and abrupt sexuality . Interviews with the lady stars -LRB- who are not afraid to talk about their mostly naked roles -RRB- and Barry Humphries are often funny . This first half an hour or so is a great introduction to the next section ... `` Comatose Killers and Outback Chillers . '' In this section , Hartley shows us Australia 's disturbed side with absurd , sadistic horror films which have a confessed fan , Quentin Tarantino . He excitedly reels off his favorites and how they have inspired some of his films -LRB- especially `` ill Bill : Vol . 1 . '' A few stand-out movies are : Patrick -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , Razorback -LRB- 1984 -RRB- , Snapshot -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , Harlequin -LRB- 1980 -RRB- and Long Weekend -LRB- 1978 -RRB- . Interviews with directors -LRB- Brian Trenchard-Smith and the late Richard Franklin -RRB- and the many actors are again incredibly intriguing and quite amusing . These films were popular in America , being released in the exploitation cinemas and garnering cult followings . The last section of the documentary is about `` High Octane Disasters and Kung Fu Masters . '' Tarantino really contributes to this part , showing a vast knowledge and passion for our car chase scenes and the `` fetishistic '' way they are filmed . Cult classics such as : Mad Max -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , The Man from Hong Kong -LRB- 1975 -RRB- , Roadgames -LRB- 1981 -RRB- and Turkey Shoot -LRB- 1982 -RRB- are all mentioned and discussed . This part becomes interesting , as directors talk about troubles with stunts -LRB- involving tragic deaths of cameramen and stuntmen -RRB- , injuries and actor problems . Tarantino lavishes praise on pretty much all these films and he is a pleasure to listen to . Also , new Aussie horror directors Greg McLean -LRB- `` Wolf Creek '' -RRB- and James Wan and Leigh Whannell -LRB- `` Saw '' -RRB- are interviewed and discuss the old and new Ozploitation cinema . Hartley knows how to make a documentary to the point , funny and always captivating . The interviews are hysterical -LRB- especially Bob Ellis , a critic who constantly bashes the genre in a comical uptight manner -RRB- and the clips are appropriate and show all the right parts . This will please all ages , from the older people who lived through this time and the younger generation -LRB- my friends and I -RRB- who will discover a new genre of Australian movies to enjoy . This doco is almost one of the best things to come out of the cinemas this year , and opens up a part of Australian culture that up until now was left hidden . Is this recommended ? YES ! Hopefully -LRB- and it DOES look hopeful -RRB- , Australia can start to release some great Ozploitation style films . With films like Rogue , Wolf Creek , Storm Warning , Black Water and Saw there is still a chance . A solid 5\/5 " ,10
" Joyous . A very fine documentary . I went into this at the London film Festival screening yesterday , never previously even having heard the term , ozploitation but came out ready to search out the films . A good film book will have you eager to google away to track down some hitherto unheard of ` must have ' and this movie does the same . I felt I should have taken a notebook with me to take down some of the titles so enthusiastically spoken of . The films celebrated here were made in the 70s and 80s and are an Australian equivalent of what would usually be called drive in or exploitation movies . Sex , violence , cars and fighting is generally the name of the game and the more extreme and wild the better . Numerous , high quality clips from the movies leave one open mouthed and the people who made them tell us amusing anecdotes and horrifying details of things that went wrong . All of this would be enough but we also get generous helpings of Barry Humphries and the ever reliable , ever enthusiastic , Quentin Tarantino , just in case we were not already convinced that some of these trashy movies are just the greatest movies ever made . Joyous . " ,9
" wow . I have wanted to see this film since I saw it advertised at the Melbourne Film festival so naturally I had to see it opening night when it came to my local cinema , I saw it last night and what can I say , it was fantastic , I had no idea that Australia made so many films in the 70 's and 80 's . The film features interviews with a lot of Australian directors , filmmakers , critics , some A list Hollywood actors and even Quentin Tarantino , who has an unbelievable knowledge of Australian exploitation cinema . The film explores the good , the bad and the ugly of Australian genre films . There is no doubt that there were some pretty dodgy ones made at the time but there is no denying that there were also some real gems made as well , it 's just a shame that they seemed to do better overseas than they did here . Weather you are interested in Australian film , Australian culture , or just film in general I highly recommend seeing this film . Listening to the filmmakers stories about how they made there films is both amusing and inspiring . Over all this is a fun movie that should be seen in the theater . " ,10
" wonderful documentary , and very funny . Thoroughly enjoyable - a few notes I made afterwards follow , including quotes from my wife First section of the movie covered how the new R-rating allowed an explosion in the Australian film industry . Specifically , as much nudity -LRB- boobs , pubes , and tubes -RRB- as the filmmakers could squeeze in ... `` And here was me thinking Australian film in the 70s was prudish . '' On John Holmes rather , ah , prominent role in the doco - Australia 's first exposure to him -LRB- or possibly the other way around -RRB- `` Would n't his head implode when he got an erection ? '' and about paying to see the movies covered `` We 're supporting the Australian film industry ! '' `` Given that quite a few of those movie were made to \* lose \* money ... '' The stories about the incredibly lax safety procedures at these flicks were pretty alarming . Take just one example from Mad Max -LRB- where the head stuntman arrived on his first day with one limb already broken ! -RRB- . Do you recall the shot in that movie , from the motorcyclist 's POV , where the bike is screaming along the highway and the odometer is hitting 180 ? The director got that shot by leaning over the motorcyclist 's shoulder with a camera . Helmet ? Hell no - protective equipment is for sane people . Tarantino 's excited fan-boy bouncing was amusing . Regarding one of the very few movies they covered that I actually recall seeing -LRB- I may well have seen more but have protected myself by blanking the memory -RRB- - Razorback . I wonder if this movie is the reason my old D D group would blithely deal with a pack of animated skeletons , but leg it for the nearest tree when an ordinary wild boar showed up ? Also - The Return of Captain Invincible ? Australia made a superhero musical ? All I can say is that Australia made some amazingly bad movies , \* that actually managed to get theatrical release \* . Still , it made me miss the old days of drive-in cinema , even if the only one I recall seeing at such a cinema was Death Race 2000 -LRB- the exploding baby scene - which I still find hugely funny -RRB- . If you have any interest in Australia 's contribution to cinematic immortality , you have to see this documentary :D " ,8
" OZploitation unveiling . Best documentary I 've seen this year . It feels as if these films have been swept under the carpet by a film industry which is overprotective of its image . The Australian film industry is so very narrow-minded and so it is great to see a documentary which has been so brilliantly edited but also used along with the great characters of the industry through the 70 's and 80 's who make this possible multiple movie preview so entertaining . There is a good mix of local and international actors\/producers\/directors and there is also contradictory comments and varying disagreements which merely adds to the movie myths . This film is also refreshing as it harks back to a time when the business was far from a business and less stringent with the absence of governing bodies which equates to many broken bodies and lots of bodies on show in terms of nudity . These films make me proud to be Australian . Thank you Mark Hartley . Now will someone just release them on DVD !! " ,8
" A one of a kind documentary . Documentary of Australian exploitation films from the late 1970s to the early 1980s . They 're presented in three section -- the sex movies , the horror movies and the action movies . There 's generous clips from various movies with LARGE doses of nudity -LRB- male and female -RRB- , sex , blood and gore -LRB- I 'm really surprised this got by with an R rating -RRB- . There 's also some very interesting interviews with the directors , producers , film critics and actors from the various films . Quentin Tarantino introduces each film . I was looking forward to this a lot . I love exploitation films and thought this might be fun . It was -- but I felt it was lacking somewhat . For one thing Tarantino gets annoying . It seems he loves each and every film which I question -LRB- Road Games is one of the most boring thrillers I 've seen -RRB- . Also with the exception of a few I have n't seen any of these films . They do explain them and why they 're here -- but I did n't know what EXACTLY they were talking about . The best parts were the interviews with the actors and actresses who talk about why they did the films and how they feel about them . It was especially surprising to see Jamie Lee Curtis discussing Road Games ! This is -LRB- obviously -RRB- for a very limited audience but it is fun and interesting . Just quite lacking something to put it over . I wanted to like it so much more but , as it stands , I can only give it a 7 . " ,7
" Excellent Informative doco ... . as a lover of ` Ozploitation '' films from way back , -LRB- hell im a card carrying member of the Turkey Shoot fanclub hahha -RRB- to say that Not Quite Hollywood was going to be essential viewing is quite an understatement . And so i finally made the 3 hour trek to Melbourne to see this thing and all i can say is WOW ! Mark Hartley has done good with what was available to him , however there were a few other films that never got a mention that are quite vital to the `` ozploitation '' story . To my knowledge COSY COOL was the first independent Aussie exploitation film , and it never even got a mention ! -LRB- admitedly its not a really great `` film '' , but is still an interesting watch -RRB- . 1979 slasher flick ALISON 'S BIRTHDAY never received a mention either , and quite crucially RUNNING ON EMPTY is only shown in a collage of car crashes , but nothing is said about it at all . And do n't even get me started on the absence of genuine classics like STIR , THE MONEY MOVERS , LAST OF THE KNUCKLEMEN . However it all really comes down to time . 2 hours is only really long enough to just skim the surface , which is what NQH does , and does a commendable job of it . In my eyes there are only 2 problems with NQH , one which is inevitable . . it has to end sometime . The second is why does everyone hate Turkey Shoot so bloody much ? It is a genuine classic and is definitely one of the most entertaining films to come out of Australia ! In summary a commendable effort and hopefully we will get all of these films appearing on DVD -LRB- and yes i already know that most of them are -RRB- " ,9
" This documentary is just pure entertainment ! . I wo n't be arty with this review . This film is an absolute ripper - a super fast paced documentary on the many genre films Australia produced in the 1970s 80s that were in many cases commercially successful but critically smashed by ` respectable ' reviewers at the time . I saw this last night at a premiere AFI Awards screening here in Melbourne and was blown away . There are so many good stories , amazing revelations and choice excerpts from literally dozens and dozens of outrageous Oz flicks here that if you are expecting a slow , monotonous talking heads-type doco that kills a few minutes in your evening , you will be happily mistaken . Stunt man deaths , John Holmes , fights with the Australian censor , copycat Italian film rip offs , sex , blood , martial arts fights on Uluru\/Ayers Rock , Mad Max , Turkey Shoot , Dennis Hopper going nuts , incredible car fetishistic filming , classic Oz Rock songs on the soundtrack -LRB- AC\/DC , Rose Tattoo , The Angels , Masters Apprentices et al -RRB- , great Tarantino quotes so much more - it 's absolutely all there . With docos starting to become more popular with cinema goers , I really hope that this film gets tons of bottoms on seats - I fully applaud the the amount of time the filmmakers must have have spent traveling acrosss three continents to get these interviews as well as the copyright nightmares of needing to clear so many films . Wow . My only -LRB- minor -RRB- criticism is that the film is so continually fast paced it just needs a little breathing room sometimes to let you take it all in and have a break . The film is very much at you all the time . As you can tell , I loved it and I reckon that even if you have never seen a single one of the source films , you are guaranteed to enjoy this wild ride into the commercial Oz film scene of a few decades back when this country actually had a varied and vibrant film industry . A brief side note - I think Tarantino is claiming credit for coining the collective term ` Ozploitation ' used to describe these films . Interesting ... " ,9
" Best Aussie doco yet . Having grown up watching these films , it was a pleasure to watch Not Quite Hollywood . It was fast paced and fascinating , the stories were funny and interesting , not at all like the dry boring documentaries that are being put out lately . I would have liked to have seen certain movies mentioned like , Last Of The Knucklemen , The Night The Hunter , The Plumber and Mama 's Gone A Hunting , but it covered many long lost gems . Many of these films are among Australia 's Lost Films , lost because a certain Premier leased them all to a Panama based company . It is good to see that they are gradually trickling back , but in the meantime , we have this excellent documentary to remind of that we once had a thriving and vibrant film industry . " ,10
" Superb documentary . This documentary detailing the wave of Aussie exploitation -LRB- better known as Ozploitation -RRB- films through the 70s and 80s is not only made with such passion , excitement , complemented further so by the anecdotes and praise from the key players of the wave and their fans , but is criminally underrated . The film is always interesting , educational , inspiring , and choc-a-block full of tits , pubes , blood , gore , and the sexiest cars\/car chases\/car accidents you 've ever seen . not only is this film so much fun , but it is the most important Australian film to come out this year because it gives the deserved praise to a wave of films that should 've been treated better and in retrospect have been forgotten -LRB- until now . And some of the featured films in the doco are thankfully getting their first DVD releases -RRB- . Thankfully , as the ending of the film details , Aussie film-makers are heading back to the days of Ozploitation and putting it in their movies , as seen in the likes of Wolf Creek , Saw , Undead , and Rogue . It 's also great hearing these directors , producers , writers and actors alike talking about how much fun , dangerous , and crazy it was to make these sorts of films , and how it was never inspired by how much money could be made -LRB- however , money was made , and Ozploitation did have an audience , mainly in countries outside of Australia -RRB- . This is an excellent , exciting , and informative documentary and is absolutely essential viewing for all aspiring film-makers . If this does n't get a Best Documentary nom at the Oscars , I will be disappointed . I hope to see it on more `` Top 10 in 08 '' lists , because it is certainly on mine . " ,9
" An entertaining potted history of modern Australian genre movies ... . I say `` modern '' Australian genre movies because I have heard in the past that Australia had a thriving homegrown cinema scene in the early part of last century , until US companies bought the screening venues here and -LRB- suprise , surprise -RRB- , started showing US movies instead of the local product . An example of US capitalism acting like a cuckoo on the world scene , perhaps . What you get in this docu is lots of talking heads and scenes from the movies being discussed . It 's a pretty entertaining combination . Some of the interviewees include American fan-boy Quentin Tarantino -LRB- a successful genre movie maker himself -RRB- , industry players like Phillip Adams and the politician Barry Jones , as well as the stars of the exploitation movies , like George Lazenby -LRB- Australia 's own James Bond -RRB- , Rebecca Gilling -LRB- whom I remember for her role in the brilliant trashy mini-series `` Return to Eden '' -RRB- , Lynda Stoner -LRB- of the great police soap `` Cop Shop '' -RRB- , Abigail -LRB- of the popular and notorious sex obsessed soap `` Number 96 '' -RRB- and Graeme Blundell , ` Alvin Purple ' himself and who would later feature in George Lucas ' Star Wars prequels . As well as the stars of these movies , you get interviews with the makers themselves ... be they the schlockmeisters you 've never heard of -LRB- unless your name is Quentin Tarantino ! -RRB- or people who would forge significant international careers like George Miller , who made the uber road carnage movie `` Mad Max '' . There are lots of interesting and entertaining inside stories on the movies which are mentioned here . Tales of the death of stunt people because the films were made in the days before there was any sort of safety oversight of them ... or the local media giving overseas stars a hard time because locals were n't getting their job . One time ` scream queen ' Jamie Lee Curtis fits into the latter category . Along with Stacy Keach , she is one of a few overseas insiders interviewed for the docu . She had a role in `` Road games '' with Keach , and I must say , my interest in seeing this movie has been piqued . Usually having an American in a local movie would signal to me that the film was a dog . `` Road games '' could be a genre movie which does n't vindicate that prejudice of mine . As far as the ` potted ' history of Australian cinema in recent times goes , that too is enlightening . Before we made our own movies , overseas productions would use our country for an exotic backdrop . Singer Mick Jagger playing Australian outlaw icon Ned Kelly is a major example of this phenomenon . We then started making gross out , populist comedies , like `` Alvin Purple '' and `` Barry McKenzie '' . If you are easily offended or have a squeamish sensibility , some of the clips may displease you . Some scenes are what you would expect from a gross out comedy , whilst some are more horrific , as you 'd expect to find from horror genre movies . The success of these genre movies had an ` Establishment ' backlash . The Aussie ` Renaissance ' in movies was more about presenting an image to the world which we felt comfortable with ... it was sort of a battle for Australia 's soul ... the ` evil ' populist side was abandoned as funding bodies supported more ` nice ' \/ ` proper ' subjects for movies . There is a very funny scene where famous Aussie satirist Barry Humphreys suggests that the art-house movie `` Picnic at Hanging Rock '' could have been even better if it had only had scenes of ... -LRB- wo n't spoil the surprise for you on that one ! -RRB- . Also fascinating in this docu is how Australian genre movies were influenced by overseas genre movies and vice-versa . E.g. it was a revelation to me that the notorious sex-romp creation `` Alvin Purple '' was basically taken from the premise of the British movie `` Alfie '' but with a plot twist used for comedic effect . Movies like `` Mad Max '' and `` Patrick '' had Italian rip-offs too , showing their influence on the world scene . Have heard recently that Australian genre movies like `` Patrick '' and `` Thirst '' are to be remade here . I 've seen the latter ... many years ago . Interesting take on the vampire genre ... I really only remember one visually stunning scene . This docu reminded me of another absolutely stunning scene from that movie ... you 'll see it too if you watch this docu . Fan-boy Tarantino often talks of arresting moments in such genre movies . The shower scene from Thirst would be an example that works for me . I 'm sure we like to imagine that we live in more liberated times than people did decades ago . Watching this docu , you 'll realize how mistaken you are ! In the 1970 's on Australian free to air TV , you could see full frontal male and female nudity on shows like `` Alvin Purple '' and `` Number 96 '' . You do n't get stuff like that nowadays ... not even on US shows which are on cable TV there . Sure , a lot of that stuff was sexist , but that is not hidden in this docu ... women like Jackie Weaver discuss this topic at some length . This docu has definitely piques my interest in some of these movies : must get around to watching `` Patrick '' one of these days , as well as revisiting `` Thirst '' some time too . No doubt due to some of the tax concessions the government offered , some absolutely worthless movies were made here . Those tax concession days are discussed here too , plus you get the points of view of people who have utter contempt for these movies -LRB- like Bob Ellis -RRB- as well as the out and out fan-boys , like Quentin Tarantino . Really , you do n't have to be Australian to appreciate this docu or even be that familiar with the movies which are covered here . It 's just a great over-view of a niche scene in the world . ... I suppose the only lamentable thing is that the early Australian cinema scene was killed by the US movie business . We had arguably the first motion picture ever made -LRB- `` The story of the Kelly gang '' -RRB- . How much richer could Australia 's cinema history have been if government had protected our industry ? " ,8
" a great , fun watch that works on several levels . You can watch NOT QUITE Hollywood as an eye-opening history of a somewhat under-appreciated subgenre or as simply a greatest hits of mind-blowing genre film moments . You will quite literally lose track of all the boobs , explosions , car crashes , mutilations , exploding heads and insane stunts offered up here . -LRB- I wanted to immediately watch it again to see all the stuff I missed ! -RRB- A fantastically entertaining documentary , highly recommended to fans of action , horror , or any kind of exploitation film . The film serves as a great starting point to research some fun flicks -LRB- I immediately sought out TURKEY SHOOT -RRB- . But if you just want to watch a string of crazy , outrageous movie moments regardless of appreciating their context , go for it . You win either way . " ,10
" Not Quite Hollywood is quite an entertaining tribute to the Australian drive-in era . Just watched this documentary of the Australian exploitation pictures of the '70s and '80s - known as Ozploitation - on Netflix Streaming . Quite fascinating to see scenes of various sex comedies -LRB- with all that full frontal nudity -RRB- , horror films -LRB- with plenty of gore -RRB- , and actioners -LRB- like the first Mad Max movie with Mel Gibson -RRB- represented here . Quentin Tarantino provides a fan perspective as we meet various producers , directors , stars , and many critics of Down Under provide many pro and con comments of those drive-in pictures . The only one-besides Mad Max-of them I 've actually seen showcased here was one called Road Games starring two Americans-Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis , both of whom are also interviewed . Many exciting scenes of that movie were shown but when I watched it as a kid on HBO , I did n't remember those but long boring stretches taking place on the road . Maybe I should watch it again to refresh my memory . Anyway , the way many of those money shots are presented are soooo quick cut edited that part of the time I found myself laughing especially whenever a particularly funny comment is said during them . So on that note , Not Quite Hollywood gets a recommendation from me . " ,8
" An awesome and informative documentary on an often overlooked chapter of exploitation history . In the wake of the social upheavals of the late 60s and early 70s , fiercely wild , brazen , and shameless exploitation pictures exploded across drive-in movie screens all over Australia . Made on shoestring budgets by blithely bold and driven maverick indie filmmakers , these movies pushed the envelope when it came to unflinchingly explicit content being presented full-on with a certain cheeky verve and delightful lack of inhibition . Indeed , the choice crazy clips showcased herein are ripe to bursting with gleefully vulgar humor , outrageously over-the-top action -LRB- nobody photographs madly careening vehicular carnage quite like the Aussies -RRB- , oodles of tasty female nudity , and unsparingly graphic violence . Energetically covering everything from bawdy soft-core comedies to slam-bang four-sheets-to-the-wind action to schlocky sci-fi to gory horror , edited with galvanizing rapid-fire ferocity , and rattling along at a dizzying speedy pace , this documentary bristles with a raw , trashy , and anarchic vitality that 's a total rowdy treat to behold . The eclectic array of interview subjects adds immensely to the infectiously delirious merriment : Down Under directors Richard Franklin , Brian Trenchard-Smith , Philippe Mora , and Russell Mulcahy , lovely actresses Cassandra Delaney , Lynda Stoner , Wendy Hughes , Joanne Samuel , Candy Raymond , and even super-smokin ' 70 's Penthouse model Cheryl Rixon -LRB- who still looks quite hot in her 50 's -RRB- , writer Everett De Roche , producer Anthony I. Ginnane , and actors Roger Ward , Jack Thompson , and John Waters . George Lazenby , Steve Railsback , Stacy Keach , Jamie Lee Curtis , and the always kooky Dennis Hopper relate plenty of cool stories about acting in films in the Land of Oz -LRB- the anecdotes about Hopper 's drug-fueled antics during the making of Mad Dog Morgan are simply priceless -RRB- . Moreover , there 's a wonderfully gonzo tribute to Grant Page , who 's without a doubt one of the most fearless and underrated stuntman in the history of cinema . The sole minor flaw in this otherwise excellent documentary is the ubiquitous Quentin Tarantino 's overly gushy fanboy raving ; while QT 's obvious knowledge on and affection for Ozploitation is genuine and admirable , his insufferably spazzy filmgeek posturing gets pretty tiresome after a while . Essential viewing . " ,9
" more listing off movies than behind-the-scenes stories , but essential viewing all the same . Not Quite Hollywood is n't a great documentary - in some ways the quality of its editing and how the interviews and clips are put together resembles a longer DVD special feature ` making-of ' history than a documentary . But it is really fantastic for someone like myself , who is always on the look-see for new and exciting -LRB- or just trashy -RRB- movies . I was aware of some of the Ozploitation films of the 70 's and 80 's , mostly through coming across some films of Philippe Mora -LRB- The Howling III , Mad Dog Morgan , Return of Captain Invincible , two of those three very good , one not so much -RRB- , and of course Mad Max , which is like the creme-de-la-creme of the output . But there was more , much more , and if you 're into crazy B-movie or just genre entertainment , it gives invaluable lots of new finds - it 's like , to quote Superbad , a Ghostbusters Treasure-Trove of Aussie-movies ! Not all of the movies look as appealing as they should . The one group that looked underwhelming just from the clips were the sex comedies , which , God bless em , looked like low-rent rip-offs of John Waters movies -LRB- i.e. Pink Flamingos -RRB- , which is saying a lot . It 's when the doc gets into the bloody , trashy and actually well-crafted stuff that it gets interesting . Better than that , filmmakers will come up on your radar you may have only heard in passing before . The big one here is Brian Trenchard Smith , who made a career out of just going to town with crazy car crashes , anything-goes horror , and intense action , and as his first film , kung-fu -LRB- The Man from Hong Kong , which provides one of the most entertaining sections of the film as \* everyone \* hates on the lead Asian star -RRB- . By the time the doc ends , not only will you know Smith 's name and how his films look so ballsy , but want to check out most of them as genuine articles of exploitation-fare . Other names are good to know too , like the man who makes Long Weekend , an animal-attack movie that has high production quality , or the movie Patrick by Richard Franklin -LRB- an intense admirer of Hitchcock -RRB- , and written by multiple Ozsploitation writer Everett De Roche . Of course we get Quentin Tarantino expounding his love for so many of these films - and sometimes not so much -LRB- the What is this s \*\*\* moment about one film in particular is very funny -RRB- . But it 's the actors and filmmakers and the critics , both the praising and the damning , that give the film a good boost as far as nuggets of the making-of the movies . As a documentary the best it does is to do what many good documentaries do : inform about a subject one does n't know so much about , with a little history -LRB- like Decade Under the Influence early on it talks about the changing times in Australia -RRB- , and as a guide for movie-geeks it 's like Christmas has arrived . " ,8
" It 's Not Quite Hollywood - and that 's a good thing ! . Not Quite Hollywood : The Wild , Untold Story of Ozploitation examines how Australia did n't really have a movie industry to call it 's own until the beginning of the Seventies , but once they got started the Aussies mostly bypassed making worthy and critically-respectable films , and instead embraced the various genres associated with low budget B movies , churning out sex comedies skin flicks , horror films and action thrillers . The documentary contains clips and discussion on many Australian films that I 've already seen or was aware of - TURKEY SHOOT , SKY PIRATES , SNAPSHOT , RAZORBACK , LOST WEEKEND , PATRICK , THE SURVIVOR , ROAD GAMES , HARLEQUIN , etc -LRB- sadly the wannabe sci-fi epic THE TIME GUARDIAN is only represented by a quick glimpse of it 's poster -RRB- - and a few that I 'd not previously heard of , but would now like to track down . FAIR GAME -LRB- 1985 -RRB- and THE MAN FROM HONG KONG both look as though they 're an absolute blast . There are dozens of interviewees , most of whom are surprisingly candid : Steve Railsback has nothing good to say about TURKEY SHOOT , and the movie 's producer admits that due to lack of time and money , live rounds were fired close to actors during some of the action scenes . Jamie Lee Curtis remembers being subjected to a hate campaign while shooting ROAD GAMES , for allegedly taking work away from Australian actresses . Wendy Hughes recalls that after doing a topless scene in one film , most of the reviews discussed the shape of her breasts at length and did n't mention her performance . Everybody involved in MAD DOG MORGAN tells of how Dennis Hopper spent the entire shoot out of his head on drugs -LRB- we see behind-the-scenes footage confirming this -RRB- , and Hopper himself reveals that during production he was arrested for drunk driving and the police doctor told him that based on the amount of alcohol in his bloodstream , he was technically dead . Not Quite Hollywood is a wonderful celebration of Australia 's frequently ignored movie output , and is well worth watching . " ,7
" List of Ozploitation Films Referenced in Not Quite Hollywood . After watching this awesome movie , I was more in love with Tarantino than ever and psyched to watch as many of the referenced movies as I could get my hands on -LRB- with a few exceptions that did n't appeal to me -RRB- .

" Aussie grunt and more ! . I saw this film at the Amsterdam Film festival last week , what a blast from the past ! This Doco was well executed and totally engrossing , accurate and entertaining . As an Aussie your not aware of the type of films we were offered at that time , its other nationalities which identify our styles years later , we just grew up with it and accepted it as the norm . Its great to see Tarrantino so enthusiastic about the Aussie film industry , the genre which was identified was the B films which at the time of release were considered OK , but these films have stood the test of time , what once was ridiculed as being rubbish is now being seen in a completely new light . I was surprised that Tarrantino talked at length about the film , Long Weekend which he considers on of his 5 favorite Aussie Horror films , at the time of watching it in the cinema i remember thinking this was one of the best made Aussie films i had ever seen ... so ... great minds think alike !! Watch this doco if you have any interest in the Aussie film industry , its a real eye opener and very well made . thumbs up and a big 10 ! " ,10
" a gold mine . Subtitled `` The Wild , Untold Story of Ozsploitation '' , and that 's what we get : a 100-minute cavalcade of all -LRB- ? -RRB- the dizzy highlights of Australian exploitation cinema . The parceling into sex comedy\/horror\/action subheadings serves the material quite nicely , giving us a broad view of the aesthetic : ideologically working class , plain-spoken , and very male . That latter point is given just enough emphasis as the female participants offer their diverse bewildered reactions to the paces the filmmakers put them through , without getting all superior ; the one pompous ass film critic who tries THAT trick is roasted on a spit . There 's a lot of initiative , energy , and inspiration on display in this exhausting avalanche of quick clips ; I was writing down titles like a mad man , there 's a lot of stuff I 'd never heard of that I 'm dying to see . Genre film-making is presented , rhetorically , as a polar alternative to the classy upmarketing of familiar exports like Peter Weir , Bruce Beresford et al. . . even though Beresford was responsible for the Barry McKenzie series and Weir bequeathed us The Cars That Eat People . But dichotomy or not , I can tell you with certainty that Patrick has now jumped The Last Wave on my must-see list . Quentin Tarantino is dispensed in quantity , but I did n't get annoyed ; he knows of what he speaks , and he 's well-mixed with the folks who were there . " ,8
" a compendium of schlock . It 's informative , all right , but after a very short while you realize that all you 're watching is a bunch of clips of junk exploitation pix mostly fatuous comments on them . OK , so Tarantino -LRB- we 're not on a first name basis -RRB- was blown way by the outrageous idea of having an almost nude woman as a hood ornament on a car . So what ? Some tastelessness is highly enjoyable -LRB- most of Tarrantino 's work is -RRB- because of style , panache great dialogue . With rare exceptions , the Ozploitation stuff shown in this pic is not . It 's just juvenile I 'm old enough to be sorry I wasted my time watching this one . Most of the reviewers have disagreed or will disagree with this comment . Well , that 's Show Biz . " ,2
" Unenlightening . This is another one of those worryingly fashionable and prominent documentaries that offers plentiful sound-bites set to almost non-stop music , but precious little insight . Like that terribly overrated skateboarding flick Dogtown And Z-Boys , this is a barrage of information that you did n't care to know , delivered by people sometimes visibly salivating at the prospect of recounting a story that is n't really worth telling . Many of these subjects are so rigorously determined to mythologize this period of Aussie film-making , that they end up telling tales that make them look like a smirking misanthropy collective . Was n't it funny when that actress nearly drowned , just because some schmuck of a director could n't get the shot that he wanted ? How about when Henry Silva , an actor petrified of heights , almost p \* ssed himself with fear because a camera crew took him 70ft off the ground without warning him ? And that Etc sequence in Patrick ? They considered giving the actor real shock therapy ! What lovable rogues ! What tw \* ts . Stir in the endless shrugging off of numerous instances of casual racism and misogyny , and you 're left with a pretty empty document of little genuine significance . There are a handful of interesting , level-headed contributors -LRB- one of them being an uncharacteristically restrained Quentin Tarantino -RRB- but there is no form , structure or analysis of any cultural impact that this movement may have had . Which is a shame , because such analysis may have justified the film 's existence . There may well be valuable things to say about this subject , but it 'll take a much more ambitious director to do it . " ,4
" An adequate documentary about inadequate film . I generally love documentaries about film . However , this one was just so-so . One reason is because it seemed to be a Tarantino masturbation fantasy . This is a man who should never step out from behind the camera . Another reason is the subject matter itself is just bad . I did like learning about the catalogue of incredibly bad films that Australia has produced over the years , apparently with some government funding attached . As a Canadian , it makes me feel less embarrassed by the total garbage we usually produce . I ca n't imagine what sort of fans we have , but maybe someone will make a really earnest and boring documentary about them . Of all the films they referenced , the only one I liked was Wolf Creek , -LRB- although Dead End Drive In was n't too bad -RRB- . So there 's hope for the gore genre . Maybe budgets and technology have risen to the level required to do these movies justice . Anyway , for this to be a decent documentary , it should have included some other things ... maybe more of a comparison with the crap films of other countries , or with more moderate Australian cinema -LRB- I assume there was such a thing -RRB- . Really , we are n't given much context . Still , it does give you a good sense of what was out there , and I was blissfully unaware of most if it until now . But I ca n't say I 'm motivated to see any more of it ... In 2010 we have choices . I think that was missing back in the day . " ,7
" Down Under at the Top ! . Having watched Not Quite Hollywood : The Wild , Untold Story of Ozploitation ! is eventually going to cost me a lot of money in the long run , as I added yet another handful of obscure movies to my never-ending list of ` absolutely-must-track-down-purchases ' . That is actually the main reason why horror and cult fanatics ought to check this spirited and cheerful documentary out ! Not so much because it 's highly informative and professionally made -LRB- which it is -RRB- , but mainly because this literally is a gravy train of virtually unknown but seemingly delicious genre titles . You can watch this documentary with a pen notebook next to you and just start writing down the titles of all out-and-out demented movies they show brief clips of , and I assure that near the end you 'll have a whole page full ! In case the extended title does n't make it clear enough yet , Not Quite Hollywood is a documentary revolving on the Australian exploitation\/B-movie industry in general . This production features tons of clips from movies of the different streams in cult cinema -LRB- vulgar 70 's sex flicks , brutally gore horror and outrageous car\/biker movies -RRB- , interviews with practically all the pioneers of Aussie cult cinema -LRB- like Brian Trenchard-Smith , Richard Franklin and Everett De Roche -RRB- and over-enthusiast testimonies for younger generation directors about how influential these movies were -LRB- Greg McLean , James Wan and particularly the always-hyperkinetic Quentin Tarantino -RRB- . The footage and interviews covering the Sexploitation stream was the least interesting part for me , because I 'm not that interested in those films . Still it was nevertheless worthwhile seeing , as this meant the launch of the Aussie exploitation industry , with director icons like John Lamond and Tim Burstall giving birth to Down Under sleaze and vulgarity . There 's a surprisingly high amount of little interviews with lewd actresses of that time , so it 's really fun to see them showing off their T A first and then talk about how carefree this era was . The horror movies -LRB- comatose killers outback chillers -RRB- and exploitation flicks -LRB- high octane disasters and kung-fu masters -RRB- are a non-stop spitfire of fantastic images , compelling background information , marvelous on-set anecdotes and enticing bits of gore . It 's always a brilliant experience to watch so many of your cinematic heroes assembled in one documentary , and Not Quite Hollywood accomplishes exactly this . " ,8
" The Butcher . If you want to see Eric Roberts kill a lot of people , then ` The Butcher ' is the movie for you . As ridiculous as they are , I have an affinity for these one man army movies where someone , on his own , must overcome a militia , in this case a mobster 's goons . Roberts is a mobster 's enforcer , the guy who is an expert at removing thorns from the ass of his boss . This mobster , Murdoch -LRB- Robert Davi -RRB- has his eyes on money laundering , and sets up Merle -LRB- Roberts -RRB- to take the fall regarding the theft of a heavy Reno crime family . It 's actually a more complex scheme where Murdoch had plans to use a hot shot in his entourage , eyeing the throne , Eddie -LRB- Jerry Trimble -RRB- , to sweep in to steal the money from the owner of an expensive stripper club , Doyle -LRB- Paul Dillon -RRB- , who uses the joint as a front for the money laundering operation . Merle is sent there to collect money owed , foiling Murdoch 's plan to have him iced and left to take the fall for attempting to steal the cash for himself . This does n't bode well with Merle , to put it mildly , and he decides to take a dropped duffel bag of money with him as a retirement fund . Having that money is bad enough , but his decision to seek revenge against Murdoch places his life in serious jeopardy . In a spur of the moment , with nothing to lose , Merle asks a waitress at Murdoch 's bar , Jackie -LRB- Irina Bj rklund -RRB- to come away with him . Like the action sequences , Eric delivers his part in style , blasting hoods and looking great doing it . Nice supporting turns by Keith David as Larry Cobb , a loan shark demanding money owed to him by Merle , and Geoffrey Lewis , as Merle 's weapons supplier , Naylor . Davi has the snake-in-the-grass mobster role he performs with ease , eliciting a dangerous aura when he 's in a scene . Irina Bj rklund is a nice surprise as this young woman with an unfulfilled life who decides to take a chance , hopping in Merle 's car for a little excitement , the threat of peril always near . There 's violence aplenty , with bullets ripping apart bodies , the use of blood bags in heavy supply . Bokeem Woodbine is Chinatown Pete , a compulsive gambler who never loses , yet Merle , an obvious failure in the past , finds luck and earns some cash which will be used properly , perhaps something of substance provided by a man who kills men for a living . The final bloodbath , guns a blazing , goes on forever and delivers in spades . Roberts looks quite cool in his shades and '69 Dodge Charger . The plot is really just an excuse for Roberts to rid the world of mobster scum . Again , to reiterate , these movies are bound to make many an eye role , but it 's like smack to a junkie , when it comes to my love for them . . I ca n't help but gravitate towards them . " ,8
" Brilliant throwback style action movie ! . This is a world of granite faced crusty badass mothers ! These guys are n't pretty , in fact nobody in this movie is pretty . But they are tough , and what they lack in looks they more than make up for in ferocity of action . Robert davi is fantastic as the pock marked faced lee j. cobb mob boss , he does n't like Earl , Eric Roberts ' character , but like all the people in this movie they do n't give away what they 're thinking or who they like , or even what side they 're on , and when the chips are down and they 're in trouble , they all offer to join the other team to save their bacon , anyway . The only character with any real shred of discernible decency at all is Eric Roberts , and he is at the losing end of a run of seriously bad luck - see the movie . This film was constructed strangely , it was really slow , and it bugged me a bit , then I realized I really enjoyed the slow build up , because , brother let me tell you , when this movie goes bang , it takes large gruesome fragments of the san fernando valley with it . In glorious old school no CG style . The guns are real and sound real , the guts and splatter seems gruesomely real , too . I do n't normally write on these boards , most people with the time to write do n't share my opinion anyway . But a complete miscreant made a comment about the guns , I had a sudden flash of wanting to use a 1897 shot gun to flatten his head , like Earl does in the movie . The firearms in this movie are cool , there are no modern guns at all , they are all beat up old collectors items -LRB- like the characters , i guess -RRB- , the gun in the stripclub is a Browning 1919 BTW , was n't in WW1 at all , and no bayonet on it , - but like I said , I 'm as pathetic as him for getting annoyed about his review . This film is uncompromising and fresh , the style is gritty and almost messy , Eric Roberts is stand alone , a fantastic actor , and Davi battles him good for the scenery chewing awards . Michael ironside gives a small speech on gangster etiquette at the beginning and I can now quote it verbatim , it 's a small part but it stays with you ! earl 's car deserved it 's own credit in the titles , as it 's a character unto itself . The bottom line . As i watched this film , it felt interesting and new , but a little slow getting to it 's point , then the shooting happened and a divine light came over me and it all made sense . I have watched it three more times and most assuredly get it now . This is a blistering individual film , a head and shoulders above most of the steamy crXp in the theater . This film is n't about the plot , or the suspense or any of that stuff , it 's about the characters and the world they live in and boy i enjoyed it . Terry . C. " ,10
" The Butcher serves up some old school action . . Having followed director Jesse V. Johnson 's career since 2002 's The Honorable it 's amazing how quickly he has evolved into a top notch action director in such a relatively short period of time . The man has toiled away and paid his dues so it 's nice to see his skill is becoming recognized by his peers , allowing him to recruit some great talent . His 2009 film The Butcher slowly builds up momentum towards a brutal action packed finale . It does so skillfully and all the while remained interesting , unlike say for example The Kingdom starring Jaime Foxx which had dull dialog and uninteresting characters for three quarters of the film trusting that the final action packed reel would make up for it -LRB- as terrific as it was , it did not -RRB- . The Butcher on the other hand , has barely a fraction of the budget and fires on all cylinders , well scripted , great leads in Eric Roberts and Robert Davi , excellent cast -LRB- including several of the director 's stock actors such as Keith David , Bokeem Woodbine , and even a cameo by the Pitfighter himself Dominiquie Vandenberg -RRB- , grade A staged action with superb stunt work , one of the best musical scores I 've heard in some time , even a beautiful Dodge Charger and eclectic mix of firearms . Recommended ! " ,8
" Cool , Gritty , Hardboiled Action Movie . Eric Roberts is Hench , a henchman for a crime boss played by Robert Davi . After several loyal years to Davi 's character , things go wrong when Hench gets ambushed during a shakedown . Unlike most movies , however , Hench ends up with some big money and a girl -LRB- the beautiful Irina Bjorklund -RRB- , and plots his bullet-riddled revenge against Davi and the men who crossed him . The Butcher was pretty sweet . You can tell that the films director , the up and coming Jesse V. Johnson , is experienced behind the camera . He knows what an audience -LRB- in this case mostly male -RRB- wants to see ; Action . And that 's what you get with The Butcher , Eric Roberts shooting his way out of a life he 's tired of squandering . The action is terrific , the sets are cool , and the overall effect is a nicely done action piece . Roberts does a great job , convincingly playing a cool , badass henchman . For once he does n't overplay the role , instead he 's cool as can be , even when the bullets fly . Irina Bjorklund is a great up and comer as well . Davi fills a great performance as the film 's antagonist , a major crime boss who 's about to go down . Keith David , Bokeem Woodbine , and a small appearance by Michael Ironside round out the cast , all in terrific performances . Overall a very cool action movie . " ,9
" Letdown . The Butcher has a decent cast and a promising story line , but fails to deliver due to a crummy script and too unrealistic action scenes . The wording of the plot outline is indicative of the incoherent bombastic dialogue in this film , it makes practically all actors appear wooden and insincere . A lot of the budget was thrown at bloody shootouts , but no attention was paid to making them even a little realistic . In most shootouts the henchmen just stand upright blazing away without seeking cover or even actually trying to hit the protagonist . In another shootout the bad guys insist on shooting above the furniture behind which the hero is hiding . Not even film goons are that stupid . These flaws ruin what otherwise could have been a palatable action film . " ,4
" Dark and gritty crime drama . . I had no expectations for this movie . From the title I guessed it was a B-grade slasher flick of some kind . What I got was something completely different . The Butcher is a dark and gritty story about a man with nothing to lose , made in the style of the classic movies of the same kind in 70 's . Eric Roberts is good in the title role and most of the actors do their job quite well . The action is raw and naked without being over the top and the overall feel and atmosphere is gritty and dirty . I recommend this film for people who like gangster and action movies from the 70 's . 7\/10 " ,7
" Kickass action movie that fizzles out . Over-the-top violence with an incredulous plot line . Why the police never catch up to this guy just further eludes to the fairy-tale concept . Reminds me of a film noir minus the black and white . A lot of 1940 's themes , cheesy lines and concepts set in the modern age . The movie is filled with violent bloodbaths mirroring that of a Steven Seagal fight scene . How this guy comes out on top is clearly some well executed choreography . It leaves the viewer in utter disbelief . It basically takes a turn for the worse and loses momentum like a lead balloon like the director gained a terrible drug addiction and just did n't care anymore . I almost feel like I 've been violated . This one is probably a good film if you 're on a psychedelic drug because it is all hype and little else . " ,4
" Eric Roberts and a bunch of character actors in a meaningless movie . . . The Butcher gets high marks for a high body count , in other words lots of bang bang , but little else . Eric Roberts is his usual dependable quirky self , and it 's nice to see Robert Davi and Geoffrey Lewis getting some work . This is however a very shallow movie , with everything revolving around the ultra violent scenes . The whole film has almost zero meaning . Eric Roberts never changes his sport coat throughout the entire movie , and really the movie never changes either . It is nothing more than just another weak plotted shoot em up , with little or no character development . I say avoid unless you need to see a bunch of seldom used actors in a meaningless movie . - MERK " ,4
" Heroic Bloodshed in the West . This review contains spoilers !!!!!! It is so refreshing to have a solid shoot em up -LRB- the only other movie maker I 've watched that loves guns as much as the director is John Woo -RRB- with heart and that 's what makes the Butcher stand out from other flicks of this genre , it makes it so much more than just an action film . The script has such a good sense of humor , the players all come together , the banter between Eric Roberts , Keith David , Robert Davi and Geoffrey Lewis just oozed cool -LRB- ooze used in a positive sense had that hard boiled noir feel -RRB- and there were those little touches like the money launderer putting the pin back in the grenade -LRB- commenting that he 'd do it when his henchman offers -RRB- , the horrific nature of fire fights -LRB- not everyone dies from a clean wound through the heart at high noon , the panic \/ mania \/ fear , fingers get shot off , shotguns and heads equate to Bolognese -RRB- . Yes there is a level of overkill , but then we deserve it , its the finale ! I enjoyed the soundtrack , nice classical background fare providing that calm from the storm . The bittersweet ending worked perfectly , so many films about betrayal and redemption can become utterly nihilistic , but the Butcher is not about that , it felt like it was more about learning from mistakes , keep living until you 're done and try to do the decent thing in indecent circumstance . That 's what heroes should be about , giving hope or making a difference . But then maybe I just love the old school heroic bloodshed movies . If you enjoyed Johnny To 's Exiled , then check this out . The director Jesse V Johnson 's style is constantly evolving and he just keeps getting better . Bring on Charlie Valentine Mr Johnson !

" A Revolution Waiting to Happen . Michael Skolnik has made a solid -LRB- and understated -RRB- documentary about the king of Swaziland and his ultra-opulent lifestyle -- a fleet of limousines , a luxury personal jet , his own private army , about $ 9 billion in offshore accounts , and a sumptuous personal palace for himself and his 13 wives -LRB- he was apparently building separate palaces for 11 of his wives while this film was being made -RRB- . The king also has a teen-age daughter who speaks with an American accent , attends college in California , and -LRB- remarkably -RRB- says about Swaziland 's culture : ` without the king , there is no culture . ' This gives the film its title , but it 's also an ominous play on words for the probable fate of her father . The comment pompously suggests that the people of Swaziland had little , if anything , to do with the development of their own culture . It is reminiscent of Louis XIV 's alleged remark ` L'etat , c'est moi ' -LRB- ' I am the state ' -RRB- . King Mswati III rules with supreme authority , although Swaziland nominally has a prime minister , cabinet and a legislative body -- all appointed by the king himself and all quartered behind closely guarded walls . In the midst of all the king 's luxury , the great majority of Swazis live in misery and near-starvation . The country -LRB- pop . 1.8 million -RRB- has the world 's highest HIV\/AIDS rate -LRB- about 46 per cent -RRB- and the lowest life-expectancy -LRB- about 31 years -RRB- . People must depend on the World Food Programme for survival . Revolutions foment inevitably in these conditions -LRB- ` Freedom in Our Lifetime ' is prominently stencilled on the back of one of the rebel leader 's t-shirts -RRB- . The viewer is not surprised to hear these sentiments repeated many times , a stark contrast to the king and his many courtiers , who are so detached from their country 's realities that they 're not sure what all the fuss is about . The king pays lip service to the terrible conditions in his country , but he has had 20 years in which to do something about it . He has n't , and he does n't , and he will surely go the way of other supreme rulers who did not heed that famous writing on the wall . This film was made only a year ago -LRB- in early 2007 -RRB- , so watch for future reports from Swaziland . " ,8
" It 's good to be the king . A nice little 3-part tale shows us the king of Swaziland , the last absolute monarch in the world : his wives , palatial accommodations , fleet of luxury cars , etc. . The filmmaker obviously enjoyed extraordinary access to the king and the royal family , and the king has a great deal to say about his role and his responsibilities . Unfortunately , all that talk seems wildly at odds with reality . Swaziland has the world 's lowest life expectancy . The prevalence rate of AIDS in the population is almost 43 % . The people earn roughly $ .63 per day and subsist on donated food and offal . There is talk of revolution from many people who must now be at risk for espousing treason on camera . There is also the princess , sold to us as a rather spoiled brat who equates her father with the nation 's culture , and can not imagine the willful denial of either . She begins to see things through another point of view , but how far will that go ? " ,10
" Excellent but biassed documentary on Swaziland . I 've been waiting for some time to see this documentary as I have been living and working in Swaziland since 1985 . We are given a fairly honest look at some parts of Swaziland - the monarchy on the one hand and on the other hand the upcoming generation , many of whom are living on the outskirts of the main towns , Mbabane and Manzini , in the hope of making a better living in the towns but devoid of any means to produce their own food and therefore living in great poverty if they should fail to find some form of occupation . However there are also other groups of which nothing is shown in the documentary - the business people earning good salaries and living a stable life and those in the rural areas , staunch supporters of the monarchy and who are mostly subsistence farmers . What was the aim of Michael Skolnik in making the documentary ? Was he trying to warn the world of a possible revolution in the country ? If so , why did he not also speak to the intelligentsia , many of whom are also disillusioned with the monarchy and would probably have been a better choice to influence world leaders rather than having to listen only to aggressive people , many of whom were obviously intoxicated while being interviewed ? If his intentions was to give the world a picture of what is going on in Swaziland , -LRB- the good and the bad -RRB- then it would have been better if people from other backgrounds could also have been included . A few remarks on some of the more sensational things shown in the documentary : At one point it is said that people are so poor that they have to eat intestines from cows and chicken heads and feet . Although this is not my personal favorite , for many Swazi people this is a delicatessen which they enjoy eating . Frozen chicken pieces are sold in stores in packages which include the head and feet . The empty churches have absolutely nothing to do with the fear of people to gather for prayer . That is absolute rubbish ! Most churches in Swaziland are small and not well attended , even though it is considered to be a Christian country , but this has nothing to do with any restrictions from government . The problem of AIDS is accurately shown in the documentary , except that the situation is even worse than is shown in the movie . " ,7
" Very touching ... but what are the answers ? . I enjoyed this documentary very much , as I knew very little about Swaziland and it opened my eyes to a country that has many problems -- not the least of which is the highest AIDS infection rate in the world . While this is only a small portion of the film , this certainly does not bode well for the future of this tiny nation . Whether or not they have a king or democratic government or anarchy , this problem certainly is n't going away soon . The major thrust of the film , however , was on the political situation . Swaziland is the last kingdom in Africa and the king is THE government . He elects all of the government leaders in control of everyday decisions and he has the right to veto anything his hand picked men do . Additionally , according to the new constitution , he is exempt from the nation 's laws . This is rather insane and anachronistic in the 21st century and I agree with the film makers that this is n't good . However , what is only alluded to briefly is that Africa has a history over the last 65 years of violent revolutions and chaos -- making this once-fertile continent a more wretched place than it needs to be . So , as the film makers seem to say that major changes are needed , what needs to be done and how to do this without complete civil war and death ? Fortunately , I saw some glimmer of hope here and there -- but you really had to look for it in the film . Whether or not these problems will be solved and how withstanding , the film definitely makes you think and you ca n't help but be affected by WITHOUT THE KING . It was a great conclusion to the film seeing the king 's oldest daughter -LRB- who has always been pampered and sheltered -RRB- coming face to face with an impoverished AIDS orphanage . Perhaps there is some hope . " ,8
" Excellent . We thank you about the excellent work done on this documentary . I am not surprised at some comments that this piece of excellent work is biased . All those that have benefited from this regime shall cry foul , because you can not spit on your sit . There is serious brutality and a highest level of intimidation . It should be noted , that in Swaziland - which could have been covered is that decisions of the courts can not be adhered to . As i write , the commissioner of police is in contempt of court and can not be booked . The judges of the court of appeal had resigned enmasse due to non implementation of courts judgements for persons who are friends and cronies to the regime . Corruption and theft is the order of the day . Millionares have mushroomed in a day and no one cares , so long as you are below the royal umbrella . People have been displaced by forced removal from land of birth and some self exiled with fear of state brutality . I say this masterpiece just gave a clue of the real Swaziland . THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK , MAY THE ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU ALL . " ,10
" Made to SELL . It is a great pity that someone out there gets the information but chooses not to tell it as it is but to make a buck . Swaziland has some of the happiest people who are taken care of by their country . Either than give them handouts , they get land to live and work which gives them dignity . People have gotten so used to mass actions that they tend to want others to work to support them . Its a sad situation and Swaziland does not encourage it . I have lived there most of my life and have seen poor and rich . What is poor when you can have fields given to you , and grazing land allocated for your cattle . Give a man in the -LRB- poor -RRB- rural area money and he may have no use for it because all he\/she needs comes from the soil . And to say they OPT for intestines is not true because they actually find them quite the treat , and they are . Just because someone thinks they can choose for other people what is good for them and what is not , does not necessarily mean they know anything . Saying the people live below poverty line because they live below the cost of $ .68 a day seriously does not mean that they are starving . Unless starving for you is not putting money into the pockets of the already rich . I challenge the honest money maker -LRB- if they exist -RRB- to go back and remake the film\/documentary with some truth and research , and then make your call . And make it for another country and tell whoever will listen that there is paradise out there where there are no people living in what is called poverty . At least Swaziland will provide one with a start , and then its up to each individual to take it from there . You want to work for a living then you make it . You want to live on handouts , then it is your choice to make . " ,10
" Without the king . The trailer for the film looks intense . It 's hard to believe that there is a country with a life expectancy of 31 yrs . of age . The Aids crisis is ridiculous.I 'm interested in finding out what the Kings response is to his kingdom 's issues . The princess appears like she really wants to help her country . I ca n't imagine the dilemma she must face between choosing her father or the people of her country . The crazy thing about the situation is that it 's real life . I think this film will get people talking about what is going on in Swaziland . The independent film community in NYC is buzzing about the film . The director seems to be young and focused . I ca n't wait to see it this weekend . " ,9
" with a king . I watched your documentary sir , and i can say I was very impressed by your skill to destroy a country like that . Sir , the country is not as poor as you depicted it , you 've been here and you know that . You are quite aware of all the efforts the king is making towards the welfare of the people of the kingdom , but you decide to send a different picture to the world . WHY ? True there are poverty stricken areas in SD , but Moneni was the wrong choice.First , because it 's a township under the town council not Gov. secondly , the water you showed is not the water they drink , you just chose a dirty pond for livestock and that is evident in your documentary as you showed the cleaner water they use for their laundry . phew !!!!! Your documentary is not the true reflection of the people and the beautiful kingdom because it does n't give different views so it appears that it is a tool you and your friends -LRB- lousy political parties of Sd -RRB- are using to spark violence in the kingdom . In the documentary , no one is speaking on the side of the king but he himself , who will believe him ? We wanted to put our views on that doc . Eish !!! that was very undemocratic ` sir ' . Sir , you need to know that the people who always cram the stadiums on the His Majesty 's call are not doing that only because they love their culture but because they seriously love and support their King . Would you love someone who hates you ? Would you listen to lying lips telling you they love you if you know exactly they do n't ? Actions speak louder than words , and never at any point will you hear the king telling his people he loves them - ACTION . But they just love him . Watch during Traditional ceremonies , almost 10 % of the population goes there . Just last week , we had the people 's parliament and people crammed the place to forward their views . Then watch during these rallies which are against the king , you will see the nation standing on pavements just looking at what is going on . Sir , you know exactly that the whole nation is in deeply in the king 's heart . you have spent much time with him while making this documentary which HE allowed you to and innocently answered all your questions giving you perfect answers . I think He should be on fire if he does not do anything about this documentary because it is not an insult to him but the whole Swazi nation , so if he really loves us , he should protect us from such . Lastly , it is serious that the luxury the king is enjoying should be watched with open eyes but honestly speaking , it is not true that that Swaziland is poor should be seen in the king 's eyes . That he should attend all international duties without food in the stomach because the Swazis are hungry . The people of the kingdom do n't want that . Just like any other head of state , so should our king appear , period . Look I stay in swaziland but , Where is this fleet of limousines you are talking about ? " ,1
" What was the casting dept thinking ?? . Well , in a nutshell , lots of no names with a soggy plot . Who are most of these people ? The drinking problem storyline is way overdone ! It was a good concept , but not enough attention to who they cast in the flick . I wish the cover photo was more detailed , it just looks like a scribbled drawing from a middle schooler with issues . There was some ` would be ` scary moments , but its 2008 , even youtube clips are scary if the watcher is caught off guard , right ? Made for t.v , maybe but a motion picture ? It 's mainly D list at best . -LRB- maybe E , lol -RRB- I am not a pro critic , this is just my opinion . Do n't get me wrong ... I love horror movies , but this movie is a horror ! " ,2
" This could be a `` so '' good movie . What first hit me was that this is such a brilliant movie . Then I watched the other 60 minutes and it all faded away . The director of this movie has done a lot of TV stuff and will probably have to stay with that . The cast is a laugh because they are mixing good performance with old TV stars that should have retired or just stayed with TV . The plot is excellent , the effects are really scary . But the long drown out discussions should have been cut out to make a better flow to the movie . The biggest mistake they made in this movie is to concentrate on the lead character 's drinking problems and if his boss is gon na believe the star characters visions again , and again and again . This is a pretty good movie that is obviously made fore TV and should stay there . But with just a little more effort it could have been a very good movie . It 's good , but its just not making it . How ever its not a waste of time . But it could have been so much more !!!!! " ,4
" Nifty supernatural serial killer thriller . Detective Nick Ferguson -LRB- a solid and believable performance by Rhett Giles -RRB- has a near fatal run-in with vicious serial killer Teddy -LRB- a creepy and convincing portrayal by Richard Tyson -RRB- , who 's been terrorizing the city of Los Angeles by murdering young women and removing their organs . After receiving a new heart and recovering in the hospital , Ferguson continues his obsessive search for Teddy . However , Ferguson has now acquired psychic abilities that enable him to have horrific visions of Teddy 's victims as they 're being tormented and murdered . Director\/co-writer Kevin Carraway relates the absorbing story at a steady pace , develops a considerable amount of tension , delivers a fair amount of grisly graphic gore , and tosses in a few neat and surprising twists . Moreover , Ferugon makes for an appealingly flawed and troubled protagonist and his nightmarish visions are genuinely spooky and unsettling . This film further benefits from sound acting by the capable cast : Giles holds everything with his sturdy work as Ferguson , with fine support from Steven Williams as Ferguson 's profane and hard-nosed superior Captain Bradley , Miranda Kwok as helpful psychic Kathryn , and John Duerler as diligent forensics expert Dr. Youngblood . Both Henryk Cymerman 's slick cinematography and the rattling score by Mel Lewis are up to speed . Worth a watch . " ,8
